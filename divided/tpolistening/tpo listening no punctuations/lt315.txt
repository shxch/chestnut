We ve been talking about the decline of coral reefs in tropical areas all over the world…um… how natural and man made stresses are causing them to degrade  and in some cases  to die
So now let s focus on a specific example of a natural predator that can cause a lot of damage to coral reefs the Crown of Thorns  or CoT starfish  The Cot starfish is found on coral reefs in the tropical Pacific Ocean and it eats coral  Now  in small numbers  the starfish don t affect coral reefs dramatically  But periodically  starfish population explodes  And when that happens  the reefs can become badly damaged or even destroyed  something we are trying very hard to prevent  For example  during the 1960s  there was an outbreak of CoT starfish in the Great Barrier Reef  off the east coast of Australia  Luckily  the CoT starfish population gradually declined on its own and the reefs recovered
But we were left wondering – what cause the population to increase so suddenly  Well  over the years  we ve come up with a few hypotheses  All still hotly debated
One hypothesis is that it s a natural phenomenon  that the starfish naturally undergo population fluctuations following particularly good spawning years
There are also several hypotheses that suggest some sort of human activities are partly responsible  like fishing  There are fish and snails that eat starfish  particularly the giant triton snail  which is the main predator of the starfish  These fish and snails have themselves experienced a decline in population because of overfishing by humans  So with a decline in starfish predators  the starfish population can increase
Another hypothesized human related cause is fertilizer runoff  People use fertilizer for their crops and plants and a lot of it eventually makes its way from land into the seas  It s fertilizer  so it has a lot of nutrients  These nutrients have an effect on the starfish  because they cause an increase in the growth of phytoplankton  Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that grow in the ocean  Larval CoT starfish eat phytoplankton in their first month of life  so more fertilizer in the ocean means more phytoplankton  which means more starfish  bad for the reefs
Now  the final hypothesis has to do with storm events  If some reefs are destroyed by storms  starfish populations that inhabited those reefs would have to condense and concentrate on the reefs that are left  So this can cause a kind of mass feeding frenzy
So we have ideas  but no real answer  And because we aren t sure of the causes for starfish population increases  it s difficult to prevent them  I mean  some progress has been made  For example  new survey techniques have enabled us to detect population increases when the starfish are quite young  so we can be ready for them  But meaningful progress requires much better evidence about the cause
On the bright side  in all the research being done on causes  we have discovered something related to how starfish populations might affect coral reef diversity  We think that when reefs are damaged  after a few years  the fastest growing corals repopulate the areas  And these fast growing species can grow over the slower growing species of coral  denying them light and preventing them from recovery  However  the faster growing species are the preferred food of the CoT starfish  So when an outbreak of CoT starfish occurs  they thin out the fast growing coral and may give the slower ones a chance to reestablish  So without the outbreak  the diversity of coral would be reduced
