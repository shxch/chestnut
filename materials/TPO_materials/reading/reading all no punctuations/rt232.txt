Seventeenth Century Dutch Agriculture
Agriculture and fishing formed the primary sector of the economy in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century  Dutch agriculture was modernized and commercialized new crops and agricultural techniques raised levels of production so that they were in line with market demands  and cheap grain was imported annually from the Baltic region in large quantities  According to estimates  about 120 000 tons of imported grain fed about 600 000 people  that is about a third of the Dutch population  Importing the grain  which would have been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch to have produced themselves  kept the price of grain low and thus stimulated individual demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods
Apart from this  being able to give up labor intensive grain production freed both the land and the workforce for more productive agricultural divisions  The peasants specialized in livestock husbandry and dairy farming as well as in cultivating industrial crops and fodder crops  flax  madder  and rape were grown  as were tobacco  hops  and turnips  These products were bought mostly by urban businesses  There was also a demand among urban consumers for dairy products such as butter and cheese  which  in the sixteenth century  had become more expensive than grain  The high prices encouraged the peasants to improve their animal husbandry techniques  for example  they began feeding their animals indoors in order to raise the milk yield of their cows
In addition to dairy farming and cultivating industrial crops  a third sector of the Dutch economy reflected the way in which agriculture was being modernized horticulture  In the sixteenth century  fruit and vegetables were to be found only in gardens belonging to wealthy people  This changed in the early part of the seventeenth century when horticulture became accepted as an agricultural sector  Whole villages began to cultivate fruit and vegetables  The produce was then transported by water to markets in the cities  where the consumption of fruit and vegetables was no longer restricted to the wealthy
As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and industry increased  agricultural land became more valuable and people tried to work the available land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes  In order to increase production on existing land  the peasants made more use of crop rotation and  in particular  began to apply animal waste to the soil regularly  rather than leaving the fertilization process up to the grazing livestock  For the first time industrial waste  such as ash from the soap boilers  was collected in the cities and sold in the country as artificial fertilizer  The increased yield and price of land justified reclaiming and draining even more land
The Dutch battle against the sea is legendary  Noorderkwartier in Holland  with its numerous lakes and stretches of water  was particularly suitable for land reclamation and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster Lake which began in 1608  The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7 100 hectares of land  Forty three windmills powered the drainage pumps so that they were able to lease the reclamation to farmers as early as 1612  with the investors receiving annual leasing payments at an interest rate of 17 percent  Land reclamation continued  and between 1590 and 1665  almost 100 000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland  Zeeland  and Friesland  However  land reclamation decreased significantly after the middle of the seventeenth century because the price of agricultural products began to fall  making land reclamation far less profitable in the second part of the century

Dutch agriculture was finally affected by the general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last two decades of the seventeenth century  However  what is astonishing about this is not that Dutch agriculture was affected by critical phenomena such as a decrease in sales and production  but the fact that the crisis appeared only relatively late in Dutch agriculture  In Europe as a whole  the exceptional reduction in the population and the related fall in demand for grain since the beginning of the seventeenth century had caused the price of agricultural products to fall  Dutch peasants were able to remain unaffected by this crisis for a long time because they had specialized in dairy farming industrial crops  and horticulture  However  toward the end of the seventeenth century  they too were overtaken by the general agricultural crisis
