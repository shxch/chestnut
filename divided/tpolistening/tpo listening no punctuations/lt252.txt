One consequence of global warming is extinction  There s compelling evidence that global warming will be a significant driver of many plant and animal extinctions in this century  So we are considering various strategies to help some threatened species survive this unprecedented  this warming trend which  as you know  is caused mainly by greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels
Um    the most radical strategy being debated among conservation biologists is Assisted Migration  Assisted migration means picking up members of a species  or members of a group of interdependent species and physically moving or translocating them  Um    translocating threatened species to a cooler place  to higher latitudes or higher elevations  for example
Now  migration is a natural survival strategy  Over the past two million years  colder glacial periods have alternated with warmer interglacial periods  And so  um  in response to these gradual climatic swings  some species have shifted their ranges hundreds of kilometers
So perhaps you are wondering why not let nature take its course now  Well  we can t  The main problem is today s fragmented habitats  During previous interglacial periods  when glaciers retreated  they left behind open land in their wakes  Today human development has paved over much of the natural world  Ecosystems are fragmented  Housing developments  highways and cities have replaced or sliced through forests and prairies  There are a few quarters left for species to migrate through without help  So conservationists are trying to save as many species as possible
Now  assisted migration could become a viable part of our rescue strategy  but there are a number of uncertainties and risks  Without more research  we can t predict if Assisted Migration will work for any given species  A translocated species could die out from lack of food  for example  At the other extreme  we might successfully translocate the species  but within five or ten years that species could proliferate and become an invasive species  Like a non native plant that chokes out native plants by hogging the nutrients in the soil  Translocated animals can become invasive too  It happened in Australia  The cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying Australia s sugarcane plantations  But the cane toad itself became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent
Also  many species are interdependent  intimately connected to one another  Like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relies on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil and on a certain insect for pollination  We probably have to translocate entire networks of species and it s hard to know where to draw the line
And in addition to all that  it is not even clear that assisted migration or any migration for that matter  will help at least for some species  Earth was already in one of its warm interglacial periods when we started burning fossil fuels  And in the twenty first century  global temperatures are expected to rise two to six degrees  That rate of heating is far greater than during the last glacial retreat some 12 000 years ago
Um     whether to use Assisted Migration  this debate is mostly within the biology community right now  But the ultimate decision makers  in the United States at least  will be the government agencies that manage natural resources  Assisted Migration really needs this level of oversight  and soon  Currently there s no public policy on using assisted migration to help species survive climate change  People aren t even required to seek permits to move plants or invertebrate animals around as long as they are not classified as pests  In one case  a group of conservationists has already taken it upon itself to try on their own to save an endangered tree  the Florida Torreya tree  through Assisted Migration
There s only about a thousand individual Florida Torrey as left  And global warming is expected to significantly reduce or eliminate this tree s habitat  So this conservation group wants to translocate seedlings  Florida Torreya seedlings  500 kilometers north in order to expand the species  range  The group believed its effort is justified  but I and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out  because like I said  there could be unintended consequences
