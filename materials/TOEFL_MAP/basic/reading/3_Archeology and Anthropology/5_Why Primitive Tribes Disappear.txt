Why Primitive Tribes Disappear 

During the course of history, many tribes of primitive people have disappeared. On occasion, they left evidence of why they died out. But, most of the time, they just vanished. There are three primary reasons why these tribes died. They are disease, defeat in war, and natural disasters. 

Diseases have killed countless people around the world. One of the most tragic incidents took place in the New World. In the 1500s, European explorers started to visit the Americas. But the Europeans often carried deadly diseases with them. The Native Americans had no immunities to these illnesses. This made them get sick easily. As a result, some diseases infected millions of people. Most of them died. Entire tribes of people were sometimes wiped out. 

Humans have long fought wars against one another. In many cases, when one group of people fought another, the winner simply killed all of the members of the losing tribe. But other groups acted in a different way. Some Native American tribes tried to capture the losers. The winners forced these captives to join their own tribes. So the losing tribes ceased to exist as unique cultures. 

Famines, droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis are all natural disasters. In modern times, they can kill large numbers of people. In ancient times, they were able to destroy some cultures. The Anasazi, a tribe in North America, may have died from a famine. It took place due to a long-lasting drought. In ancient Crete, the Minoan civilization may have ended when a tsunami hit it. A huge wave could have been caused by an erupting volcano. Other civilizations suffered similar fates. Most of the time, there were no written records of them. So those cultures vanished forever.
