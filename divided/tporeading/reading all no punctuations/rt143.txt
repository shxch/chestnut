Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia

Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which economic activity is based primarily on livestock  Archaeological evidence suggests that by 3000 B C   and perhaps even earlier  there had emerged on the steppes of Inner Eurasia the distinctive types of pastoralism that were to dominate the region s history for several millennia  Here  the horse was already becoming the animal of prestige in many regions  though sheep  goats  and cattle could also play a vital role  It is the use of horses for transportation and warfare that explains why Inner Eurasian pastoralism proved the most mobile and the most militaristic of all major forms of pastoralism  The emergence and spread of pastoralism had a profound impact on the history of Inner Eurasia  and also  indirectly  on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area  In particular  pastoralism favors a mobile lifestyle  and this mobility helps to explain the impact of pastoralist societies on this part of the world

The mobility of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal based foods  While agriculturalists rely on domesticated plants  pastoralists rely on domesticated animals  As a result  pastoralists  like carnivores in general  occupy a higher position on the food chain  All else being equal  this means they must exploit larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to secure the same amount of food  clothing  and other necessities  So pastoralism is a more extensive lifeway than farming is  However  the larger the terrain used to support a group  the harder it is to exploit that terrain while remaining in one place  So  basic ecological principles imply a strong tendency within pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism  a mobile lifestyle   As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it   The greater the degree of pastoralism  the stronger the tendency toward nomadism   A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented   The more animals you have  the farther you have to move

Nomadism has further consequences  It means that pastoralist societies occupy and can influence very large territories  This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the Inner Eurasian steppes  for this was the most mobile of all major forms of pastoralism  So  it is no accident that with the appearance of pastoralist societies there appear large areas that share similar cultural  ecological  and even linguistic features  By the late fourth millennium B C   there is already evidence of large culture zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia  Perhaps the most striking sign of mobility is the fact that by the third millennium B C   most pastoralists in this huge region spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo European languages  The remarkable mobility and range of pastoral societies explain  in part  why so many linguists have argued that the Indo European languages began their astonishing expansionist career not among farmers in Anatolia  present day Turkey   but among early pastoralists from Inner Eurasia  Such theories imply that the Indo European languages evolved not in Neolithic  10 000 to 3 000 B C   Anatolia  but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers  which took up stock breeding and began to exploit the neighboring steppes

Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability  If you are constantly on the move  you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses  Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households  though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry   So  by and large  nomadism implies a high degree of self sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor  Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist  and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies  but except in periods of military conquest  they are normally too slight to generate the stable  hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class  Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies  but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities  and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men  including  often  their military skills

2  According to paragraph 1  what made it possible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism to become the most mobile and militaristic form of pastoralism
 It involved the domestication of several types of animals

 It could be adapted to a wide variety of environments

4  In paragraph 2  why does the author contrast pastoralists with agriculturalists
 To explain why pastoralism requires more land than agriculturalism to support basic needs
 To identify some advantages that mobile societies have over immobile societies
 To demonstrate that ecological principles that apply to pastoralism do not apply to agriculturalism
 To argue that agriculturalism eventually developed out of pastoralism

5  According to paragraph 2  pastoralists tend to
 prefer grazing their animals on agricultural lands
 consume comparatively large amounts of food and clothing
 avoid eating plant foods
 move from place to place frequently

6  In paragraph 3  why does the author discuss languages spoken in the region spanning from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia
 To emphasize the frequency with which Indo European languages changed as a result of the mobile nature of pastoralism
 To indicate one method linguists use to determine that inhabitants of the Don and Dnieper river area had taken up stock breeding
 To provide evidence that Indo European languages have their roots in what is now Turkey
 To provide evidence that pastoralist societies can exercise cultural influence over a large area

 reliable
 noticeable
 convincing
 violent

8  The word  exploit  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 use to advantage

 travel across


















9  According to paragraph 4  the fact that pastoralist communities are subject to  strict rules of portability  encourages such communities to
 relocate less frequently than they would otherwise
 have households that are more or less equal in wealth
 become self sufficient in the manufacture of silk and jewelry
 share large material surpluses with neighboring communities


10  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are true of social inequality in pastoralist societies EXCEPT
 It exists and has existed to some degree in most pastoral societies
 It is most marked during periods of military conquest
 It is expressed in the form of a rigid hierarchy based largely on heredity
 It is usually too insignificant to be discussed in terms of class differences


11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Despite the fact that wealth is relatively evenly distributed in pastoral societies  gender inequality still exists because only men can acquire military skills and social status
 Inequalities of gender existed in pastoralist societies until most communities began to require women to possess the same skills as men and take part in the military
 Inequalities of gender in pastoralist societies were caused by steep hierarchies of wealth and differences in military training between men and women
 In pastoral societies  gender inequality is comparatively mild because wealth is relatively evenly distributed and women have to learn most of the same skills that men do

Answer Choices

 The domesticated horse is primarily responsible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism s success in mobility and warfare
 As pastoralists traveled across large areas of terrain with their domesticated animals  they traded valuable material goods such as silks and jewelry
 Because pastoralists are highly mobile  they tend to have few material possessions and can influence the culture  ecology  and language of very large areas
 Because pastoralism requires a great deal of land to support its animal based lifeway  pastoralists must continually relocate and have comparatively egalitarian societies
 Most scholars now believe that Indo European languages probably evolved during the Neolithic period in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers
 Pastoralist communities do not have social classes in the usual sense because they value spiritual attainment over material wealth
