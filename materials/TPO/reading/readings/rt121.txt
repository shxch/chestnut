Which Hand Did They Use

We all know that many more people today are right handed than left handed  Can one trace this same pattern far back in prehistory  Much of the evidence about right hand versus left hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere  and in many Ice Age caves in France  Spain  and Tasmania  When a left hand has been stenciled  this implies that the artist was right handed  and vice versa  Even though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth  one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation  One also has to make the assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward a left hand stenciled palm upward might of course look as if it were a right hand  Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas  136 have been identified as left  and only 22 as right  right handedness was therefore heavily predominant
Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon  Most engravings  for example  are best lit from the left  as befits the work of right handed artists  who generally prefer to have the light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving tool or brush  In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something  it is mostly  though not always  in the right hand
Clues to right handedness can also be found by other methods  Right handers tend to have longer  stronger  and more muscular bones on the right side  and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911 noted the La Chapelle aux Saints Neanderthal skeleton had a right upper arm bone that was noticeably stronger than the left  Similar observations have been made on other Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself
Fractures and other cut marks are another source of evidence  Right handed soldiers tend to be wounded on the left  The skeleton of a 40  or 50 year old Nabatean warrior  buried 2 000 years ago in the Negev Desert  Israel  had multiple healed fractures to the skull  the left arm  and the ribs
Tools themselves can be revealing  Long handed Neolithic spoons of yew wood preserved in Alpine villages dating to 3000 B C  have survived  the signs of rubbing on their left side indicate that their users were right handed  The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right  and was therefore tressed by a righthander
Occasionally one can determine whether stone tools were used in the right hand or the left  and it is even possible to assess how far back this feature can be traced  In stone toolmaking experiments  Nick Toth  a right hander  held the core  the stone that would become the tool  in his left hand and the hammer stone in his right  As the tool was made  the core was rotated clockwise  and the flakes  removed in sequence  had a little crescent of cortex  the core s outer surface  on the side  Toth s knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the cortex on the right  and 44 percent left oriented flakes  A left handed toolmaker would produce the opposite pattern  Toth has applied these criteria to the similarly made pebble tools from a number of early sites  before 1 5 million years  at Koobi Fora  Kenya  probably made by Homo habilis  At seven sites he found that 57 percent of the flakes were right oriented  and 43 percent left  a   pattern almost identical to that produced today
About 90 percent of modern humans are right handed  we are the only mammal with a preferential use of one hand  The part of the brain responsible for fine control and movement is located in the left cerebral hemisphere  and the findings above suggest that the human brain was already asymmetrical in its structure and function not long after 2 million years ago  Among Neanderthalers of 70 000–35 000 years ago  Marcellin Boule noted that the La Chapelle aux Saints individual had a left hemisphere slightly bigger than the right  and the same was found for brains of specimens from Neanderthal  Gibraltar  and La Quina



1  The phrase  assisted in  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 initiated
 dominated
 helped with
 setup

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that even when paint was sprayed by mouth to make a hand stencil
 there was no way to tell which hand was stenciled
 the stenciled hand was the weaker hand
 the stenciled hand was the dominant hand
 artists stenciled more images of the dominant hand than they did of the weak



3  The phrase  depicted  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 identified
 revealed
 pictured
 	imagined

4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the      passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 	Right handed artists could more easily have avoided casting shadows on their work  because engravings in        prehistoric caves were lit from the left
 	The tips of engraving tools and brushes indicate that these instruments were used by right handed artists whose work was lit from the left
 	The best lighting for most engravings suggests that they were made by right handed people trying to avoid the shadow of their hands interfering with their work
 Right handed artists try to avoid having the brush they are using interfere with the light source



5．All of the following are mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 as evidence of right handedness in art and artists EXCEPT
 the ideal source of lighting for most engravings
 the fact that a left hand stenciled palm upward might look like a right hand
 the prevalence of outlines of left hands
 figures in prehistoric art holding objects with the right hand



6  According to paragraph 3  the La Chapelle aux Saints Neanderthal skeleton can be identified as right handed because
 other Neanderthal skeletons found nearby are also right handed
 the right arm bone is stronger than the left
 it is similar to skeletons of La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal
 the right side of the skeleton shows less evidence of fractures


7  Which of the following statements about fractures and cut marks can be inferred from paragraph 4
 Fractures and cut marks caused by right handed soldiers tend to occur on the right side of the injured party s body
 The right arm sustains more injuries because  as the dominant arm  it is used more actively
 In most people  the left side of the body is more vulnerable to injury since it is not defended effectively by the dominant arm
 Fractures and cut marks on fossil humans probably occurred after death

8  According to paragraph 5  what characteristic of a Neolithic spoon would imply that the spoon s owner was right handed
 The direction of the fibers
 Its long handle
 The yew wood it is carved from
 Wear on its left side
9  In paragraph 5  why does the author mention the Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux
 As an example of an item on which the marks of wear imply that it was used by a right handed person
 Because tressing is an activity that is easier for a right handed person than for a left handed person
 Because the cave of Lascaux is the site where researchers have found several prehistoric tools made for right handed people
 As an example of an item whose construction shows that it was right handed made by a right person
10  The word  criteria  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 standards
 findings
 ideas
 techniques
11  What was the purpose of Toth s toolmaking experiment described in paragraph 6
 To shape tools that could be used by either hand
 To produce replicas of early tools for display in museums
 To imitate the production of pebble tools from early sites
 To determine which hand made the early tools
12  What is the author s primary purpose in paragraph 7
 To illustrate the importance of studying the brain
 To demonstrate that human beings are the only mammal to desire fine control of movement
 To contrast the functions of the two hemispheres of the brain
 To demonstrate that right hand preference has existed for a long time

13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
The stencils of hands found in these shelters and caves allow us to draw conclusions about which hand was dominant
Where would the sentence best fit

14．Directions  An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
Several categories of evidence indicate that people have always been predominantly right handed




Answer Choices

 Stencils of right handed figures are characteristic of cave art in France  Spain  and Tasmania
 Signs on the skeletal remains of prehistoric figures  including arm bone size and injury marks  imply that these are the remains of right handed people
 Instruments such as spoons  ropes  and pebble tools show signs that indicate they were used or constructed by right handed people
 The amount of prehistoric art created by right handed artists indicates that left handed people were in the minority
 Neanderthal skeletons often have longer finger bones in the right hand  which is evidence that the right hand was stronger
 Nick Toth  a modem right handed toolmaker has shown that prehistoric tools were knapped to fit the right hand
