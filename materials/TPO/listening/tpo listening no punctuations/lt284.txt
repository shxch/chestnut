Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a professor


Student
Hi  Sorry  I m late  Professor Blane

Professor
No problem  Jim  So you ve got some questions about your senior thesis requirement

Student
Yeah  I ve got a couple of problems actually  So  the first thing is  you normally write it during the first half of the academic year  Right  In your final year of studies

Professor
Right

Student
But I have my student teaching scheduled for that time  I want to teach high school English after graduation  So I really need to give that my full attention  And I just worry that I won t be able to if I am writing my senior thesis at the same time  I mean  it s supposed to be 35 to 40 pages  That s a serious commitment

Professor
You are right  But it really isn t a problem

Student
Really

Professor
No  A lot of English majors get teacher certification  so we have students like you do their senior thesis after their student teaching  It works out well  because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper  So you ll just enroll in a thesis seminar for the second semester

Student
Well  that s a big relief  But it brings us to my second problem  I d really focus my studies on old and middle English literature  I am even thinking about doing a graduate degree with a concentration in that after I taught for a while  So I was hoping to do my senior thesis on Chaucer  on The Canterbury Tales  because that would obviously be useful if I do go on  But …

Professor
Ah  But Professor Johnson …

Student
Exactly  Professor John is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in France during the second half of the year  So without him around  I am not sure how I could do a senior thesis on The Canterbury Tales  I mean  the focus of his teaching and research is unique around here

Professor
Yes  I understand  It would be difficult to do your paper without professor Johnson around  Hmmm… would you allow me to try to sell you on an alternate plan

Student
Well  you can try  But Chaucer is sort of my hero  if you know what I mean

Professor
Well  I am teaching a course on the literature of the Renaissance in the first half of the year  It ll meet late in the day  so it won t interfere with your teaching  And I haven t offered it in quite a while now  so I doubt you ever studied that period on the college level

Student
No  I haven t

Professor
If you would be interested in taking the course  I d be happy to give you supplemental readings  and I d also be happy to be your advisor for your paper later on

Student
Well  I never looked at that area before  but I have always had an interest in it  So that does have a certain appeal


Professor
Well  if you do decide to go this route  I would make that decision soon and I would use this summer productively  After all  this is not going to be like taking an intro course
