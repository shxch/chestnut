The Development of Steam Power
By the eighteenth century  Britain was experiencing a severe shortage of energy  Because of the growth of population  most of the great forests of medieval Britain had long ago been replaced by fields of grain and hay  Wood was in ever shorter supply  yet it remained tremendously important  It served as the primary source of heat for all homes and industries and as a basic raw material  Processed wood  charcoal  was the fuel that was mixed with iron ore in the blast furnace to produce pig iron  raw iron   The iron industry s appetite for wood was enormous  and by 1740 the British iron industry was stagnating  Vast forests enabled Russia to become the world s leading producer of iron  much of which was exported to Britain  But Russia s potential for growth was limited too  and in a few decades Russia would reach the barrier of inadequate energy that was already holding England back

As this early energy crisis grew worse  Britain looked toward its abundant and widely scattered reserves of coal as an alternative to its vanishing wood  Coal was first used in Britain in the late Middle Ages as a source of heat  By 1640 most homes in London were heated with it  and it also provided heat for making beer  glass  soap  and other products  Coal was not used  however  to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery  It was there that coal s potential wad enormous

As more coal was produced  mines were dug deeper and deeper and were constantly filling with water  Mechanical pumps  usually powered by hundreds of horses waling in circles at the surface  had to be installed  Such power was expensive and bothersome  In an attempt to overcome these disadvantages  Thomas Savery in 1698 and Thomas Newcomen in 1705 invented the first primitive steam engines  Both engines were extremely inefficient  Both burned coal to produce steam  which was then used to operate a pump  However  by the early 1770s  many of the Savery engines and hundreds of the Newcomen engines were operating successfully  though inefficiently  in English and Scottish mines

In the early 1760s  a gifted young Scot named James Watt was drawn to a critical study of the steam engine  Watt was employed at the time by the University of Glasgow as a skilled crafts worker making scientific instruments  In 1763  Watt was called on to repair a Newcomen engine being used in a physics course  After a series of observations  Watt saw that the new comen s waste of energy could be reduced by adding a separate condenser  This splendid invention  patented in 1769  greatly increased the efficiency of the steam engine  The steam engine of Watt and his followers was the technological advance that gave people  at least for a while  unlimited power and allowed the invention and use of all kinds of power equipment


The steam engine was quickly put to use in several industries in Britain  It drained mines and made possible the production of ever more coal to feed steam engines elsewhere  The steam power plant began to replace waterpower in the cotton spinning mills as well as other industries during the 1780s  contributing to a phenomenal rise in industrialization  The British iron industry was radically transformed  The use of powerful  steam driven bellows in blast furnaces helped iron makers switch over rapidly from limited charcoal to unlimited coke  which is made from coal  in the smelting of pig iron  the process of refining impure iron  after 1770 in the 1780s  Henry Cort developed the puddling furnace  which allowed pig iron to be refined in turn with coke  Cort also developed heavy duty  steam powered rolling mills  which were capable of producing finished iron in every shape and form

The economic consequence of these technical innovations in steam power was a great boom in the British iron industry  In 1740 annual British iron production was only 17 000 tons  but by 1844  with the spread of coke smelting and the impact of Cort s inventions  it had increased to 3 000 000 tons  This was a truly amazing expansion  Once scarce and expensive  iron became cheap  basic  and indispensable to the economy

1  What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about Britain s short supply of wood in the eighteenth century
  Wood from Britain s great forests was being exported to other countries for profit
  A growing population had required cutting down forests to increase available land for farming
  Larger families required the construction of larger homes made from wood
  What was left of the great forests after the medieval period was being strictly protected

  Russia reached its maximum production of iron at the same time as Britain
  Russia exported much of its iron production to Britain
  Russia s appetite for iron increased rapidly after 1740
  Russia s energy resources eventually became insufficient and limited the growth of its iron industry

  reliable
  plentiful
  well preserved
  existing


4  Why are  beer  glass  soap  and other products  mentioned in the discussion of Britain s energy
  To help explain why the energy crisis was so severe
  To show that despite the energy crisis and as early as 1640  London homes were advanced and well supplied
  To emphasize that after 1640  British homes required energy for more than heat
  To indicate that coal had been used for the production of certain products before the eighteenth century



5  According to paragraph 3  all of the following are ways in which the Savery and Newcomen engines were similar EXCEPT
  Both became relatively inexpensive after the 1770s
  Both produced steam by burning coal
  Both were used to operate pumps
  Both were very inefficient


6  The word  gifted  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  independent
  talented
  famous
  ambitious

7  According to paragraph 4  what was James Watt s major achievement
  He was able to apply his understanding of physics to invent a variety of scientific instruments and tools for skilled crafts workers
  He taught university physics courses to outstanding students whose observations led to many patented inventions
  He improved the efficiency of Newcomen¡¯s engine by preventing energy from being lost
  He redesigned Newcomen¡¯s engine so that it no longer needed a separate condenser

8  The word  splendid  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  original
  necessary
  magnificent
  popular





9  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 5 as a development that greatly changed the production of iron
  The use of coke in the smelting of pig iron
  The invention of a furnace that used coke to refine iron
  The discovery of a method for increasing the production of charcoal
  The invention of powerful machinery that could shape  form  and finish iron


10  In paragraph 6  why does the author compare British iron production in 1740 with that of 1844
  To contrast the amounts of iron needed in Britain in two different centuries
  To illustrate how easy it was to make money using Cort s invention
  To demonstrate the tremendous growth of the iron industry in Britain
  To demonstrate how inexpensive coal had become

11  The word  indispensable  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  advantageous
  essential
  less costly
  highly stimulating

12  According to the passage  which of the following is true about the development of steam power
  The steam engine s basic technology can be traced back to medieval Britain when steam powered machinery  was being tried in farming activities
  Although Russia and Britain developed steam power technology simultaneously  Britain was first to try it in a large scale industry due to a greater need for iron
  Steam power technology was largely the result of improvements developed to increase the supply of coal as a primary source of energy
  Adaptations to steam engines required for their use in cotton spinning mills led to radical developments in machinery used in the iron industry
