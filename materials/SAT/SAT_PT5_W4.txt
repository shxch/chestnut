Questions 34-44 are based on the following passage.
Investigative Journalism: An Evolving American
Tradition
[1] The recent precipitous decline of print journalism
as a viable profession has exacerbated long-held concerns
about the state of investigative reporting in the United
States. [2] Facing lower print circulation and diminished
advertising revenue, many major newspapers have
reduced or eliminated investigative resources.
[3] Newspapers, the traditional nurturing ground for
investigative journalism, have been hit especially hard by
the widespread availability of free news online. [4] To
survive, investigative journalism must continue to adapt
to the digital age. 34
It is not difficult to understand why
a cash-strapped, understaffed publication might feel
pressure to cut teams of investigative
35 reporter’s—their work is expensive and

investigative journalism involves original, often
long-form reporting on such topics as 37 illegal
activities, street crime, corporate wrongdoing, and

helped keep those in power accountable. The exposure by
Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein of government misconduct in the Watergate
scandal resulted in the resignation of President Richard
Nixon in 1974. More recently, Seymour Hersh, reporting
for the New Yorker in 2004, helped publicize the
mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by US personnel at
Abu Ghraib during the Iraq War. 38 In these and other
cases, exposure from reporters has served as an
important 39 blockade to or scolding of malfeasance.

media 40 could not entail the end of investigative
journalism. 41 Although many newsrooms have
reduced their staff, some still employ investigative
reporters. Nonprofit 42 enterprises such as the
Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project have
begun to fill the void created by staff losses at newspapers
and magazines. Enterprising freelance reporters, newly
funded by nonprofits, make extensive use of social media,
