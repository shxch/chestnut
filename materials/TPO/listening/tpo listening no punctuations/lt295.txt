Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class

Professor
We will be looking at the original settlement of the Americas next  and I ll spend the next few classes talking about the Clovis people and the two big questions archaeologists have about them

The two big questions are  when did the Clovis people arrive in the Americas  And of course  were they the first people in the Western hemisphere  And we ll get to that  But for today  let s try to get an idea about  well  a question that s not addressed as much as the others and that s â€“ what was their culture like  And how do we figure that out

Now  again  there s a great debate about when the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas  And I am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back  so let s use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11 000 years ago  The Clovis people were likely settling North America 11 000 years ago  And leave it at that for now



Now  most of what we know about the Clovis people comes from one of their tools the Clovis point  When we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that s worked to a sharp point  in this case probably to be attached to a spear  The Clovis point may be the most analyzed artifact in archaeology  And the point used by Clovis people differs slightly from later points  in the way that the base of the stone is thinned  uh  it s thinner toward the base  the part that s attached to the spear  So when one is found  it s usually not confused with points made by later groups

Clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites  which you might expect  But another fascinating place we find them is in Clovis caches  A cache is just something stored or hidden away  It s also the term for the place where it s hidden

The Clovis caches are collections of tools  stone points and other tools made of stone or bone  often at various stages of manufacturing  some were left unfinished  The traditional explanation is that these were emergency supplies  uh  meant to be used at a later time  Since the Clovis people were highly mobile  it s plausible that they would set up spots along established travel routes where they keep a variety of items  Either so that they wouldn t have to carry everything with them or so they could save time once they arrived at a site by not having to make stuff from scratch

But there s another theory about the caches based on the quality of some of the points we ve found  You see  the points in some caches differ from other points  from points at Clovis camp sites for example  For one thing  these cache points are quite large  up to twice as large as regular points  so big that you couldn t attach one to a spear say  and expect to throw the spear accurately over any distance  So what were they for

Well  it was originally thought that they were unfinished  that someone was working away a point  then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later  The problem is  it s unlikely that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches  that would be a lot of stone to chip away  A toolmaker starts with a smaller piece  And actually  far from being unfinished  a lot of these points really show excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail  And not just with respect to the skill  but also with respect to the raw material  it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone

So we have to ask could these points have served another purpose  Maybe be they weren t just tools  Look at it this way  When the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas  they had a lot to learn about their new environment  Over time  they would have begun to recognize some places as special  important for some reason  Maybe there was always water available there  Or the hunting was especially good  So maybe the cache was a way to mark the place as significant
