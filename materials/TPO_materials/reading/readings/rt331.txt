The First Civilizations
      Evidence suggests that an important stimulus behind the rise of early civilizations was the development of settled agriculture  which unleashed a series of changes in the organization of human communities that culminated in the rise of large ancient empires
The exact time and place that crops were first cultivated successfully is uncertain  Many prehistorians believe that farming may have emerged in dependently in several different areas of the world when small communities  driven by increasing population and a decline in available food resources  began to plant seeds in the ground in an effort to guarantee their survival  The first farmers  who may have lived as long as 10 000 years ago  undoubtedly used simple techniques and still relied primarily on other forms of food production  such as hunting  foraging  or pastoralism  The real breakthrough took place when farmers began to cultivate crops along the floodplains of river systems  The advantage was that crops grown in such areas were not as dependent on rainfall and therefore produced a more reliable harvest  An additional benefit was that the sediment carried by the river waters deposited nutrients in the soil  thus enabling the farmer to cultivate a single plot of ground for many years without moving to a new location  Thus  the first truly sedentary  that is  nonmigratory  societies were born  As time went on  such communities gradually learned how to direct the flow of water to enhance the productive capacity of the land  while the introduction of the iron plow eventually led to the cultivation of heavy soils not previously susceptible to agriculture

      The spread of this river valley agriculture in various parts of Asia and Africa was the decisive factor in the rise of the first civilizations  The increase in food production in these regions led to a significant growth in population  while efforts to control the flow of water to maximize the irrigation of cultivated areas and to protect the local inhabitants from hostile forces outside the community provoked the first steps toward cooperative activities on a large scale  The need to oversee the entire process brought about the emergence of an elite that was eventually transformed into a government

      The first clear steps in the rise of the first civilizations took place in the fourth and third millennia B C  in Mesopotamia  northern Africa  India  and China  How the first governments took shape in these areas is not certain  but anthropologists studying the evolution of human communities in various parts of the world have discovered that one common stage in the process is the emergence of what are called  big men  within a single village or a collection of villages  By means of their military prowess  dominant personalities  or political talents  these people gradually emerge as the leaders of that community  In time  the  big men  become formal symbols of authority and pass on that authority to others within their own family  As the communities continue to grow in size and material wealth  the  big men  assume hereditary status  and their allies and family members are transformed into a hereditary monarchy

      The appearance of these sedentary societies had a major impact on the social organizations  religious beliefs  and way of life of the peoples living within their boundaries  With the increase in population and the development of centralized authority came the emergence of the cities  While some of these urban centers were identified with a particular economic function  such as proximity to gold or iron deposits or a strategic location on a major trade route  others served primarily as administrative centers or the site of temples for the official cult or other ritual observances  Within these cities  new forms of livelihood appeared to satisfy the growing need for social services and consumer goods  Some people became artisans or merchants  while others became warriors  scholars  or priests  In some cases  the physical division within the first cities reflected the strict hierarchical character of the society as a whole  with a royal palace surrounded by an imposing wall and separate from the remainder of the urban population  In other instances  such as the Indus River Valley  the cities lacked a royal precinct and the ostentatious palaces that marked their contemporaries elsewhere

The practice of settled agriculture in some areas of Asia and Africa was crucial to the development of early civilizations





Answer Choices
 Prehistorians disagree as to whether early farmers first cultivated crops along floodplains or first tried cultivating crops in less successful environments
 Cultivation in fertile river valleys resulted in predictable harvests  which meant that farmers no longer needed to migrate constantly in search of food
 Because crops could be cultivated more successfully where farmers were not completely dependent on rainfall  hostilities between groups arose over control of the river systems
 The need to organize the effort to ensure the food supply and defend the land led to the formation of elite supervising groups that eventually became the first governments
 Increasingly centralized forms of administration resulted in the emergence of social classes and in the development of cities as trade  administration  or religious centers
  Unlike other early civilizations  those that developed in the Indus River Valley did not have any spectacular palaces or areas for exclusive use by the authorities
