Ways in which animals adapt to their environment are often quite ingenious actually  And as an example of this  let me tell you about a fish  a group of fish known as the Notothenioids  There s over 90 known species of Notothenioids and they inhabit both shallow and very deep waters  mostly around Antarctica  Many are fairly small  though the largest species can weigh up to 150 kilograms
Notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes  which are covered by a thick insulating layer of clear tissue  This tissue protects their eyes from freezing  Remember  the freezing point of ocean water  salt water  is lower than for fresh water  negative 1 9 degree Celsius   1 9°C   So it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean  say  than in a river or lake  So this means that the ocean waters around Antarctica are cold enough to freeze most types of fish  but Notothenioids don t freeze  In fact  they thrive  They account for some 95% of all fish in the southern ocean  the ocean that surrounds Antarctica
So  how unusual is that  To have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean  I mean  think of…say  tropical or temperate marine environments  which have incredibly diverse fish populations  Coral reefs  for example  support over 4000 types of fish  along with sponges  crustaceans  and many other organisms
So  exactly when and how did the Notothenioids come to dominate the southern ocean
Well  around 30 million years ago  the waters around Antarctica were a lot warmer than they are today  Um   at that time  Antarctica was connected to South America  which means that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up the Antarctica waters  Because the water around Antarctica then was relatively warm  it supported many types of fish  And we know this from fossil evidence
But the 90 or so species of Notothenioids that exist today didn t exist at all back then  In fact  only one ancestral Notothenioid species existed  But somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago  two major changes took place
First  what we call a chance mutation  A tiny genetic change occurred in that one Notothenioid species  Its DNA allowed for the production of a special protein  a protein that prevents the fish from freezing  The way this…this anti freeze protein works is  it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish  This binding action prevents the ice crystals from growing larger  And this is what prevents Notothenioids from freezing
Now  at that time  the waters the Notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold  so the protein didn t really make a difference as far as the fish s survival  But this would change  because in the same period of geologic time there was a shift in the earth s continental plates  Continental drift caused Antarctica to move apart from the landmass of South America and to drift into the Southern Polar Region  This resulted in a powerful water current encircling Antarctica  which prevented the Antarctic waters from mixing with warmer water  So the southern ocean  isolated from that warm airflow from the north  cooled down drastically  to the kinds of sub freezing temperatures we associate with it today
Now  most fish species couldn t survive in this frigid environment and they became extinct  But that one Notothenioid species  with its unique ability to produce that anti freeze protein  thrived  It had virtually the entire southern ocean to itself
So  Well  there was little or no competition for food or space  You might think of it as…um…as a…a kind of ecological vacuum  And the Notothenioids exploited fully  The species migrated into different habitats throughout the southern ocean  And its population increased dramatically  with various sub populations migrating into different parts of the ocean  Over time these sub populations in all those different habitats…well  they developed very different physical traits  They adapted to survive in their particular ecological niche  their…their position within a particular ecosystem
We call this type of species diversification within a species adaptive radiation  And what adaptive radiation is is  an evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new species in order to fill multiple ecological niches  So in the case of the Notothenioids  that single species started colonizing empty habitats to such an extent that it evolved into a broad range of new species  the 90 or so Notothenioid species that we have today  So let me switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that s also been very successful  ?
