Questions 23-33 are based on the following passage
and supplementary material.
Environmentalist Otters
It has long been known that the sea otters 23 living
along the West Coast of North America help keep kelp
forests in their habitat healthy and vital. They do this by
feeding on sea urchins and other herbivorous
invertebrates that graze voraciously on kelp. With sea
otters to keep the population of sea urchins in check, kelp
forests can flourish. In fact, 24 two years or less of sea
otters can completely eliminate sea urchins in a coastal
area (see chart).

Without sea otters present, 25 nevertheless, kelp forests
run the danger of becoming barren stretches of coastal
wasteland known as urchin barrens.

A) NO CHANGE
B) even two years or less of sea otter presence can
reduce the sea urchin threat

D) even after sea otters were present for ten years or
more, kelp density was still lower than sea urchin
density

[1] What was less well-known, until recently at least,
was how this relationship among sea otters, sea urchins,
and kelp forests might help fight global warming. [2] The
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has
increased 40 percent 26 . [3] A recent study by two
professors at the University of California, Santa Cruz,
Chris Wilmers and James Estes, 27 suggests, that kelp
forests protected by sea otters can absorb as much as
twelve times the amount of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere as those where sea urchins are allowed to
28 devour the kelp. [4] Like 29 their terrestrial plant
cousins, kelp removes carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, turning it into sugar fuel through
photosynthesis, and releases oxygen back into the air.

At this point, the writer is considering adding the
following information.
since the start of the Industrial Revolution,
resulting in a rise in global temperatures
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Yes, because it establishes the relationship
between the level of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere and global warming.
B) Yes, because it explains the key role sea otters,
sea urchins, and kelp forests play in combating
global warming.
C) No, because it contradicts the claim made in the
previous paragraph that sea otters help keep kelp
forests healthy.
D) No, because it mentions the Industrial
Revolution, blurring the focus of the paragraph.

[5] Scientists knew this but did not recognize 30 how
large a role they played in helping kelp forests to
significantly decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere. [6] Far from making no difference to the
ecosystem, the presence of otters was found to increase
the carbon storage of kelp forests by 4.4 to 8.7 megatons
annually, offsetting the amount of carbon dioxide
emitted by three million to six million passenger cars
each year. 31
Wilmers and Estes caution, however, that 32 having
more otters will not automatically solve the problem of
higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air. But they suggest
that the presence of otters provides a good model of how
carbon can be sequestered, 33 or removed; from the
atmosphere through the management of animal
populations. If ecologists can better understand what
kinds of impacts animals might have on the environment,
Wilmers contends, “there might be opportunities for
win-win conservation scenarios, whereby animal species
are protected or enhanced, and carbon gets sequestered.”
