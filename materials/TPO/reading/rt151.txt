A Warm Blooded Turtle
When it comes to physiology  the leatherback turtle is  in some ways  more like a reptilian whale than a turtle  It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea turtle  and it deals with the chilly waters in a way unique among reptiles
A warm blooded turtle may seem to be a contradiction in terms  Nonetheless  an adult leatherback can maintain a body temperature of between 25 and 26°C  77 79°F  in seawater that is only 8°C  46 4°F   Accomplishing this feat requires adaptations both to generate heat in the turtle s body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters  Leatherbacks apparently do not generate internal heat the way we do  or the way birds do  as a by product of cellular metabolism  A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface  its dark  almost black body color may help it to absorb solar radiation  However  most of its internal heat comes from the action of its muscles
Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways  The first  and simplest  is size  The bigger the animal is  the lower its surface to volume ratio  for every ounce of body mass  there is proportionately less surface through which heat can escape  An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will therefore take longer to cool off  Maintaining a high body temperature through sheer bulk is called gigantothermy  It works for elephants  for whales  and  perhaps  it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs  It apparently works  in a smaller way  for some other sea turtles  Large loggerhead and green turtles can maintain their body temperature at a degree or two above that of the surrounding water  and gigantothermy is probably the way they do it  Muscular activity helps  too  and an actively swimming green turtle may be 7°C  12 6°F  warmer than the waters it swims through
Gigantothermy  though  would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters  It is not enough for whales  which supplement it with a thick layer of insulating blubber  fat   Leatherbacks do not have blubber  but they do have a reptilian equivalent  thick  oil saturated skin  with a layer of fibrous  fatty tissue just beneath it  Insulation protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers  Because the flippers are comparatively thin and blade like  they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become chilled  There is not much that the turtle can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic shape of the flipper  The problem is that as blood flows through the turtle s flippers  it risks losing enough heat to lower the animal s central body temperature when it returns  The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle s body  The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the base of its flipper into a countercurrent exchange system
In a countercurrent exchange system  the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels  thus  the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper itself  This is the same arrangement found in an old fashioned steam radiator  in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water courses through them  The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement  gulls have a countercurrent exchange in their legs  That is why a gull can stand on an ice floe without freezing
All this applies  of course  only to an adult leatherback  Hatchlings are simply too small to conserve body heat  even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems  We do not know how old  or how large  a leatherback has to be before it can switch from a cold blooded to a warm blooded mode of life  Leatherbacks reach their immense size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow  Perhaps their rush to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm

 natural to
 different from all other
 quite common among
 familiar to
2  What can be inferred about whales from paragraph 1
 They are considered by some to be reptiles
 Their bodies are built in a way that helps them manage extremely cold temperatures
 They are distantly related to leatherback turtles
 They can swim farther than leatherback turtles
3  The word  feat  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 remarkable achievement
 common transformation
 daily activity
 complex solution
4  Paragraph 2 mentions all of the following as true about the body heat of adult leatherback turtles EXCEPT
 Their muscles produce heat for maintaining body temperature
 Their dark bodies help trap solar radiation
 Their cellular metabolism produces heat as a by product
 Basking at the water s surface helps them obtain heat

5  The word  bulk  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 strength
 effort
 activity
 mass








6  The word  it  in paragraph 4 refers to
 the problem
 blood
 the turtle
 body temperature


7  According to paragraph 4  which of the following features enables the leatherback turtle to stay warm
 An insulating layer of blubber
 A thick  oily skin covering fatty tissue
 The aerodynamic shape of its flippers
 A well insulated head

























8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 In a turtle s countercurrent exchange system  outgoing vessels lie near enough to ingoing ones that heat can be exchanged from the former to the latter before reaching the turtle s flippers
 Within the turtle s flippers  there is a countercurrent exchange system that allows colder blood vessels to absorb heat from nearby warmer blood vessels and then return warmed blood to the turtle s body
 In a countercurrent exchange system  a turtle can pick up body heat from being close enough to other turtles  thus raising its blood temperature as it passes them
 When a turtle places its flippers close to its body  it is able to use its countercurrent exchange system to transfer heat from the warmer blood vessels in its body to the cooler blood vessels in its flippers

9  Why does the author mention old fashioned steam radiator in the discussion of countercurrent exchange systems
 To argue that a turtle s central heating system is not as highly evolved as that of other warmblooded animals
 To provide a useful comparison with which to illustrate how a countercurrent exchange system works
 To suggest that steam radiators were modeled after the sophisticated heating system of turtles
 To establish the importance of the movement of water in countercurrent exchange systems

10  The phrase  courses through  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 rises through
 heats up in
 runs through
 collects in



11  According to paragraph 6  which of the following statements is most accurate about young leatherback turtles
 They lack the countercurrent exchange systems that develop in adulthood
 Their rate of growth is slower than that of other sea turtles
 They lose heat easily even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems
 They switch between cold blooded and warm blooded modes throughout their hatchling stage

However  these animals have additional means of staying warm
Where would the sentence best fit

Contrary to what we would expect of reptiles  the leatherback turtle is actually warm blooded




Answer Choices

 Even though they swim into cold ocean waters  leatherbacks maintain their body heat in much the same way as sea turtles in warm southern oceans do
 The leatherback turtle uses a countercurrent exchange system in order to keep the flippers from drawing heat away from the rest of the body
 The shape of the leatherback turtle s flippers is especially important in maintaining heat in extremely cold northern waters
 The leatherback turtle is able to maintain body heat through sheer size
 Leatherbacks have an insulating layer that can be considered the reptilian version of blubber
 Young leatherbacks often do not survive to adulthood because they are not able to switch from a cold blooded way of life to a warm blooded one quickly enough
