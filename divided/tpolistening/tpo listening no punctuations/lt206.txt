TPO20 Lecture4 Biology Snowshoe Hare

Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor

Now  James  you said you had been to the State of Maine  right
Student
Yeah  actually I lived in western Maine until I was about sixteen

Professor

Great  So why don t you tell everybody what is like there in the winter
Student
The winter  Well  it s cold  And there s lots of snow  you wouldn t believe how much snow we
used to get

Professor

Actually I would  I did field research up there a couple of winters  And it really is an incredible environment  And to survive in that sort of environment  animals have to adapt  to evolve in response to their surroundings  As you recall  an adaptation is any feature  um    physical or behavioral feature of a species that helps it survive and reproduce  And in adapting to extreme climates  like Maine in the winter time  animals can evolve in pretty interesting ways  Take  for example  the snowshoe hare

Ok  the snowshoe hare  and of course  that s H A R E  like a rabbit  Although I probably should mention that technically a hare is not exactly the same as a rabbit  even though it is very similar   The primary difference is that a rabbit s young are born blind and without fur   while a hare s babies are born with a full coat and able to see

Now  the snowshoe hare  tell me  what sort of adaptations do you think it has developed that help it survive the Maine winters  I ll give you a hint  Food isn t an issue  The hare actually has abundant food in the small twigs it finds

Student
Well  I don t know  I mean  I know we used to try to look for these rabbits  eh    hares  when we went hiking in the winter   but it was often hard to find them in the snow

Professor

Yes  That s exactly right  The major concern of the snowshoe hare in the winter is predators  And now that includes humans  So one of its adaptations is basically camouflage  In other words  its coat  its fur   turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter   which makes it harder for the hare s predators to see it against the white snow

Student

Yeah  but I could swear I remembered seeing rabbits in the snow a couple of times  I means hares  that were brown

Professor

Well  you may very well have  Timing is really important  but the snowshoe hare doesn t always get it exactly right  Its chances for survival are best if it turns white about the time of the first snowfall  And it s the amount of daylight that triggers the changing of the hare s coat  As the days get shorter   that is  as the Sun is up for a shorter and shorter time each day  the snowshoe hare starts growing white fur and shedding its brown fur   The hare does a pretty good job with its timing  but sometimes when there s a really early or late snow  it stands out  Plus  it takes about a month for the snowshoe hare s coat to completely change color   So if there s a particularly early snowfall  it s very likely that the hare s fur would not yet be totally white  And that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare

OK  What else  Other adaptations  Susan
Student
Well  it s called the snowshoe hare  so are its feet somehow protect it from the cold

Professor

Well  this animal s name does have to do with an adaptation of its feet  Uh    though  not like it has warm furry boots or something to keep its feet from getting cold  You ve probably never needed to wear snowshoes  But  well  snowshoes are not like thick furry shoes designed to keep the feet warm  they are actually quite thin  but very wide  What they do is spread out the weight of the foot coming down on the snow  See  the problem with walking on snow is that you sink in with every step  But with snowshoes  you don t sink in  you walk on top of the snow  It makes walking through the Maine countryside in the winter much easier

Anyway  the snowshoe hare has an adaptation that plays on the same idea  It has hind feet that act like snowshoes  I mean  it s paws are wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow  And this is a huge advantage for the snowshoe hare since by contrast  the feet of its predators usually sink right down into the snow


Now  another advantage related to this is that unlike many animals in winter  snowshoe hares can stay lean and light weight  They accumulate essentially no body fat  Can anyone guess why this is so

Student

They don t eat very much
Professor
Well  yes  But not because there isn t enough food around  It s because  like I said  food is almost always within reach  and they don t have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winters
