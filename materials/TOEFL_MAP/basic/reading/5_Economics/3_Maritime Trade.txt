Maritime Trade

People have always transported goods by land and water. But, in the past, moving goods on land was slow. Despite having pack animals and wagons, people could only carry a limited amount of goods to trade with others.

Moving goods by water was much faster. This was true even when water transportation consisted of simple rafts that floated across lakes. As human civilization developed, ship technology improved. First, people built ships that could sail up and down rivers. Later, they made ships that could sail on seas and oceans. These ships, however, usually stayed in sight of land. In many places, maritime trade flourished. This happened on the Mediterranean Sea. The Phoenicians, Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans sailed all around the Mediterranean thousands of years ago.  Centuries later, ships that could traverse entire oceans were built.  These enabled even more extensive waterborne trade to take place.
