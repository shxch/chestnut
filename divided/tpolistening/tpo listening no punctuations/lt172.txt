TPO 17 Lecture 1 Art History Prehistoric Art Dating

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class

Professor
Good morning  ready to continue our review of prehistoric art  Today  we will be covering the Upper Paleolithic Period  which I am roughly defining as the period from 35 000 to 8 000 BC  A lot of those cave drawings you have all seen come from this period  But we are also be talking about portable works of art  things that could be carried around from place to place  Here is one example  This sculpture is called the Lady with the Hood1   and it was carved from ivory  probably a mammoth s tusk  Its age is a bit of a mystery  According to one source  it dates from 22 000 BC  But other sources claimed it has been dated closer to 30 000 BC  Amy

Amy
Why don t we know the exact date when this head was made

Professor
That s a fair question  We are talking about prehistory here  So obviously the artists didn t put a signature or a date on anything they did  So how do we know when this figure was carved

Tom
Last semester I took an archaeology class and we spent a lot time on  studying ways to date things  One technique I remember was using the location of an object to date it  like how deep it was buried

Professor
That would be Stratigraphy  Stratigraphy is used for dating portable art  When archaeologists are digging at a site  they make very careful notes about which stratum strata   which layer of earth they find things in  And  you know  the general rule is that the oldest layers are at the lowest level  But this only works if the site hasn t been touched  and the layers are intact  A problem with this dating method is that an object could have been carried around  used for several generations before it was discarded  So it might be much older than the layer or even the site where it was found  The stratification technique gives us the minimum age of an object  which isn t necessarily its true age  Tom  in your archaeology class  did you talk about radiocarbon dating

Tom
Yeah  we did  That had to do with chemical analysis  something to do with measuring the amount of radiocarbon that s left in organic stuff  Because we know how fast radiocarbon decays  we can figure out the age of the organic material

Professor
The key word there is organic  Is art made of organic material

Tom
Well  you said the lady with the hood was carved out of ivory  That  s organic

Professor
Absolutely  Any other examples

Amy
Well  when they did those cave drawings  Didn t they use  like charcoal or maybe
colors  dyes made from plants

Professor
Fortunately  they did  at least some of the time  So it turns out that radiocarbon
dating works for a lot of prehistoric art  But again there s a problem  This technique destroys what it analyzes  so you have to chip off bits of the object for testing  Obviously we are reluctant to do that in some cases  And apart from that  there s another problems  The date tells you the age of the material  say  a bone or a tree  the object is made from  but not the date when the artist actually created it  So  with radiocarbon dating  we get the maximum possible age for the object  but it could be younger
Ok  let  s say our scientific analysis has produced an age range  Can we narrow it


down

Amy
Could we look for similar styles or motives  You know  try to find things common to one time period

Professor
We do that all the time  And when we see similarities in pieces of art  we assume some connection in time or place  But is it possible that we could be imposing our own values on that analysis

Tom
I am sorry  I don t get your point

Professor
Well  we have all kinds of pre conceived ideas about how artistic styles develop  For example  a lot of people think the presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more sophisticated artist  While a lack of detail suggests a primitive style  But trends in art in the last century or so certainly challenge that idea  Don t get me wrong though  analyzing the styles of prehistoric art can help dating them  But we need to be careful with the idea that artistic development occurs in a straight line  from simple to complex representations

Amy
What you are saying is  I mean  I get the feeling that this is like a legal process  like building a legal case  the more pieces of evidence we have  the closer we get to the truth

Professor
Great analogy  And now you can see why we don t have an exact date for our sculpture  the lady with the hood
