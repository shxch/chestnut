Predators and Prey

All ecosystems have predators and prey animals. Predators are hunters. They catch and eat prey animals. A lion hunting, killing, and eating a zebra is one example of a predator-prey relationship. These relationships are crucial in all ecosystems. They play a role in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem. If either predators or prey become too numerous, problems can arise.

Prey animals usually eat plants. Predators, however, eat prey animals. The number of predators in an area is almost always much less than the number of prey animals in the same region. An area can only support a certain number of predators. For instance, wolves often live in small packs of less than ten members. They mark the territory in which they live and hunt. Their area often has many deer and other small mammals. These prey animals support the local wolf population. The wolves are also territorial. They attack any other wolf that enters their land.

Sometimes, the balance between predators and prey gets upset. There may suddenly be too many predators and not enough prey for them to eat. There are normally two results. Some of the predators may die. Or they may move to a different area. A few species of predators actually regulate their numbers. Wolves do this by not breeding. Some male wolves simply do not mate. This ensures that the entire pack has ample food. At other times, a region may have too many prey animals. This happens when there are few or no predators. Prey animals tend to reproduce quickly. So the animals might eat all of the vegetation in an area. This can upset the balance of an ecosystem. This has happened in Australia. The rabbit population has grown out of control since the rabbits have no natural enemies there.
