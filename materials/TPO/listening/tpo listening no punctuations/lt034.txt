TPO 3 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor

Student
Hi  Professor Archer  you know how in class last week you said that you were looking for students who are interested in volunteering for your archeology project

Professor
Of course  are you volunteering

Student
Yes  I am  It sounds really interesting  but um… do I need to have any experience for these kinds of projects

Professor
No  not really  I assume that most students taking the introductory level class would have little or no experience with archeological research  but that s ok

Student
Oh  good  that s a relief  Actually  that s why I m volunteering for the project   to get experience  What kind of work is it

Professor
Well  as you know  we re studying the history of the campus this semester  This used to be an agricultural area and we already know that where the main lecture hall now stands  there once were farm house and barn that were erected in the late 1700s  We are excavating near the lecture hall to see what types of artifacts we find  you know  things people used in the past that got buried when the campus was constructed  We ve already begun to find some very interesting items  like old bottles  buttons  pieces of clay pottery

Student
Buttons and clay pottery  Did the old owners leave in such a hurry that they left their clothes and dishes behind

Professor
Hmmm… that s just one of the questions we hope to answer with this project

Student
Wow  and it s all right here on campus

Professor
That s right  no traveling involved  I wouldn t expect volunteers to travel to a site  especially in the middle of the semester  We expect to find many more things  but we do need more people to help

Student
So… how many student volunteers are you looking for

Professor
I m hoping to get five or six  I ve asked for volunteers in all of the classes I teach  but no one has responded  You are the first person to express interest

Student
Sounds like it could be a lot of work  Is there um… is there any way I can use the experience to get some extra credit in class  I mean  can I write a paper about it

Professor
I think it ll depend on what type of work you do in the excavation  but I imagine we can arrange something  Actually I ve been considering offering extra credit for class because I ve been having a tough time getting volunteers  Extra credit is always a good incentive for students

Student
And how often would you want the volunteers to work

Professor
We re asking for three or four hours per week  depending on your schedule  A senior researcher  I think you know John Franklin  my assistant  is on site every day

Student
Sure  I know John  By the way  will there be some sort of training

Professor
Yes  er… I want to wait till Friday to see how many students volunteer  and then I ll schedule a training class next week at a time that s convenient for everyone

Student
Ok  I ll wait to hear from you  Thanks a lot for accepting me
