Spartina

Spartina alterniflora  known as cordgrass  is a deciduous  perennial flowering plant native to the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast of the United States  It is the dominant native species of the lower salt marshes along these coasts  where it grows in the intertidal zone  the area covered by water some parts of the day and exposed others
These natural salt marshes are among the most productive habitats in the marine environment  Nutrient rich water is brought to the wetlands during each high tide  making a high rate of food production possible  As the seaweed and marsh grass leaves die  bacteria break down the plant material  and insects  small shrimplike organisms  fiddler crabs  and marsh snails eat the decaying plant tissue  digest it  and excrete wastes high in nutrients  Numerous insects occupy the marsh  feeding on living or dead cordgrass tissue  and redwing blackbirds  sparrows  rodents  rabbits  and deer feed directly on the cordgrass  Each tidal cycle carries plant material into the offshore water to be used by the subtidal organisms
Spartina is an exceedingly competitive plant  It spreads primarily by underground stems  colonies form when pieces of the root system or whole plants float into an area and take root or when seeds float into a suitable area and germinate  Spartina establishes itself on substrates ranging from sand and silt to gravel and cobble and is tolerant of salinities ranging from that of near freshwater  0 05 percent  to that of salt water  3 5 percent   Because they lack oxygen  marsh sediments are high in sulfides that are toxic to most plants  Spartina has the ability to take up sulfides and convert them to sulfate  a form of sulfur that the plant can use  this ability makes it easier for the grass to colonize marsh environments  Another adaptive advantage is Spartan s ability to use carbon dioxide more efficiently than most other plants
These characteristics make Spartina a valuable component of the estuaries where it occurs naturally  The plant functions as a stabilizer and a sediment trap and as a nursery area for estuarine fish and shellfish  Once established  a stand of Spartina begins to trap sediment  changing the substrate elevation  and eventually the stand evolves into a high marsh system where Spartina is gradually displaced by higher elevation  brackish water species  As elevation increases  narrow  deep channels of water from throughout the marsh  Along the east coast Spartina is considered valuable for its ability to prevent erosion and marshland deterioration  it is also used for coastal restoration projects and the creation of new wetland sites
Spartina was transported to Washington State in packing materials for oysters transplanted from the east coast in 1894  Leaving its insect predators behind  the cordgrass has been spreading slowly and steadily along Washington s tidal estuaries on the west coast  crowding out the native plants and drastically altering the landscape by trapping sediment  Spartina modifies tidal mudflats  turning them into high marshes inhospitable to the many fish and waterfowl that depend on the mudflats  It is already hampering the oyster harvest and the Dungeness crab fishery  and it interferes with the recreational use of beaches and waterfronts  Spartina has been transplanted to England and to New Zealand for land reclamation and shoreline stabilization  In New Zealand the plant has spread rapidly  changing mudflats with marshy fringes to extensive salt meadows and reducing the number and kinds of birds and animals that use the marsh
Efforts to control Spartina outside its natural environment have included burning  flooding  shading plants with black canvas or plastic  smothering the plants with dredged materials or clay  applying herbicide  and mowing repeatedly  Little success has been reported in New Zealand and England  Washington State s management program has tried many of these methods and is presently using the herbicide glyphosphate to control its spread  Work has begun to determine the feasibility of using insects as biological controls  but effective biological controls are considered years away  Even with a massive effort  it is doubtful that complete eradication of Spartina from nonnative habitats is possible  for it has become an integral part of these shorelines and estuaries during the last 100 to 200 years


1  According to paragraph 1  each of the following is true of Spartina alrerniflora EXCEPT
 It rarely flowers in salt marshes
 It grows well in intertidal zones
 It is commonly referred to as cordgrass
 It occurs naturally along the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast of the United States


2  According to paragraph 2  a major reason why natural salt marshes are so productive is that they are
 inhabited by long lived seaweed and marsh grasses that reproduce gradually
 kept clear of excess plant material by the tides
 regularly supplied with high levels of nutrients
 home to a wide variety of different species of grasses

3  Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Insects feed only on dead cordgrass  while most other marsh inhabitants feed on live cordgrass
 The marsh is a good habitat for insects  but a relatively poor one for birds and animals
 Although cordgrass provides food for birds and animals  it gives insects both food and a place to live
 Cordgrass provides food for numerous insects  birds  and other animals







4  What is the organizational structure of paragraph 3
 It makes a general claim about Spartina and then provides specific evidence to defend that claim against objections to the claim
 It presents a general characterization of Spartina and then describes particular features on which this characterization is based
 It reports a widely held view about Spartina and then considers evidence both for and against that view
 It presents a general hypothesis about Spartina and then lists specific evidence that disputes that hypothesis
5  The word  exceedingly  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unusually
 dangerously
 surprisingly
 highly
6  According to paragraph 3  one reason that Spartina is able to compete in marsh environments so successfully is its ability to
 alter the substrate in which it grows
 convert sulfides into a usable form of sulfur
 grow and produce seeds while floating on the surface of the water
 produce carbon dioxide with great efficiency


7  Paragraph 4 suggests that where Spartinaoccurs naturally  an established stand of it will eventually
 create conditions in which it can no longer survive
 get washed away by water flowing through the deep channels that form around it
 become adapted to brackish water
 take over other grass species growing in the area
8  According to paragraph 4  in its natural habitats  Spartina helps estuaries by
 controlling marshland decline
 decreasing the substrate elevation
 reducing the brackishness of the water
 increasing the flow of water into the estuary

9  According to paragraph 5  Spartina negatively affects wildlife in estuaries by
 trapping fish and waterfowl in sediment
 preventing oysters from transplanting successfully
 turning mudflats into high marshes and salt meadows
 expanding the marshy fringes of salt meadows

10  The word  modifies  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 creates
 changes
 grows on
 breaks down

11  According to paragraph 6  each of the following methods has been used in attempts to control Spartina EXCEPT
 flooding plants
 cutting plants down repeatedly
 applying herbicides
 introducing predatory insects

12  The word  Efforts  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Laws
 Suggestions
 Attempts
 Failures



13 Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Spartina is particularly able to tolerate high salinities because salt glands on the surface of the leaves remove the salt from the plant sap
Where would the sentence best fit

Answers

 Spartina is very well adapted to conditions in salt marshes  where it plays a valuable role in stabilizing them and making them highly productive marine habitats
 Spartina expands by growing root systems that float on the water s surface and descend underground  where it finds the nutrients that it needs to germinate
 As a result of its spread in Washington State over the past hundred years  Spartina has now become a threat to native oysters by releasing sediments that contain sulfides into the waters
 The dead leaves of Spartina become food for a wide variety of marine organisms
 Outside its native regions  Spartina can pose serious problems by turning mudflats into high marshes that are inhospitable to many native fish and birds
 Spartina has physiological adaptations that allow it to grow in environments where other plants cannot  making it a very strong competitor that is difficult to control once it is established
