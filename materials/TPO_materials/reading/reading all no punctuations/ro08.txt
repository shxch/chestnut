Nineteenth Century Politics in the United States
The development of the modern presidency in the United States began with Andrew Jackson who swept to power in 1829 at the head of the Democratic Party and served until 1837  During his administration  he immeasurably enlarged the power of the presidency   The President is the direct representative of the American people   he lectured the Senate when it opposed him   He was elected by the people  and is responsible to them   With this declaration  Jackson redefined the character of the presidential office and its relationship to the people
During Jackson s second term  his opponents had gradually come together to form the Whig party  Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the market  banks  and commerce  The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing conflict between  the people  farmers  planters  and workers and a set of greedy aristocrats  This  paper money aristocracy  of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit  Democrats claimed  and sapped the nation s virtue by encouraging speculation and the desire for sudden  unearned wealth  The Democrats wanted the rewards of the market without sacrificing the features of a simple agrarian republic  They wanted the wealth that the market offered without the competitive  changing society  the complex dealing  the dominance of urban centers  and the loss of independence that came with it
Whigs  on the other hand  were more comfortable with the market  For them  commerce and economic development were agents of civilization  Nor did the Whigs envision any conflict in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople and bankers on the other  Economic growth would benefit everyone by raising national income and expanding opportunity  The government s responsibility was to provide a well regulated economy that guaranteed opportunity for citizens of ability
Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the market but also about how active the central government should be in people s lives  Despite Andrew Jackson s inclination to be a strong President  Democrats as a rule believed in limited government  Government s role in the economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies  and special privileges  In keeping with this philosophy of limited government  Democrats also rejected the idea that moral beliefs were the proper sphere of government action  Religion and politics  they believed  should be kept clearly separate  and they generally opposed humanitarian legislation
The Whigs  in contrast  viewed government power positively  They believed that it should be used to protect individual rights and public liberty  and that it had a special role where individual effort was ineffective  By regulating the economy and competition  the government could ensure equal opportunity  Indeed  for Whigs the concept of government promoting the general welfare went beyond the economy  In particular  Whigs in the northern sections of the United States also believed that government power should be used to foster the moral welfare of the country  They were much more likely to favor social reform legislation and aid to education
 In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was similar  To be competitive in winning votes  Whigs and Democrats both had to have significant support among farmers  the largest group in society  and workers  Neither party could win an election by appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor  The Whigs  however  enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business and commercial classes  Whigs appealed to planters who needed credit to finance their cotton and rice trade in the world market  to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses  and to workers who wished to improve themselves  Democrats attracted farmers isolated from the market or uncomfortable with it  workers alienated from the emerging industrial system  and rising entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies and open the economy to newcomers like themselves  The Whigs were strongest in the towns  cities  and those rural areas that were fully integrated into the market economy  whereas Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and languishing economically
