TPO 1 Lecture 1 Contemporary art
Listen to part of a lecture in a contemporary art class

Professor
Ok  I m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment  Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it  Well  the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up  It s already started in fact  but it ll be at the gallery for the next month  which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment

The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen  Frantzen s work may be unfamiliar to you since she s a relatively young artist  But she s got a very unusual style  compared to some of the artists we ve looked at this term  But anyway  Frantzen s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism  So you ve probably studied both of these movements separately  separate movements  Realism and Impressionism  in some of your art history courses  So who can just sum these up

Student
Well  Impressionism started in the late 19th century  Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles  It didn t depict scenes or models exactly as they looked  Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly  and in big brushstrokes  so the texture of the canvas was rough

Professor
Good  What else  What were the subjects

Student
Well  a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes  like people on the streets and in cafes  uh  lots of nature scenes  especially landscapes

Professor
Good  So when you go to the exhibit  I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting  It s a farm scene  And you will see it right as you enter the gallery  The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen s style  It s an outdoor scene  an everyday scene  It s kind of bleak  but you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines  The colors aren t quite realistic  The sky is kind of  well an unnatural pinkish yellow  And the fence in the foreground is blue  but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold  bleak winter day on a farm  So that s the impressionist side of her work

Oh  and speaking about farms  that reminds me  One interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad  she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn  And the Sales Barn  it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle  their farm animals  And the reason Frantzen went there  and she later on would visit other places like dance halls  was to observe people and the ways that they moved  She really found that this helped her work   that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions  how humans move  and stand still  what their postures were like  too

So  what about Realism  What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen s work

Student
Um… real honest depictions of subject matter  pretty unidealized stuff  and pretty everyday subject matter  too

Professor
Good  One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins  You will notice that the woman s face is so realistic looking that it s almost like a photograph  The woman s nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up  This is realism  But then  the background of the painting  this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes  and  it s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines  kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close  And there are vibrant colors  There s lots of orange  with little hints of an electric blue peeking out

I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist  I mean  some artists  to appreciate them  you have to know their life story  But here s a little bit about Rose Frantzen s life anyway  She attended art school  but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration  that she should go into advertising instead  So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too  until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good  that she could be an artist  But of course  it s not as easy as that  and so Frantzen had to paint other people s portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more serious art work  No matter what  she never stopped painting  And now  Frantzen is doing extremely well  And her work is being shown all over the country  So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that  But what s important is that you keep at it that you don t give up  That s what is really important to remember
