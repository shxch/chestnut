Public Education

Public education is a system in which students are taught in schools run by the government. It is common all around the world today. But, in the past, few children attended school. Only rich upper-class children received an education. They typically studied with private tutors at their homes. As for lower-class children, they learned basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic from their parents. Tutors were too expensive for them.

This changed in the 1800s. During that century, mass public education began in Europe and North America. The reason for this was the need for educated people. The world was changing. It was no longer based on agriculture. Instead, it was based on industry. Factories and offices needed educated people. So many governments established schools for children. The students studied at these schools for free. This was the beginning of public education.
