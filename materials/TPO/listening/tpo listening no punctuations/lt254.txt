Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor

Student
Well  you know  I am writing that paper about whales and the path they travel as they swim through the ocean  their migration patterns
Professor
Yes  I remember
Student
And well  I was thinking about it and I realized I don t understand how they hold their breath underwater  It s a little crazy for me to be writing about migration patterns without actually knowing how they stay underwater for so long
Professor
Did you do any research to find out how they do it
Student
Yeah  I did  I searched on the internet and there was a lot of information about whales  their habitats  the way they communicate  you know  their songs  But if there was anything about whales and how they hold their breath  I missed it  I ve got a bunch of books  Actually  I have got so much information  it s a little overwhelming
Professor
I am surprised there is nothing about it in any of those books
Student
Well  to be honest  I ve only skimmed them so far  I am still working on finding sources
Professor
OK  I know I encourage everyone in class to look at a substantial number of sources  but I don t want you to get overwhelmed  Looking at a number of sources gives you a good knowledge base  but students only have a limited amount of time to work on each paper  I don t expect you to read a dozen books on whales for this assignment  Focus on just a few
Student
Ok  Thanks
Professor
You know  since you are already here  I can give you a quick summary of how whales hold their breath underwater  It s just a matter of certain adaptations in their anatomies  specifically in their circulatory system
Student
So the blood flow is what makes the difference
Professor
Yes  and in a couple of ways  First  blood makes up a larger share of a whale s weight than in other mammals
Student
So they can store more oxygen because they have more blood
Professor
Yes  but that s only part of it  They also have a greater capacity than land animals to store oxygen in their blood
Student
So how does having more oxygen in their blood help them stay underwater longer
Professor
It s the way the whale s blood carries oxygen to the rest of its body  Whales carefully conserve their oxygen when underwater in a couple of ways  When a whale dives  its metabolic rate drops  causing its heartbeat to slow down  And the blood flow to its muscles and some of its non vital organs  like its kidneys  is also cut off  A whale s muscles and non vital organs are able to function without oxygen for an extended period of time
Student
I see  Well  now I can concentrate on my topic
