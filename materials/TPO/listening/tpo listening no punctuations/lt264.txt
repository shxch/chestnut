Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her biology professor．
Professor
Hi  Jean．How was the…uh  the conference  right  the conference on volunteerism  That s where you were last week．
Student
Yeah  It was great  I met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area．Now it would be a lot easier to get students to volunteer in the community．Plus  I ve never been to any of the beaches here before．Being at the beach was definitely a plus．
Professor
Well  I hope you had time to look over the notes from the class you missed．You did get the notes  right
Student
Yup．I II look them over before tomorrow s class．
Professor
Good．And let me know if you have any questions
Student
Well  there is something that I wanted to ask you now．It s about something I noticed at the beach．
Professor
Oh  what s that
Student
Well  see  there are a lot of jellyfish there  floating in the water
Professor
That couldn t have been pleasant
Student
Not for swimming  But it was interesting  I mean  the jelleyfish were glowing．I swear they were．And I am wondering what that s about．
Professor
Ah  glowing jellyfish．That is interesting  Uh  it s called bioluminescence．And actually we are going to talk about it later in the semester．Basically  bioluminescence is light that s produced by a chemical reaction
Student
Really  Inside the jellyfish
Professor
Well  not all jellyfish  about half of them．Actually  a lot of marine organisms have this ability  especially in deeper parts of the ocean．
Student
Oh  I get it  Like the darker it gets  the more the fish needs light  right
Professor
Well．bioluminescence serves a number of functions．Most aquatic organisms use it for communication and for attracting prey．But jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators．Some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators  to  uh  to startle them．But jellyfish closer to the surface  probably like the jellyfish you saw  they use bioluminescence to hide．The light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight  so they blend in  and  uh  and predators can t see them．
Student
Wow  really  Well  I am looking for a topic for my term paper  so maybe I could do it on these glowing jellyfish．That s why I wanted to ask you about them  you know  to find out if there was really something to write about．
Professor
It s a great topic．But you II have to make sure the topic is manageable．Like I said  about half of all jellyfish are bioluminescent  so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence in the same way  or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence  on  on the chemical process  or…Here s an idea．You seem to be very involved in local issues．See if you
can identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the local ecosystem．
Student
Yeah  you know  some of the environmental groups I met last week might even be able to help me．
