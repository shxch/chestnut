Microecosystems

An ecosystem is an area that supports many organisms. Some can be quite large. They include forests, deserts, and even oceans. Others can be rather small. Scientists call them microecosystems. Examples are a puddle Of water, a section of soil, an underwater thermal vent, and a single tree. Even the internal body of an animal can be considered one. It supports bacteria and other microorganisms. Despite being tiny, microecosystems play vital roles in the lives of many organisms.

A lot of factors can influence microecosystems. They include temperature, water content, chemical composition, salt content, and acid levels.    Taken together, they determine which organisms live in a microecosystem.    But every microecosystem is pan of larger ecosystems.    So any change in an ecosystem can have a great effect on a microecosystem as well.

A microecosystem can be found just about anywhere. Some, such as thermal vents, are deep beneath the ocean. They are created by undersea volcanoes. The vents produce hot water no matter how deep they are. Their warmth attracts numerous underwater life forms. They come together to form their own microecosystem. Many areas around thermal vents are teeming with life.

A tree is another example of a microecosystem. Insects, birds, snakes, and people—among others—may all interact within it. For instance, insects may live in the tree. They get nutrition from eating other insects or from the tree itself. Birds can use the tree for several reasons. They may eat the insects. And they may use the tree's leaves and branches to build their nests. Predators such as snakes may eat the insects and birds in the tree. And humans may harvest the nuts or fruit from the tree. All of these creatures interact with each other in one microecosystem.
