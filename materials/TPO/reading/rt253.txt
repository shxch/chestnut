The evolutionary history of plants has been marked by a series of adaptations  The ancestors of plants were photosynthetic single celled organisms that gave rise to plants presumably lacked true roots  stems  leaves  and complex reproductive structures such as flowers  All of these features appeared later in the evolutionary history of plants  Of today s different groups of algae  green algae are probably the most similar to ancestral plants  This supposition stems from the close phylogenetic  natural evolutionary  relationship between the two groups  DNA comparisons have shown that green algae are plants  closest living relatives  In addition  other lines of evidence support the hypothesis that land plants evolved from ancestral green algae used the same type of chlorophyll and accessory pigments in photosynthesis as do land plants  This would not be true of red and brown algae  Green algae store food as starch  as do land plants and have cell walls made of cellulose  similar in composition to those of land plants  Again  the good storage and cell wall molecules of red and brown algae are different
Today green algae live mainly in freshwater  suggesting that their early evolutionary history may have occurred in freshwater habitats  If so  the green algae would have been subjected to environmental pressures that resulted in adaptations that enhanced their potential to give rise to land dwelling or organisms
The environmental conditions of freshwater habitats  unlike those of ocean habitats  are highly variable  Water temperature can fluctuate seasonally or even daily and changing level of rainfall can lead to fluctuations in the concentration of chemical in the water or even to period in which the aquatic habitat dries up  Ancient fresh water green algae must have evolved features that enable them to withstand extremes of temperature and periods of dryness  These adaptations served their descendant well as they invaded land
The terrestrial world is green now  but it did not start out that way  When plants first made the transition ashore more than 400 million years ago  the land was barren and desolate  inhospitable to life  From a plant s evolutionary view point  however  it was also a land of opportunity  free of competitors and predators and full of carbon dioxide and sunlight  the raw materials for photosynthesis  which are present in far higher concentrations in air than in water  So once natural selection had shaped the adaptations that helped plants overcome the obstacles to terrestrial living  plants prospered and diversified
When plants pioneered the land  they faced a range of challenges posed by terrestrial environments  On land  the supportive buoyancy of water is missing  the plant is no longer bathed in a nutrient solution  and air tends to dry things out  These conditions favored the evolution of the structures that support the body  vessels that transport water and nutrients to all parts of plant  and structures that conserve water  The resulting adaptations to dry land include some structural features that arose early in plant evolution  now these features are common to virtually all land plant  They include roots or root like structures  a waxy cuticle that covers the surfaces of leaves and stems and limits the evaporation of water  and pores called stomata in leaves and stems that allow gas exchange but close when water is scarce  thus reducing water loss  Other adaptations occurred later in the transition to terrestrial life and now wide spread but not universal among plants  These include conducting vessels that transport water and minerals upward from the roots and that move the photosynthetic products from the leaves to the rest of the plant body and the stiffening substance lignin  which support the plant body  helping it expose maximum surface area to sunlight
These adaptations allowed an increasing diversity of plant forms to exploit dry land  Life on land  however  also required new methods of transporting sperm to eggs  Unlike aquatic and marine forms  land plants cannot always rely on water currents to carry their sex cells and disperse their fertilized eggs  So the most successful groups of land plants are those that evolved methods of fertilized sex cell dispersal that are independent of water and structures that protest developing embryos from drying out  Protected embryos and waterless dispersal of sex cells were achieved with the origin of seed plants and the key evolutionary innovations that they introduced  pollen  seeds  and later  flowers and fruits

In moving from water to land  ancestral plants overcame many obstacles in order to survive  Answer choices




Answer choices


 Neither brown nor red algae are likely to be ancestors of plants because of their difference in pigmentation
 The instability of freshwater habitats caused marine algae to develop adaptations to their harsh environment
 The colonization of land by plants was a major revolution in the history of Earth
 Terrestrial plants adjusted to life on land by undergoing structural changes that enabled them to support themselves  resist drying  and exchange gases
 To colonize new terrestrial habitats  plants needed to create a way of reproducing without water
 Once plants had overcome the challenges posed by terrestrial life  they prospered by becoming less diverse
