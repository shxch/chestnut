The Decline of Venetian Shipping
In the late thirteenth century  northern Italian cities such as Genoa  Florence  and Venice began an economic resurgence that made them into the most important economic centers of Europe  By the seventeenth century  however  other European powers had taken over  as the Italian cities lost much of their economic might
This decline can be seen clearly in the changes that affected Venetian shipping and trade  First  Venice s intermediary functions in the Adriatic Sea  where it had dominated the business of shipping for other parties  were lost to direct trading  In the fifteenth century there was little problem recruiting sailors to row the galleys  large ships propelled by oars   guilds  business associations  were required to provide rowers  and through a draft system free citizens served compulsorily when called for  In the early sixteenth century the shortage of rowers was not serious because the demand for galleys was limited by a move to round ships  round hulled ships with more cargo space   with required fewer rowers  But the shortage of crews proved to be a greater and greater problem  despite continuous appeal to Venic s tradition of maritime greatness  Even though sailors  wages doubled among the northern Italian cities from 1550 to 1590  this did not elicit an increased supply
The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale  Venice s huge and powerful shipyard  Timber ran short  and it was necessary to procure it from farther and farther away  In ancient Roman times  the Italian peninsula had great forest of fir preferred for warships  but scarcity was apparent as early as the early fourteenth century  Arsenale officers first brought timber from the foothills of the Alps  then from north toward Trieste  and finally from across the Adriatic  Private shipbuilders were required to buy their oak abroad  As the costs of shipbuilding rose  Venice clung to its outdated standard while the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more easily handled ships
The step from buying foreign timber to buying foreign ships was regarded as a short one  especially when complaints were heard in the latter sixteenth century that the standards and traditions of the Arsenale were running down  Work was stretched out and done poorly  Older workers had been allowed to stop work a half hour before the regular time  and in 1601 younger works left with them  Merchants complained that the privileges reserved for Venetian built and owned ships were first extended to those Venetians who bought ships from abroad and then to foreign built and owned vessels  Historian Frederic Lane observes that after the loss of ships in battle in the late sixteenth century  the shipbuilding industry no longer had the capacity to recover that it had displayed at the start of the century
The conventional explanation for the loss of Venetian dominance in trade is establishment of the Portuguese direct sea route to the East  replacing the overland Silk Road from the Black sea and the highly profitable Indian Ocean caravan eastern Mediterranean route to Venice  The Portuguese Vasco da Gama s Voyage around southern Africa to India took place at the end of the fifteenth century  and by 1502 the trans  Abrabian caravan route had been cut off by political unrest
The Venetian Council finally allowed round ships to enter the trade that was previously reserved for merchant galleys  thus reducing transport cost by one third  Prices of spices delivered by ship from the eastern Mediterranean came to equal those of spices transported by Portuguese vessels  but the increase in quantity with both routes in operation drove the price far down  Gradually  Venice s role as a storage and distribution center for spices and silk  dyes cotton  and gold decayed  and by the early seventeenth century Venice had lost its monopoly in markets such as France and southern Germany
Venetian shipping had started to decline from about 1530 before the entry into the Mediterranean of large volumes of Dutch and British shipping and was clearly outclassed by the end of the century  A contemporary of Shakespeare  1564 1616  observed that the productivity of Italian shipping had declined  compared with that of the British  because of conservatism and loss of expertise  Moreover  Italian sailors were deserting and emigrating  and captains  no longer recruited from the ranks of nobles  were weak on navigations

Answer choices

 Venetian ships were famous for carrying large cargoes of spices and luxury goods around the world in fast  oar driven galleys

 The Venetian Council made sure that Venetian built and –owned ships kept special privileges in transporting luxury goods in and out of Venice
 Venetian round ships bringing spices and silk from the East helped drive prices down so that ordinary people could afford to buy them
 Venice failed to keep up with improvement in ship design  and the cost of shipbuilding rose while quality and efficiency declined
 The Portuguese direct sea route to the East adversely affected Venetian trade  and Venice fell behind the Dutch and the British in the quality of their ships and sailing skills
