Geology and Landscape

Most people consider the landscape to be unchanging  but Earth is a dynamic body  and its surface is continually altering slowly on the human time scale  but relatively rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth  about 4 500 billion years   There are two principal influences that shape the terrain  constructive processes such as uplift  which create new landscape features  and destructive forces such as erosion  which gradually wear away exposed landforms

Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence  successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature  but in fact they tend to be relatively short lived in geological terms  As a general rule  the higher a mountain is  the more recently it was formed  for example  the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old  Lower mountains tend to be older  and are often the eroded relics of much higher mountain chains  About 400 million years ago  when the present day continents of North America and Europe were joined  the Caledonian mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas  Today  however  the relics of the Caledonian orogeny  mountain building period  exist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland  the northern Appalachians in the United States  the Scottish Highlands  and the Norwegian coastal plateau

The Earth s crust is thought to be divided into huge  movable segments  called plates  which float on a soft plastic layer of rock  Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the plate margins  In this process  sedimentary rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26 000 feet  Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes  which fracture the Earth s crust and can displace enough rock to produce Block Mountains  A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of volcanic activity which occurs in regions of active fold mountain belts  such as in the Cascade Range of western North America  The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic materials  Many of the peaks are extinct volcanoes

Whatever the reason for mountain formation  as soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to destructive forces  The exposed rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments  which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments  Thus  any landscape represents only a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of erosion

The weather  in its many forms  is the main agent of erosion  Rain washes away loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks  Carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the rainwater  forming a weak acid  carbonic acid  that may chemically attack the rocks  The rain seeps underground and the water may reappear later as springs  These springs are the sources of streams and rivers  which cut through the rocks and carry away debris from the mountains to the lowlands

Under very cold conditions  rocks can be shattered by ice and frost  Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas  and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys  carrying with them huge quantities of eroded rock debris  In dry areas the wind is the principal agent of erosion  It carries fine particles of sand  which bombard exposed rock surfaces  thereby wearing them into yet more sand  Even living things contribute to the formation of landscapes  Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and  in so doing  speed their splitting  In contrast  the roots of grasses and other small plants may help to hold loose soil fragments together  thereby helping to prevent erosion by the wind





1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following statements is true of changes in Earth s landscape

 They occur quickly in geological terms

2  The word  relatively  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unusually
 comparatively
 occasionally
 naturally


3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the mountains of the Himalayas
 Their current height is not an indication of their age
 At present  they are much higher than the mountains of the Caledonian range
 They were a uniform height about 400 million years ago
 They are not as high as the Caledonian mountains were 400 million years ago

4  The word  relics  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 resemblances
 regions
 remains
 restorations











5  According to paragraph 3  one cause of mountain formation is the
 effect of climatic change on sea level
 slowing down of volcanic activity
 force of Earth s crustal plates hitting each other
 replacement of sedimentary rock with volcanic rock


6  Why does the author mention Carbon dioxide in the passage
 To explain the origin of a chemical that can erode rocks
 To contrast carbon dioxide with carbonic acid
 To give an example of how rainwater penetrates soil
 To argue for the desirability of preventing erosion

 warms slightly



8  The word them in the passage refers to
 cold areas
 masses of ice
 valleys
 rock debris
9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 When they are relatively young  hills and mountains successfully resist the destructive forces of nature
 Although they seem permanent  hills and mountains exist for a relatively short period of geological time
 Hills and mountains successfully resist the destructive forces of nature  but only for a short time
 Hills and mountains resist the destructive forces of nature better than other types of landforms
