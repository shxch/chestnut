The Telephone and Modern Communications

Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. Ever since then, it has become a part of most people's everyday lives.  The first phone could only make or receive calls. Nowadays, they can send messages, connect to the Internet, take pictures, and do many other functions.

The main effect of the telephone was that it made communications both easier and faster. Before phones, people sent messages by letter or telegram. Letters were slow to be delivered. Sometimes, they never reached their destinations. Getting a reply could take even longer. Telegrams were faster. But they were like letters in some ways. All long-distance contact was in writing. But phones permitted instant communication by talking. This let people talk to one another much faster. And it increased the speed of life for people in general. Today, thanks to mobile phones, people can connect with others instantly from virtually anywhere in the world.
