Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an admissions officer at City College
Student
Hi  Can I ask you a few questions about starting classes during your summer session
Admissions officer
Sure  Ask away  It starts next week  you know
Student
Yeah  and I want to get some required courses out of the way so I can       maybe I can graduate one term earlier and get out into the job market sooner
Admissions officer
That sounds like a good idea  Let me pull up the summer school database on my computer here
Student
OK
Admissions officer
OK  there it is  What s your student ID number
Student
Oh  well  the thing is       I m not actually admitted here  I ll be starting school upstate at Hooper University in the fall  But I m down here for the summer  staying with my grandparents   cause I have a summer job near here
Admissions officer
Oh  I see  well
Student
So I m outta luck
Admissions officer
Well  you would be if you were starting anywhere but Hooper  But City College has a sort of special relationship with Hooper       a full exchange agreement       so our students can take classes at Hooper and vice versa  So if you can show me proof       um  your admissions letter from Hooper  then I can get you into our system here and give you an ID number
Student
Oh  cool  So       um       I wanna take a math course and a science course preferably biology  And I was also hoping to get my English composition course out of the way  too
Admissions officer
Well all three of those courses are offered in the summer  but you ve gotta understand that summer courses are condensed you meet longer hours and all the assignments are doubled up because       it s the same amount of information presented and tested as in a regular term  but it s only six weeks long  Two courses are considered full time in summer term  Even if you weren t working  I couldn t let you register for more than that
Student
Yeah  I was half expecting that  What about the schedule  Are classes only offered during the day
Admissions officer
Well  during the weak  we have some classes in the daytime and some at night  and on the weekends  we have some classes all day Saturday or all day Sunday for the six weeks
Student
My job is pretty flexible  so one on a weekday and one on a weekend shouldn t be any problem  OK  so after I bring you my admissions letter  how do I sign up for the classes
Admissions officer
Wall  as soon as your student ID number is assigned and your information is in our admissions system  you can register by phone almost immediately
Student
What about financial aid  Is it possible to get it for the summer
Admissions officer
Sorry  but that s something you would ve had to work out long before now  But the good news is that the tuition for our courses is about half of what you re going to be paying at Hooper
Student
Oh  well that helps  Thank you so much for answering all my questions  I ll be back tomorrow with my letter
Admissions officer
I won t be here then  but do you see that lady sitting at that desk over here  That s Ms  Brinker  I ll leave her a note about what we discussed  and she ll get you started
Student
Cool
Narrator
Listen again to part of the conversation  Then answer the question
Student
So I m outta luck
Admissions officer
Well  you would be if you were starting anywhere but Hooper
Narrator
What does the woman mean when she says this
Admissions officer
Well  you would be if you were starting anywhere but Hooper
