Conversation l Student & Clerk in the Bookstore
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and a clerk in the bookstore
Student  Hi  Can you tell me where to find New Kind of Science  By  uh  by Stephen Wolfram
Clerk  OK
Student     uh  I couldn t find it
Clerk  OK  Let me look it up on the computer for you  Who would you say the author was
Student  It s a Stephen Wolfram
Clerk  OK  Let s see    Hmm    no  it s not coming up  Hmm     I am not seeing it
Student  Um   hmm
Clerk  This is for a course here at the university  right
Student  Yeah  It s assigned reading for a class I am taking
Clerk  It s for the semester  right  You are not buying it in advance for next year or anything
Student  No  no  It s for a class I am taking now
Clerk  Hmm
Student  Oh  oh  you know what  Um  it s for a graduate class  Would that maybe make a difference  I mean  I am an undergrad  but I am just taking this one class in the graduate department  so
Clerk  No  no  I don t think that s it  That shouldn t make any difference  But  hmm    let me see    maybe it s just   it could be that whoever that entered it misspelled the title or the author s name  so I can t find it on the computer and I can t tell if it s sold out  But if it s sold out  we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so
Student  Well  uh  I was hoping to get it sooner because like we already have assignments and you know  I mean  I guess I can get it from the library
Clerk  Right  of course  But I am trying to check  If we ve ordered more  then that back orders information should be in the computer too  Let s see    back order    Wolfram  Stephen     no  no  I am not seeing it  I am sorry  We just don t seem to carry it
Student  Uh huh
Clerk  This is odd though  What is   what s your professor s name  I could try searching for his or her classes in the database  That might help
Student  Um   OK  It s professor Kayne
Clerk  K A N E
Student  No  It s professor Kayne  K A Y N E  He s in the computer science department
Clerk  Oh  It s for a computer science course  is it
Student  Yeah
Clerk  Well  that must be it  Computer science books are sold across the street in the computer bookstore
Student  Are there signs up anywhere
Clerk  I don t know
Student  Maybe they should put some up  It could have save us both some time
Clerk  Yeah  Well  anyway  I ll bet that s the problem  Check across the street  I ll bet they have it  But if not  come back  and I ll help you find it somewhere else  I can call around to see if other bookstores might have it  OK
Student  OK  Thanks a lot  Bye
Clerk  Bye
