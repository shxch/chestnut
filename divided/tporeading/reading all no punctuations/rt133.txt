In the study of perceptual abilities of infants  a number of techniques are used to determine infants  responses to various stimuli  Because they cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires  indirect techniques of naturalistic observation are used as the primary means of determining what infants can see  hear  feel  and so forth  Each of these methods compares an infant s state prior to the introduction of a stimulus with its state during or immediately following the stimulus  The difference between the two measures provides the researcher with an indication of the level and duration of the response to the stimulus  For example  if a uniformly moving pattern of some sort is passed across the visual field of a neonate  newborn   repetitive following movements of the eye occur  The occurrence of these eye movements provides evidence that the moving pattern is perceived at some level by the newborn  Similarly  changes in the infant s general level of motor activity  turning the head  blinking the eyes  crying  and so forth  have been used by researchers as visual indicators of the infant s perceptual abilities
Such techniques  however  have limitations  First  the observation may be unreliable in that two or more observers may not agree that the particular response occurred  or to what degree it occurred  Second  responses are difficult to quantify  Often the rapid and diffuse movements of the infant make it difficult to get an accurate record of the number of responses  The third  and most potent  limitation is that it is not possible to be certain that the infant s response was due to the stimulus presented or to a change from no stimulus to a stimulus  The infant may be responding to aspects of the stimulus different than those identified by the investigator  Therefore  when observational assessment is used as a technique for studying infant perceptual abilities  care must be taken not to overgeneralize from the data or to rely on one or two studies as conclusive evidence of a particular perceptual ability of the infant
Observational assessment techniques have become much more sophisticated  reducing the limitations just presented  Film analysis of the infant s responses  heart and respiration rate monitors  and nonnutritive sucking devices are used as effective tools in understanding infant perception  Film analysis permits researchers to carefully study the infant s responses over and over and in slow motion  Precise measurements can be made of the length and frequency of the infant s attention between two stimuli  Heart and respiration monitors provide the investigator with the number of heartbeats or breaths taken when a new stimulus is presented  Numerical increases are used as quantifiable indicators of heightened interest in the new stimulus  Increases in nonnutritive sucking were first used as an assessment measure by researchers in 1969  They devised an apparatus that connected a baby s pacifier to a counting device  As stimuli were presented  changes in the infant s sucking behavior were recorded  Increases in the number of sucks were used as an indicator of the infant s attention to or preference for a given visual display
Two additional techniques of studying infant perception have come into vogue  The first is the habituation dishabituation technique  in which a single stimulus is presented repeatedly to the infant until there is a measurable decline  habituation  in whatever attending behavior is being observed  At that point a new stimulus is presented  and any recovery  dishabituation  in responsiveness is recorded  If the infant fails to dishabituate and continues to show habituation with the new stimulus  it is assumed that the baby is unable to perceive the new stimulus as different  The habituation dishabituation paradigm has been used most extensively with studies of auditory and olfactory perception in infants  The second technique relies on evoked potentials  which are electrical brain responses that may be related to a particular stimulus because of where they originate  Changes in the electrical pattern of the brain indicate that the stimulus is getting through to the infant s central nervous system and eliciting some form of response
Each of the preceding techniques provides the researcher with evidence that the infant can detect or discriminate between stimuli  With these sophisticated observational assessment and electro physiological measures  we know that the neonate of only a few days is far more perceptive than previously suspected  However  these measures are only  indirect  indicators of the infant s perceptual abilities



1  Paragraph 1 indicates that researchers use indirect methods primarily to observe the
 range of motor activity in neonates
 frequency and duration of various stimuli
 change in an infant s state following the introduction of a stimulus
 range of an infant s visual field

2  The word uniformly in the passage is closest in meaning to
 clearly
 quickly
 consistently
 occasionally

3  Why does the author mention repetitive following movements of the eye
 To identify a response that indicates a neonate s perception of a stimulus
 To explain why a neonate is capable of responding to stimuli only through repetitive movements
 To argue that motor activity in a neonate may be random and unrelated to stimuli
 To emphasize that responses to stimuli vary in infants according to age
















4  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a problem in using the technique of direct observation
 It is impossible to be certain of the actual cause of an infant s response
 Infants  responses  which occur quickly and diffusely  are often difficult to measure
 Infants do not respond well to stimuli presented in an unnatural laboratory setting
 It may be difficult for observers to agree on the presence or the degree of a response

5  The word potent in the passage is closest in meaning to
 artificial
 powerful
 common
 similar

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Researchers using observational assessment techniques on infants must not overgeneralize and must base their conclusions on data from many studies
 On the basis of the data from one or two studies  it seems that some infants develop a particular perceptual ability not observed in others
 To use data from one or two studies on infant s perceptual abilities  it is necessary to use techniques that will provide conclusive evidence
 When researchers fail to make generalizations from their studies  their observed data is often inconclusive




















7  What is the author s primary purpose in paragraph 3
 To explain why researchers must conduct more than one type of study when they are attempting to understand infant perception
 To describe new techniques for observing infant perception that overcome problems identified in the previous paragraph
 To present and evaluate the conclusions of various studies on infant perception
 To point out the strengths and weaknesses of three new methods for quantifying an infant s reaction to stimuli


8  The word quantifiable in the passage is closest in meaning to
 visual
 permanent
 meaningful
 measurable


9  Paragraph 3 mentions all of the following as indications of an infant s heightened interest in a new stimulus EXCEPT an increase in
 sucking behavior
 heart rate
 the number of breaths taken
 eye movements








10  According to paragraph 4  which of the following leads to the conclusion that infants are able to differentiate between stimuli in a habituation dishabituation study
 Dishabituation occurs with the introduction of a new stimulus
 Electrical responses in the infant s brain decline with each new stimulus
 Habituation is continued with the introduction of a new stimulus
 The infant displays little change in electrical brain responses

11  In paragraph 4  what does the author suggest about the way an infant s brain perceives stimuli
 An infant s potential to respond to a stimulus may be related to the size of its brain
 Changes in the electrical patterns of an infant s brain are difficult to detect
 Different areas of an infant s brain respond to different types of stimuli
 An infant is unable to perceive more than one stimulus at a time


12  Paragraph 5 indicates that researchers who used the techniques described in the passage discovered that
 infants find it difficult to perceive some types of stimuli
 neonates of only a few days cannot yet discriminate between stimuli
 observational assessment is less useful for studying infant perception than researchers previously believed
 a neonate is able to perceive stimuli better than researchers once thought








13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
The repetition allows researchers to observe the infant s behavior until they reach agreement about the presence and the degree of the infant s response
Where would the sentence best fit

14． Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Researchers use a number of techniques to determine how infants respond to changes in their environment




Answer choices

 Data from observational methods must be confirmed through multiple studies
 New techniques for studying infant perception have improved the accuracy with which researchers observe and quantify infant responses
 Indirect observation is most accurate when researchers use it to test auditory and olfactory perception in neonates
 Visual indicators such as turning the head  blinking the eyes  or crying remain the best evidence of an infant s perceptual abilities
 Pacifiers are commonly used in studies to calm an infant who has been presented with excessive stimuli
 Sophisticated techniques that have aided new discoveries about perception in the neonate continue to be indirect measures
