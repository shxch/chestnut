Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a bookstore employee

Employee
Hi  Can I help you
Student
Yeah  I need to sell back a textbook  Are you the person I speak to about that
Employee
I am  But we can t buy textbooks back just yet  because the bookstore s buyback period isn t until next Thursday
Student
I thought it started this week
Employee
It is only in the last week of the semester after classes are over
Student
Oh  Well  can you tell me if this book will be on the buyback list
Employee
I can look  But we are still putting the list together  Professors have to tell us what books they ll definitely need again next semester  and the deadline for them to let us know isn t for a couple of days  So the list I have here is not really complete  Um…what class was the book for
Student
Intro to economics  with Professor Murphy
Employee
Professor Murphy  OK  I checked earlier and I know she hasn t gotten back to us on that class yet  So we don t know if she ll use the same book next time  Usually if an updated edition of a textbook is available  professors will go for that one
Student
Um…so if this book doesn t end up on the buyback list  what can I do  I spent over a hundred dollars for it  and I want to get something back
Employee
Well  if a professor didn t assign it for a class here  we could buy back for a whole seller who would distribute it for sale at another university bookstore
Student
OK
Employee
Anyway…if Professor Murphy does put it on the list  it is important thatyou come in as early as possible next Thursday  There s only a limited number of books we would buy back  Once we get the number of books we need for next semester  we would stop buying them
Student
OK  So how much money will I get for the book
Employee
Well  if it s on the buyback list  we ll pay fifty percent of what the new price was  But that also depends on what condition the book is in  so it needs to be cleaned up as much as possible
Student
Cleaned up
Employee
Because used books show wear and tear  you know  water stains  scruffy covers  yellow highlighting…You really need to make sure there are no pencil marks on the book  The price you can get for a text depends on the shape it s in
Student
You mean I have to erase all the pencil marks
Employee
If you want the best price for it…
Student
And what if you decide the book is too beat up and don t buy it back
Employee
That does happen  Hmm…well  one more thing you can try is to place an ad in the student newspaper to see if you can sell it directly to another student
