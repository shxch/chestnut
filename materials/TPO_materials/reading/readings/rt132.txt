Biological Clocks

Survival and successful reproduction usually require the activities of animals to be coordinated with predictable events around them  Consequently  the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely match periodic events like the solar day  the tides  the lunar cycle  and the seasons  The relations between animal activity and these periods  particularly for the daily rhythms  have been of such interest and importance that a huge amount of work has been done on them and the special research field of chronobiology has emerged  Normally  the constantly changing levels of an animal s activity sleeping  feeding  moving  reproducing  metabolizing  and producing enzymes and hormones  for example are well coordinated with environmental rhythms  but the key question is whether the animal s schedule is driven by external cues  such as sunrise or sunset  or is instead dependent somehow on internal timers that themselves generate the observed biological rhythms  Almost universally  biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes  a category that includes most organisms except bacteria and certain algae  have internal clocks  By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues  biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks  For instance  apparently normal daily periods of biological activity were maintained for about a week by the fungus Neurospora when it was intentionally isolated from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a space shuttle  The continuation of biological rhythms in an organism without external cues attests to its having an internal clock

When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark  even for four to five months  their compound eyes continue to adjust on a daily schedule for daytime and nighttime vision  Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to maintain a persistent rhythm of brain activity that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily schedule for bright or for weak light  Like almost all daily cycles of animals deprived of environmental cues  those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were not exactly 24 hours  Such a rhythm whose period is approximately but not exactly a day is called circadian  For different individual horseshoe crabs  the circadian period ranged from 22 2 to 25 5 hours  A particular animal typically maintains its own characteristic cycle duration with great precision for many days  Indeed  stability of the biological clock s period is one of its major features  even when the organism s environment is subjected to considerable changes in factors  such as temperature  that would be expected to affect biological activity strongly  Further evidence for persistent internal rhythms appears when the usual external cycles are shifted either experimentally or by rapid east west travel over great distances  Typically  the animal s daily internally generated cycle of activity continues without change  As a result  its activities are shifted relative to the external cycle of the new environment  The disorienting effects of this mismatch between external time cues and internal schedules may persist  like our jet lag  for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight darkness cycle reset the organism s clock to synchronize with the daily rhythm of the new environment

Animals need natural periodic signals like sunrise to maintain a cycle whose period is precisely 24 hours  Such an external cue not only coordinates an animal s daily rhythms with particular features of the local solar day but also because it normally does so day after day seems to keep the internal clock s period close to that of Earth s rotation  Yet despite this synchronization of the period of the internal cycle  the animal s timer itself continues to have its own genetically built in period close to  but different from  24 hours  Without the external cue  the difference accumulates and so the internally regulated activities of the biological day drift continuously  like the tides  in relation to the solar day  This drift has been studied extensively in many animals and in biological activities ranging from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running by squirrels  Light has a predominating influence in setting the clock  Even a fifteen minute burst of light in otherwise sustained darkness can reset an animal s circadian rhythm  Normally  internal rhythms are kept in step by regular environmental cycles  For instance  if a homing pigeon is to navigate with its Sun compass  its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight darkness cycle

 They can vary significantly from day to day
 They are not the same for all members of a single species
 They become longer over time

7  According to paragraph 2  what will an animal experience when its internal rhythms no longer correspond with the daily cycle of the environment
 Disorientation
 Change in period of the internal rhythms

8  In paragraph 2  the author provides evidence for the role of biological clocks by
 listing the daily activities of an animal s cycle  sleeping  feeding  moving  reproducing  metabolizing  and producing enzymes and hormones
 describing the process of establishing the period of a biological clock
 presenting cases in which an animal s daily schedule remained stable despite lack of environmental cues
 contrasting animals whose daily schedules fluctuate with those of animals whose schedules are constant

9  The word duration in the passage is closest in meaning to
 length
 feature
 process
 repetition



10  In paragraph 2  why does the author mention that the period for different horseshoe crabs ranges from 22 2 to 25 5 hours
 To illustrate that an animal s internal clock seldom has a 24 hour cycle
 To argue that different horseshoe crabs will shift from daytime to nighttime vision at different times
 To illustrate the approximate range of the circadian rhythm of all animals
 To support the idea that external cues are the only factors affecting an animal s periodic behavior



11  The word  it  in the passage refers to
 an external cue such as sunrise
 the daily rhythm of an animal
 the local solar day
 a cycle whose period is precisely 24 hours

12  The word  sustained  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 intense
 uninterrupted
 natural
 periodic



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Because the internal signals that regulate waking and going to sleep tend to align themselves with these external cues  the external clock appears to dominate the internal clock
Where would the sentence best fit

The activity of animals is usually coordinated with periodically recurring events in the environment




Answer Choices

 Most animals survive and reproduce successfully without coordinating their activities to external environmental rhythms
 The circadian period of an animal s internal clock is genetically determined and basically unchangeable
 Environmental cues such as a change in temperature are enough to reset an animal s clock
 Animals have internal clocks that influence their activities even when environmental cues are absent
 Animals are less affected by large differences between their internal rhythms and the local solar day than are humans
 Because an animal s internal clock does not operate on a 24 hour cycle  environmental stimuli are needed to keep the biological day aligned with the solar day
