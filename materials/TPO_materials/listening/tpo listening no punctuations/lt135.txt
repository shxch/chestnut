TPO 13 Lecture 3 Poetry

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a poetry class  the professor is discussing
medieval poetry

Professor
OK  so the two poems we are looking at today fall into the category of     uh     medieval
times  which was how long ago

Student
Almost a thousand years ago  right

Professor
Yes  that s right

Student
But  professor  are you sure these are poems  I mean I thought poems were shorter  these are more like long stories  I mean one of them was all about love  but the other one  the Chan…Chan…whatever it s called  the other one  well  it was all about fighting and battles  I mean can both of them be considered poems

Professor
Well  think back to the very beginning of this course

Student
Uh huh

Professor
Remember how we  we define poetry  In the very broadest sense  we said it s written to evoke  to make you  the audience  have some kind of the emotional experience through the use of imagery  um  some kind of predictable rhythm  And usually  but not always  there s more than one meaning implied with the words that are used

Let s start with the Chanson poetry first  That s Chanson  Chanson poems became popular in Europe  particularly in France  and the term is actually short for a longer French phrase that translates to um     uh… songs of deeds

Now  they were called songs of deeds because strangely enough  they were written to describe the heroic deeds or actions of warriors  the knights during conflicts  We don t know a lot about the authors  it s still contested somewhat  But we are pretty sure about who the Chanson poems were written for  That is   they were written for knights and the lords   the nobility that they served  The poems were sung  performed by a minstrel  a singer who travelled from castle to castle  singing to the local lord and his knights  Uh… well  would someone summarize the main features of the Chanson poem you read

Student
Well  there s a hero  a knight  who goes to battle  and he is admired for his courage  bravery and loyalty  loyalty to the lord he serves  his country and his fellow warriors in the field  He s     um    he has a  he s a skilled fighter  willing to face the most extreme dangers  sacrificial  willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country

Professor
Ok  now  given that the intended audience for these poems were knights and lords  What can we say about the purpose of Chanson poetry  What kinds of feelings was it meant to provoke

Student
I guess they must ve been really appealing to those knights and lords who were listening to them  Hearing the songs probably made them feel more patriotic  made them feel like it was a good and noble thing to serve their countries in whatever way they could

Professor
Good  we ve got a pretty good picture of what the Chanson hero was like  Now let s compare that to the hero in the other poem  The other poem is an example of what s called Romance Poetry  And the hero in the Romance poem was also a knight  But what made the knight in Romance Poetry different from the knight in Chanson poetry

Well  first the purpose of the hero s actions was different  The hero in Romance Poetry is independent  purely solitary in a way  not like the Chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions  He doesn t engage in conflict to protect his lord or country  He does it for the sake of adventure  to improve himself  to show he s worthy of respect and love from his lady  He s very conscious of the particular rules of social behavior he has to live up to somehow  And all of his actions are for the purpose of proving that he is an upright  moral  well mannered  well behaved individual  You may have noticed that in Chanson poetry  there isn t much about the hero s feelings  The focus is on the actions  the deeds  But the Romance Poetry describes a lot of the inner feelings  the motivations  psychology you could say  of a knight trying to improve himself  to better himself  so that he s worthy of the love of a woman

What explains this difference  Well  uh  digging into the historical context tells us a lot  Romance Poetry emerged a few generations after Chanson  and its roots were in geographic regions of France that were calmer  where conflict wasn t central to people s lives  More peaceful times meant there was more time for education  travel  more time for reflection  Another name for Romance Poetry that s often synonymous with it is troubadour poetry

Troubadours were the authors of these new Romance poems  And we know a lot more about the troubadours than we do about the Chanson authors  because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems that gave pretty specific information about their social status  geographical location and a small outline of their career  These information wasn t particularly reliable because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories of great adventure or scraped together from parts of different poems  But there is enough there to squeeze or infer some facts about their social class  The political climate had settled down enough so that troubadours had the luxury of being able to spend most if not all of their time  creating  crafting or composing their love songs for their audiences  And yes these poems were also sung  many troubadours were able to make a living being full time poets which should tell you something about the value of that profession during medieval times
