Cognitive Dissonance

People often act in a manner different from how they believe or feel. For instance, a woman may think she is good yet does something bad. Or a man may go shopping, buy an expensive item, and then think he wasted his money. This feeling is known as cognitive dissonance. People may feel strong or weak levels of dissonance based on a number of factors. Some are the importance of the situation, the size of the gap between the belief and the action, and the person's ability to explain the situation to him or herself.

When a situation is important, a person's feeling of dissonance increases. For example, buying a car is a big decision. A person who thinks he has bought the wrong car will have trouble returning it. Yet that same person can easily return a pair of shoes he regrets buying. Thus the person will feel less dissonance from buying the shoes than he will from buying the car. Similarly, a wide gap between the thought and the action will make the dissonance increase. A person may believe her friend is open minded. So if that friend makes a racist remark, the person may be shocked and greatly change her feelings about her friend.

A person's ability to deal with cognitive dissonance depends on how it affects that person. Some people try to justify their actions. The man may claim he bought an expensive car because it was the best one available. This helps ease his bad feelings. Other people may change their beliefs to fit the situation. A woman may believe that owning a gold ring will make her happy. Yet when she is unable to get the ring, she may convince herself that having it would not really have made her happy.
