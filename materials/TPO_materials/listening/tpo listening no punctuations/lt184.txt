A  Well  I m glad you redid your outline  I fed a few comments  but nothing you have to act on  It s in good enough shape for you to start writing you paper
B  Thanks  At first I was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time
A  Well  especially with a challenging topic like yours  factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline  There s just so much history to consider  you could get lost without a solid outline  So did you have a question
B  Yeah  it s about…you mentioned needing volunteers for a research study
A  Yep  it s not my study  It s my colleague s in the marketing department  She needs people to watch various new TV programs that haven t been broadcast yet  then indicate on a survey whether they liked it  why  if they d watch another episode  It d be kind of fun plus participants get a $50 gift certificate
B  Wow  well I like the sound of that  But…so they are trying to predict if the shows are gonna succeed or fail  right  based on students  opinions  Why would they care what we think
A  Hey  don t sell yourself short  People your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on television  The study is sponsored by a TV network  If enough students don t like the show  the network may actually reconsider putting it on the air
B  OK  well  how do I sign up
A  You just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot  although it looks like the only times left are next Monday morning and Thursday evening
B  Oh  well  I have marketing and economics Monday mornings and Thursday
A  OH  you are taking the marketing class  Who s teaching it
B  It s Professor Largin   Intro to Marketing  Hr hasn t mentioned the study though
A  Oh  well  the marketing department s pretty big  I happen to be friends with a woman who is doing the TV study  Ok  well  we don t want you missing class  How s Thursday
B  Oh  I work from 5 till 9 that night  Hmm  no flexibility with your schedule  Where do you work
A  Oh  I like Fox s  I eat there every week  Maybe you could switch shifts with someone
B  I m still in training  And the only night my trainer works is Thursday  Look
A  I know the owners there really well  Why don t you let me give them a call and explain the situation
B  OK  It d be cool to be part of a real research study  And the gift certificate wouldn t hurt either
