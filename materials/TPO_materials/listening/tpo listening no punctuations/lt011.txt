Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a librarian

Student
Hi  um…  I really hope you can help me

Librarian
That s why I m here  What can I do for you

Student
I m supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course  but I m… having a hard time finding articles  I don t even know where to start looking

Librarian
You said this is for your psychology course  right  So your focus is on …

Student
Dream Interpretation

Librarian
Well  you have a focus  so that s already a good start  Hmmm… well  there re a few things… oh wait… have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve

Student
Aha  that s one thing I did know to do  I just copied an article  but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals

Librarian
Let s get you going on looking for those then  We have printed versions of twenty or so psychology journals in the Reference Section  These are ones published within the last year  Now that I think about it… there s a journal named Sleep and Dreams

Student
Oh  yeah  the article I just copied is from that journal  so I ve got to look in other sources

Librarian
Ok  actually  most of our materials are available electronically now  You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library s computers  and if you want to search by title with the word  dream  for example  just type it in and all the articles with  dream  in the title will come up on the screen

Student
Cool  that s great  Too bad I cannot do this from home

Librarian
But you can  All of the library s databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network

Student
Really   I can t believe I didn t know that  It still sounds like it s going to take a while though  you know  going through all of that information  all of those sources

Librarian
Maybe  but you already narrowed your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation  so it shouldn t be too bad  And you probably notice that there s an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied  When you go into the databases and electronic sources  you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen  skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time

Student
Right  abstracts  They ll definitely make the project more doable  I guess I should try out the electronic search while I m still here then  you know  just in case

Librarian
Sure  er… that computer s free over there  and I ll be here till five this afternoon

Student
Thanks  I feel a lot better about this assignment now
