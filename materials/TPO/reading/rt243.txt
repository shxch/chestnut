Moving into Pueblos
In the Mesa Verde area of the ancient North American Southwest  living patterns changed in the thirteenth century  with large numbers of people moving into large communal dwellings called pueblos  often constructed at the edges of canyons  especially on the sides of cliffs  Abandoning small extended family households to move into these large pueblos with dozens if not hundreds of other people was probably traumatic  Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today allow us to deal with dense populations existed for these people accustomed to household autonomy and the ability to move around the landscape almost at will  And besides the awkwardness of having to share walls with neighbors  living in aggregated pueblos introduced other problems  For people in cliff dwellings  hauling water  wood  and food to their homes was a major chore  The stress on local resources  especially in the firewood needed for daily cooking and warmth  was particularly intense  and conditions in aggregated pueblos were not very hygienic

Given all the disadvantages of living in aggregated towns  why did people in the thirteenth century move into these closely packed quarters  For transitions of such suddenness  archaeologists consider either pull factors  benefits that drew families together  or push factors  some external threat or crisis that forced people to aggregate   In this case  push explanations dominate

Population growth is considered a particularly influential push  After several generations of population growth  people packed the landscape in densities so high that communal pueblos may have been a necessary outcome  Around Sand Canyon  for example  populations grew from 5  12 people per square kilometer in the tenth century to as many as 30   50 by the 1200s  As densities increased  domestic architecture became larger  culminating in crowded pueblos  Some scholars expand on this idea by emphasizing a corresponding need for arable land to feed growing numbers of people  construction of small dams  reservoirs  terraces  and field houses indicates that farmers were intensifying their efforts during the 1200s  Competition for good farmland may also have prompted people to bond together to assert rights over the best fields

Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age  a climatic phenomenon that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere  Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner  some evidence suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth century  The environmental changes associated with this transition are not fully understood  but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains  to the northeast of Mesa Verde  were affected first  Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season  As the Little Ice Age progressed  farmers probably moved their fields to lower elevations  infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together  thus contributing to the aggregations  Archaeologists identify a corresponding shift in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations

In the face of all these pushes  people in the Mesa Verde area had yet another reason to move into communal villages  the need for greater cooperation  Sharing and cooperation were almost certainly part of early Puebloan life  even for people living in largely independent single household residences scattered across the landscape  Archaeologists find that even the most isolated residences during the eleventh and twelfth centuries obtained some pottery  and probably food  from some distance away  while major ceremonial events were opportunities for sharing food and crafts  Scholars believe that this cooperation allowed people to contend with a patchy environment in which precipitation and other resources varied across the landscape  if you produce a lot of food one year  you might trade it for pottery made by a distant ally who is having difficulty with crops and the next year  the flow of goods might go in the opposite direction  But all of this appears to have changed thirteenth century  Although the climate remained as unpredictable as ever between one year and the next  it became much less locally diverse  In a bad year for farming  everyone was equally affected  No longer was it helpful to share widely  Instead  the most sensible thing would be for neighbors to combine efforts to produce as much food as possible  and thus aggregated towns were a sensible arrangement

 occupied dwellings that were built into the sides of cliffs
 were largely free to conduct their lives as they pleased
 enforced common standards of behavior and cooperative conduct within their communities

4  Which of the following best indicates the organization of paragraph 1
 It presents the conditions that caused a change in a population  s living patterns and then explains why those conditions got worse
 It identifies certain present day cultural traditions and rules and then traces them to their roots in the thirteenth century
 It casts doubt on one explanation of the move to pueblos and then introduces an alternative explanation that the passage will defend
 It describes a major change in a population  s living patterns and then presents a number of problems that resulted from that change








5  According to paragraph 3  which of the following was one of the consequences of increasing population densities
 People were increasingly crowded into collections of large housing units
 People stopped planting crops that have relatively low yields
 Domestic buildings were pushed beyond the canyon limits
 The natural landscape was destroyed

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Some scholars even claim that the intensification of farmers  various efforts during the 1200s led to further population growth and the consequent need for more arable land
 Evidence of intensifying agriculture in the 1200s indicates a need to feed a larger population and so extends the argument that a growing population was the cause of the move to pueblos
 During the 1200s  farmers met the demand for more arable land  but they also succeeded in cultivating existing land more intensively with the help of agricultural construction projects
 Some scholars feel strongly that the construction of small dams  reservoirs  terraces  and field houses in the thirteenth century is independent evidence for growth in the number of people

 problem

8  Why does the author state that  Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season
 To explain why the higher elevations were always relatively sparsely populated
 To suggest that any worsening of conditions would have significant consequences
 To emphasize how resourceful the people growing food at these elevations were
 To argue that farming was not the primary source of food at high elevations

9  According to paragraph 4  what did farmers do in response to falling temperatures during the Little Ice Age
 Moved to areas away from Mesa Verde
 Moved closer to the northeastern part of Mesa Verde
 Began to cultivate crops adapted to a short growing season
 Gave up the cultivation of the highest lying lands

















10  According to paragraph 5  major ceremonial events were occasions for
 leaders to persuade people from the countryside to move into a pueblo
 farmers to collect information about where crops could be reliably grown
 people to develop better techniques for producing pottery and crafts
 people in the early Puebloan era to share farm and craft products

11  According to paragraph 5  which of the following was a reason people in the Mesa Verde area formed communal villages in the thirteenth century
 The climate in the Mesa Verde area became more locally diverse
 Individuals were no longer interested in exchanging pottery and food
 Cooperation between people became more important for survival
 Bad years of farming began to occur more frequently

12  Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements about cooperation among the people in the Mesa Verde area from the eleventh through the thirteenth century
 Cooperation allowed many households to give up farming and to specialize in making pottery and crafts
 People went from exchanging food and crafts they individually produced to sharing in a cooperative effort to produce as much food as possible
 Overtime there was less cooperation as farmers competed with each other for trade with distant areas
 	Individuals stopped cooperating with each other because they did not have enough food for themselves

In the thirteenth century  the people in the Mesa Verde area went from living in scattered independent households to living in large pueblos




Answer Choices

 Because the thirteenth century inhabitants of the Mesa Verde area did not have the cultural expectations of today s city dwellers  they easily adapted to communal life
 Even though living in pueblos had disadvantages  the population of the area had grown so large that there may have been no other arrangement that would have met its needs
 From the eleventh century onward  farmers began to increase food production on existing farmland and started bringing more land under cultivation
 A development that contributed to increasing population densities was a cooling climate that led many people to leave the coldest areas and crowd into climatically more favorable areas
 The primary reason for moving to pueblos was the social benefits associated with communal life
 People were brought together by the need to produce food cooperatively  as the use of food surpluses in one place to relieve shortages in another ended due to a change in climate
