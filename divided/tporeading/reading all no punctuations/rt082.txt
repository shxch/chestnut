Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic alterations associated with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from plate tectonics  Off and on throughout the Cretaceous  the last period of the Mesozoic era  during which dinosaurs flourished   large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents  Data from diverse sources  including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments  indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than today s  The days were not too hot  nor the nights too cold  The summers were not too warm  nor the winters too frigid  The shallow seas on the continents probably buffered the temperature of the nearby air  keeping it relatively constant


At the end of the Cretaceous  the geological record shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the major ocean basins  No one knows why  Over a period of about 100 000 years  while the seas pulled back  climates around the world became dramatically more extreme  warmer days  cooler nights  hotter summers  colder winters  Perhaps dinosaurs could not tolerate these extreme temperature changes and became extinct


If true  though  why did cold blooded animals such as snakes  lizards  turtles  and crocodiles survive the freezing winters and torrid summers  These animals are at the mercy of the climate to maintain a livable body temperature  It s hard to understand why they would not be affected  whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to cope  especially if  as some scientists believe  dinosaurs were warm blooded  Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had retreated from and advanced on the continents numerous times during the Mesozoic  so why did the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with the earlier fluctuations but not with this one  Although initially appealing  the hypothesis of a simple climatic change related to sea levels is insufficient to explain all the data


Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions led to a surprising observation that  in turn  has suggested a new hypothesis  Many plants and animals disappear abruptly from the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic  the era after the Mesozoic   Between the last layer of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic rock  there is often a thin layer of clay  Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determining how long it took to deposit this one centimeter of clay and they thought they could determine the time it took to deposit the clay by determining the amount of the element iridium  Ir  it contained


Ir has not been common at Earth s since the very beginning of the planet s history  Because it usually exists in a metallic state  it was preferentially incorporated in Earth s core as the planet cooled and consolidated  Ir is found in high concentrations in some meteorites  in which the solar system s original chemical composition is preserved  Even today  microscopic meteorites continually bombard Earth  falling on both land and sea  By measuring how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a given period of time  scientists can estimate how long it might have taken to deposit the observed amount of Ir in the boundary clay  These calculations suggest that a period of about one million years would have been required  However  other reliable evidence suggests that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years  So the unusually high concentration of Ir seems to require a special explanation


In view of these facts  scientists hypothesized that a single large asteroid  about 10 to 15 kilometers across  collided with Earth  and the resulting fallout created the boundary clay  Their calculations show that the impact kicked up a dust cloud that cut off sunlight for several months  inhibiting photosynthesis in plants  decreased surface temperatures on continents to below freezing  caused extreme episodes of acid rain  and significantly raised long term global temperatures through the greenhouse effect  This disruption of food chain and climate would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years

1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is true of the Late Cretaceous climate
 Summers were very warm and winters were very cold
 Shallow seas on the continents caused frequent temperature changes
 The climate was very similar to today s climate
 The climate did not change dramatically from season to season









2  Which of the following reasons is suggested in paragraph 2 for the extinction of the dinosaurs
 Changes in the lengths of the days and nights during the late Cretaceous period
 Droughts caused by the movement of seaways back into the oceans
 The change from mild to severe climates during the Late Cretaceous period
 An extreme decrease in the average yearly temperature over 10 ooo years











3  Why does the author mention the survival of  snakes  lizards  turtles  and crocodiles  in paragraph 3
 To argue that dinosaurs may have become extinct because they were not cold blooded animals
 To question the adequacy of the hypothesis that climatic change related to sea levels caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
 To present examples of animals that could maintain a livable body temperature more easily than dinosaurs
 To support a hypothesis that these animals were not as sensitive to climate changes in the Cretaceous period as they are today

4  The word  cope  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 adapt
 move
 continue
 compete

5  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is true of changes in climate before the Cretaceous period and the effect of these changes on dinosaurs
 Climate changes associated with the movement of seaways before the Cretaceous period did not cause dinosaurs to become extinct
 Changes in climate before the Cretaceous period caused severe fluctuations in sea level  resulting in the extinction of the dinosaurs
 Frequent changes in climate before the Cretaceous period made dinosaurs better able to maintain a livable body temperature
 Before the Cretaceous period there were few changes in climate  and dinosaurs flourished


6  The word  fluctuations  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 extremes
 retreats
 periods
 	variations




7  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  In correct choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The fossil record suggests that there was an abrupt extinction of many plants and animals at the end of the Mesozoic era
 Few fossils of the Mesozoic era have survived in the rocks that mark the end of the Cretaceous
 Fossils from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic up to the beginning of the Cenozoic era have been removed from the layers of rock that surrounded them
 Plants and animals from the Mesozoic era were unable to survive in the Cenozoic era


8  In paragraph 4  all the following questions are answered EXCEPT
 Why is there a layer of clay between the rocks of the Cretaceous and Cenozoic
 Why were scientists interested in determining how long it took to deposit the layer of clay at the end of the Cretaceous
 What was the effect of the surprising observation scientists made
 Why did scientists want more information about the dinosaur extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous














9  The word  bombard  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 approach
 strike
 pass
 circle

10  Paragraph 5 implies that a special explanation of Ir in the boundary clay is needed because
 the Ir in microscopic meteorites reaching Earth during the Cretaceous period would have been incorporated into Earth s core
 the Ir in the boundary clay was deposited much more than a million years ago
 the concentration of Ir in the boundary clay is higher than in microscopic meteorites
 the amount of Ir in the boundary clay is too great to have come from microscopic meteorites during the time the boundary clay was deposited


11  The word  disruption  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 exhaustion
 disturbance
 modification
 disappearance

12  Paragraph 6 mentions all of the following effects of the hypothesized asteroid collision EXCEPT
 a large dust cloud that blocked sunlight
 an immediate drop in the surface temperatures of the continents
 an extreme decrease in rainfall on the continents
 a long term increase in global temperatures

13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Consequently  the idea that the Ir in the boundary clay came from microscopic meteorites cannot be accepted
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
For a long time scientists have argued that the extinction of the dinosaurs was related to climate change









Answer choices

 A simple climate change does not explain some important data related to the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous
 The retreat of the seaways at the end of the Cretaceous has not been fully explained
 The abruptness of extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous and the high concentration of Ir found in clay deposited at that time have fueled the development of a new hypothesis
 Extreme changes in daily and seasonal climates preceded the retreat of the seas back into the major ocean basins
 Some scientists hypothesize that the extinction of the dinosaurs resulted from the effects of an asteroid collision with Earth
 Boundary clay layers like the one between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic are used by scientists to determine the rate at which an extinct species declined
