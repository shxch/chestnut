The earliest of the city states of the ancient Near East appeared at the southern end of the Mesopotamian plain  the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq  It was here that the civilization known as Sumer emerged in its earliest form in the fifth millennium  At first sight  the plain did not appear to be a likely home for a civilization  There were few natural resources  no timber  stone  or metals  Rainfall was limited  and what water there was rushed across the plain in the annual flood of melted snow  As the plain fell only 20 meters in 500 kilometers  the beds of the rivers shifted constantly  It was this that made the organization of irrigation  particularly the building of canals to channel and preserve the water  essential  Once this was done and the silt carried down by the rivers was planted  the rewards were rich  four to five times what rain fed earth would produce  It was these conditions that allowed an elite to emerge  probably as an organizing class  and to sustain itself through the control of surplus crops

It is difficult to isolate the factors that led to the next development the emergence of urban settlements  The earliest  that of Eridu  about 4500 B C E   and Uruk  a thousand years later  center on impressive temple complexes built of mud brick  In some way  the elite had associated themselves with the power of the gods  Uruk  for instance  had two patron gods Anu  the god of the sky and sovereign of all other gods  and Inanna  a goddess of love and war and there were others  patrons of different cities  Human beings were at their mercy  The biblical story of the Flood may originate in Sumer  In the earliest version  the gods destroy the human race because its clamor had been so disturbing to them

It used to be believed that before 3000 B C E  the political and economic life of the cities was centered on their temples  but it now seems probable that the cities had secular rulers from earliest times  Within the city lived administrators  craftspeople  and merchants   Trading was important  as so many raw materials  the semiprecious stones for the decoration of the temples  timbers for roofs  and all metals  had to be imported   An increasingly sophisticated system of administration led in about 3300 B C E  to the appearance of writing  The earliest script was based on logograms  with a symbol being used to express a whole word  The logograms were incised on damp clay tablets with a stylus with a wedge shape at its end   The Romans called the shape cuneus and this gives the script its name of cuneiform   Two thousand logograms have been recorded from these early centuries of writing  A more economical approach was to use a sign to express not a whole word but a single syllable   To take an example  the Sumerian word for  head  was  sag   Whenever a word including a syllable in which the sound  sag  was to be written  the sign for  sag  could be used to express that syllable with the remaining syllables of the word expressed by other signs   By 2300 B C E  the number of signs required had been reduced to 600  and the range of words that could be expressed had widened  Texts dealing with economic matters predominated  as they always had done  but at this point works of theology  literature  history  and law also appeared

Other innovations of the late fourth millennium include the wheel  probably developed first as a more efficient way of making pottery and then transferred to transport  A tablet engraved about 3000 B C E  provides the earliest known example from Sumer  a roofed boxlike sledge mounted on four solid wheels  A major development was the discovery  again about 3000 B C E   that if copper  which had been known in Mesopotamia since about 3500 B C E   was mixed with tin  a much harder metal  bronze  would result  Although copper and stone tools continued to be used  bronze was far more successful in creating sharp edges that could be used as anything from saws and scythes to weapons  The period from 3000 to 1000 B C E   when the use of bronze became widespread  is normally referred to as the Bronze Age


 
1  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a disadvantage of the Mesopotamian plain
 There was not very much rainfall for most of the year
  Melting snow caused flooding every year
  The silt deposited by rivers damaged crops
  Timber  stone and metals were not readily available

  New crops were developed that were better suited to conditions on the Mesopotamian plain
  The richest individuals managed to gain control of the most valuable cropland
  Control over the few available natural resources made some people four to five times richer than everyone else
  The building of canals to increase agricultural output required organization

3  The word  sustain  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  defend

  A rapidly expanding and changing population

7  In paragraph 3  why does the author provide the information that the number of signs in use had dropped from 2 000 to 600 by 2300 B C E
  To argue that the development of writing involved periods of growth followed by periods of decline
  To demonstrate that earlier written texts used a larger vocabulary than later texts  which were aimed at a broader audience
  To support the claim that the range of words expressed by logograms varied widely depending on time period and type of text
  To provide evidence for the increased efficiency of using signs to express syllables rather than whole words

8  According to paragraph 3  ancient texts most commonly dealt with
  theology
  literature
  economics

9  According to paragraph 4  the earliest wheels probably
 were first developed in areas outside Mesopotamia

  appeared on boxlike sledges
  were used to transport goods between cities

10  The word  engraved  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  carved
  produced
 dated
  discovered

11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  Also around 3000 B C E   it was discovered that mixing copper  known from about 3500 B C E   with tin would create a much harder metal known as bronze
  Although copper had been known since 3500 B C E in Mesopotamia  the discovery of bronze did not occur until around 3000 B C E
  Another major development around 3000 B C E  was the discovery that copper could be mixed with a much harder metal known as tin
  The development of bronze by mixing copper and tin probably occurred around 3000 B C E  but may have happened as early as 3500 B C E

  obvious
  significant
