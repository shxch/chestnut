TPO 18 Lecture 1 Astronomy

We are going to start a study of sunspots today  and I think you ll find it rather interesting  Now I m going to assume that you know that sunspots  in the most basic terms  are dark spots on the Sun s surface  That will do for now  The ancient Chinese were the first to record observations of sunspots as early as the year 165  When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots  they didn t believe that the spots were actually on the Sun  That s because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies  the Sun  Moon  Stars  and Planets  were perfect  without any flaws or blemishes  So the opinion was the spots were actually something else  like shadows of planets crossing the Sun s face  And this was the thinking of European astronomers until the introduction of the telescope  which brings us to our old friend  Galileo  In the early 1600s  based on his observations of sunspots  Galileo proposed a new hypothesis  He pointed out that the shape of sunspots  well  the sunspots weren t circular  If they were shadows of the planets  they would be circular  right  So that was a problem for the prevailing view  And he also noticed that the shape of the sunspots changed as they seemed to move across the Sun s surface  Maybe a particular sunspot was sort of square  then later it would become more lopsided  then later something else  So there is another problem with the shadow hypothesis  because the shape of a planet doesn t change  What Galileo proposed was that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun  but he didn t know what kind of feature  He proposed that they might be clouds in the atmosphere  the solar atmosphere  especially because they seemed to change shape and there was no predicting the changes  at least nothing Galileo could figure out  That random shape changing would be consistent with the spots being clouds  Over the next couple hundred years  a lot of hypotheses were tossed around  The spots were mountains or holes in the solar atmosphere through which the dark surface of the Sun could be seen  Then in 1843  astronomer named Heinrich Schwa be made an interesting claim  Trobe had been watching the Sun every day that it was visible for 17 years  looking for evidence of a new planet  And he started keeping tracks of sunspots  mapping them  so he wouldn t confuse them  so he wouldn t confuse them with any potential new planet  In the end  there was no planet  but there was evidence that the number of sunspots increased and decreased in a pattern  a pattern that began repeating after 10 years  and that was a huge breakthrough  Another astronomer named Wolf kept track of the Sun for an even longer period  40 years actually  So Wolf did 40 years of research  and Trobe did 17 years of research  I think there is a lesson there  Anyway  Wolf went though all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a history of sunspot observations going back about 100 years  From this information  he was able to confirm the existence of a pattern  a repeating cycle but Wolf detected an 11 year cycles  Dose that sound familiar to anyone  No  Well  geomagnetic activity  the natural variations in Earth s magnetic field  it fluctuates in 11 year cycles  Well  we ll cover this later in this semester  but for now  well  scientists in the late 19th century were aware of geomagnetic cycles  so when they heard that the sunspots  cycle was also 11 years  well  they just had to find out what was going on  Suddenly  everyone was doing studies of the possible relationship between the Sun and the Earth  Did the sunspots cause the geomagnetic fields or did the geomagnetic fields cause the sunspots  Or is there some other thing that caused both  And astronomers did eventually figure out what sunspots had to do with magnetic fields  And the fact that sunspots are magnetic fields accounts for their dark appearance  That s because magnetic fields reduce the pressure exerted on the gases inside of them  making the spots cooler than the rest of the Sun s surface  And since they are cooler  they are darker
