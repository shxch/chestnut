Early Movie Projectors 

Nowadays, people watch movies on videotape, DVD, the Internet, and television. But the early days of movies are different. Then, films were shown on movie projectors. The first movie projectors were made in the 1890s. Th were box-like devices. They showed a short film strip. It was usually less than a minute long. The viewer had to look through a lens to see the film.

There were several problems with these machines. First, the films were very short. Second, they were small, so only one person could view the film strip at a time. Third, they often developed mechanical problems and broke down. To show films to more people, inventors created better projectors. These could show longer movies on bigger screens. That way, a larger paying audience could watch the films. This became the main way that people watched movies.
