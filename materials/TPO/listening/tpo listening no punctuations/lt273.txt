Lecture2 History of Musical Instruments  Violins

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history of musical instruments class

Professor

So musical instruments evolved in ways that optimize their acoustical properties  how the instrument vibrates and sends those vibration through the air to our eardrums

Now professional musicians are very particular about their instruments  they want instruments that help them fully express the intent of the composer  which of course translates into a more enjoyable listening experience for the audience members  Yet most audience members probably aren t even aware of how much the instrument matters  I mean  OK  Think about the last concert you attended  When you applauded  what went through your mind

Student

I recently heard a violinist who totally blew me away  So when I applauded  I guess I was showing my appreciation for his skill  the hours of practicing he must have put in

Professor

And his violin

Student

Didn t really think about it  It looked exactly like mine  which is inspiring in a way knowing my violin could also produce beautiful tones  that maybe I would sound that good someday

Professor

I hope you do  But if your violin isn t as good as hisâ€¦

Student

You mean he might not sound as good playing my violin

Professor

As I said  tone quality differs from instrument to instrument  The question is why  Why does one instrument sound more beautiful than another  even if they look identical

There s a particularly interesting case with an extraordinary generation of violins made in Northern Italy  in the city of Cremona  back in the late 1600s   early 1700s  These vintage Cremonese violins are considered the best in the world  But it s not like the makers of those violins were any more skilled than their modern day counterparts  They weren t  Today s top violin makers can pretty much replicate all the physical attributes of a Cremonese violin  But it s generally thought that the acoustical quality of modern violins doesn t live up to the quality of the vintage ones

Student

So what attributes of the old violins have been replicated

Professor

Oh  their dimensions  shape  their fingerboard height  uh  general craftsmanship  For a long time  people thought the varnish used to coat and protect the violins was special  But research showed it was the same ordinary varnish used on furniture  However  researchers have discovered that there are something special about the wood the violins were made from  And recently they have been able to replicate that too

Student

How  Unless the trees that Cremonese used are still alive

Professor

The trees weren t replicated  just the wood  specifically the wood s density  Density is determined by how trees grow  Trees  old trees that don t grow in the tropics grow seasonally  they grow faster early in the year in the springtime than they do later in the year  So early growth wood is relatively porous  Late growth wood is denser  less porous  And this variation shows up in the trees growth rings  The denser layers are generally darker than the less dense layers  We call this variation the density differential  Variations in wood density affect vibrations  and therefore  sound  When scientists first analyzed the wood of vintage Cremonese violins in compared with the modern violin wood  they calculated the average density and found no difference  Later  other researchers measured the density differential and found a significant difference  Modern violins had a greater variation  a larger differential

Student

So you mean the density of the wood in the Cremonese violins is  is more uniform

Professor

Correct

Student

But Northern Italy isn t in the tropics

Professor

No  But climate matters  Turns out the Cremonese violins were made from trees that grew during a Little Ice Age  a period when temperatures across Europe were significantly lower than normal  So the trees grew more evenly throughout the year  making the density differential relatively small

Student

But you said someone replicated the Cremonese wood

Professor

The density differential was replicated

Student

What did they do  Try to simulate an Ice Age climate in their greenhouse and grow some trees in there

Professor

No  what happened was a material scientist figured out a way to process wood to make it acoustically similar to the Cremonese wood  He basically exposed the wood to a species of fungus  uh  a mushroom  In the forest  fungi are decomposers  They break down dead wood  But this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood  leaving other layers alone  As a result  the density differential of the fungi treated wood approach that of the Cremonese wood
