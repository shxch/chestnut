Speciation in Geographically Isolated Populations

Evolutionary biologists believe that speciation  the formation of a new species  often begins when some kind of physical barrier arises and divides a population of a single species into separate subpopulations  Physical separation between subpopulations promotes the formation of new species because once the members of one subpopulation can no longer mate with members of another subpopulation  they cannot exchange variant genes that arise in one of the subpopulations  In the absence of gene flow between the subpopulations  genetic differences between the groups begin to accumulate  Eventually the subpopulations become so genetically distinct that they cannot interbreed even if the physical barriers between them were removed  At this point the subpopulations have evolved into distinct species  This route to speciation is known as allopatry   allo   means  different   and  patria  means  homeland
Allopatric speciation may be the main speciation route  This should not be surprising  since allopatry is pretty common  In general  the subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance  So even under normal situations the gene flow among the subpopulations is more of an intermittent trickle than a steady stream  In addition  barriers can rapidly arise and shut off the trickle  For example  in the 1800s a monstrous earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River  a large river flowing in the central part of the United States of America  The change separated populations of insects now living along opposite shore  completely cutting off gene flow between them
Geographic isolation also can proceed slowly  over great spans of time  We find evidence of such extended events in the fossil record  which affords glimpses into the breakup of formerly continuous environments  For example  during past ice ages  glaciers advanced down through North America and Europe and gradually cut off parts of populations from one another  When the glaciers retreated  the separated populations of plants and animals came into contact again  Some groups that had descended from the same parent population were no longer reproductively compatible  they had evolved into separate species  In other groups  however  genetic divergences had not proceeded so far  and the descendants could still interbreed  for them  reproductive isolation was not completed  and so speciation had not occurred
Allopatric speciation can also be brought by the imperceptibly slow but colossal movements of the tectonic plates that make up Earth s surface  About 5 million years ago such geologic movements created the land bridge between North America and South America that we call the Isthmus of Panama  The formation of the isthmus had important consequences for global patterns of ocean water flow  While previously the gap between the continents had allowed a free flow of water  now the isthmus presented a barrier that divided the Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean  This division set the stage for allopatric speciation among populations of fishes and other marine species
In the 1980s  John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes  one population from the Atlantic side of isthmus  the other from the Pacific side  He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each population  Graves found that all four Pacific enzymes function better at lower temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes  This is significant because Pacific seawater is typically 2 to 3 degrees cooler than seawater on the Atlantic side of isthmus  Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed slight differences in amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the four pairs  This is significant because the amino acid sequence of an enzyme is determined by genes
Graves drew two conclusions from these observations  First  at least some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and Pacific fish populations were not random but were the result of evolutionary adaptation  Second  it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the isthmus are starting to genetically diverge from each other  Because Graves s study of geographically isolated populations of isthmus fishes offers a glimpse of the beginning of a process of gradual accumulation of mutations that are neutral or adaptive  divergences here might be evidence of allopatric speciation in process

2  According to paragraph 1  allopatric speciation involves which of the following
 The division of a population into subspecies
 The reuniting of separated populations after they have become distinct species
 The movement of a population to a new homeland
 The absence of gene flow between subpopulations


3  Why does the author provide the information that  the subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance
 To indicate how scientists are able to determine whether subpopulations of a species are allopathic
 To define what it means for a group of animals or plants to be a subpopulation
 To suggest that allopathic speciation is not the only route to speciation
 To help explain why allopatric speciation is a common way for new species to come about
4  The word  accumulate  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Become more significant
 Occur randomly
 Gradually increase in number
 Cause changes
5  In paragraph 2  why does the author mention that some insect populations were separated from each other by a change in the course of Mississippi River caused by an earthquake
 To make the point that some kind of physical barrier separates the subpopulations of most species
 To support the claim that the condition of allopatry can sometimes arise in a short time
 To provide an example of a situation in which gene flow among the subpopulations of a species happens at a slow rate
 To explain insects living along opposite shores of the Mississippi River are very different from each other



6  According to paragraph 3  separation of subpopulations by glaciers resulted in speciation in those groups of plants and animals that
 were reproductively isolated even after the glaciers disappeared
 had adjusted to the old conditions caused by the glaciers
 were able to survive being separated from their parent population
 had experienced some genetic divergences from their parent population

8  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of the geologic movements that brought about the Isthmus of Panama
 The movement brought populations of certain fishes and marine organisms into contact with one another for the first time
 The movement transferred populations of fishes and other marine animals between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
 The movement created conditions that allowed water to flow more freely between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
 The movement created conditions for the formation of new species of fished and other marine animals

 quality
 order
 function
 number

10  According to paragraph 5  by comparing the enzymes from two related groups of fishes on opposite sides of the Isthmus  Graves found evidence that
 there were slight genetic divergences between the two groups
 the Atlantic group of fishes were descended from the Pacific group of fishes
 the temperature of water on either side of the Isthmus had changed
 genetic changes in the Atlantic group of fishes were more rapid and frequent than in the Pacific group of fishes


11  It can be inferred from paragraph 5 and 6 that the reason Graves concluded that some of the differences between the Pacific and Atlantic enzymes were not random was that
 each of the Pacific enzymes works better in cooler waters
 the Enzymes of the Atlantic fish populations had not changed since the formation of the Isthmus of Panama
 gel electrophoresis showed that the changes benefited both the Atlantic and the Pacific fish populations
 the differences between the enzymes disappeared when the two fish populations were experimentally switched to other side of the isthmus

Answer Choices

 Allopatric speciation is common because the gene flow between subpopulations is generally limited and the barriers that completely separate subpopulations can arise in a variety of ways
 During past ice ages  some  but not all  subpopulations separated by glaciers evolved into distinct species
 Speciation does not need to take place through allopatry because subpopulations will form distinct species whenever there are adaptive advantage to not
 Physical barriers from glaciers and the movement of tectonic plates form so slowly that the subpopulations on either side of the barriers usually do not form distinct species
 Graves s study of fish populations separately by the Isthmus of Panama may well provide a picture of the beginning stages of speciation
 Graves s study of physically separated fish populations show that there must be large differences between the environments of the isolated populations if allopatric speciation is to take place
