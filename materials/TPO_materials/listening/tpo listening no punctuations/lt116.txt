Let s get started  Um  last time we were talking about the need for advertising  Now  let s look at how you can successfully call attention to the service or product you want to sell  To succeed  you ve got to develop a systematic approach  If you don t come up with a system  um  a plan  you risk making decisions that waste money  or even drive away potential customers

But what
does a systematic advertising plan look like  Well  it covers what we call    the  Four Ms   The  Four Ms   Market  Media  Money  Message  All are important areas to focus on when creating your advertising plan  We will look at them one by one

The First step is to look at your Market  that s the people who might become customers  buyers of your service or product  You need to know all about your possible customers： Who are they？ What age group are they  What do they like  or dislike  How do they shop  So  you got that  A market is a group of potential customers

Next  Media… Obviously the major media are television  radio  newspapers  magazines  um  billboards  and so forth  There are all avenues of communication  And you need to figure out  Which media you should advertise through  Which media will reach your intended audience    your market  So  you do research  trying to determine which media will reach the most potential customers for the lowest cost  For instance  if you have a product  that     oh    say teachers would like  then teachers are your market  So you ask yourself  What magazines do the majority of teachers read  What TV programs do teachers watch  Do teachers listen to much radio  At what times of the day  Say  now your research turns up two magazines that teachers read  And it also shows that the majority of teachers   say ages twenty to thirty   read the magazine about classroom activities  While most teachers older than that read the other magazine  the one about  oh  let s say  Educational Psychology   You think your product will appeal most to teachers ages twenty to thirty  so you decide to put your advertisement in their favorite magazine  the one about classroom activities  You don t waste money advertising in the  Educational Psychology  magazine  you know the one that the younger teachers generally don t read  And since you re reaching the majority of the teachers in your target age group  you re probably spending your money well  which bring us to the third M    Money

You have an advertising budget to spend  but how do you to spend it wisely  Again  research is the key  Good research gives you facts  facts that can help you decide  well  as we already mentioned  decide the right market to target  and the best media to use  But also  When to advertise  or…or how to get the best rates  Like  maybe you re advertising Sports equipment  and you have been spending most of your budget during the holiday season when people buy gifts for each other  Now  in theory  that would seem a great time to advertise  but maybe research shows that you re wrong  that the customers who buy sports equipment tend not to give it as a holiday gift  but want to use it themselves  In that case  advertising during a different season of the year might give you better results  And  um  maybe at even lower  non holiday rates  so you actually save money  But you need to get the facts  facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that you re getting your money s worth
OK  finally  there is your message  What you want to say about your product  Why buying it will make the customer s life easier  or safer or better somehow  Whatever the message is  make sure you get it right

Let me give you an example of not getting it right  Ha   ha   ha    you are going to love this one  There was this Soup Shop  the soup was really tasty  but there weren t a lot of customers  The owner thought that maybe if they gave something away for free with each purchase  then more people would come buy soup  So they got some cheap socks  and they advertised to give a pair away with each bowl of soup  But  then even fewer people came to the restaurant  Well  you can imagine why  People started to associate the soup with feet  they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet  The advertising message  soup means free socks  was a bad choice  it was a waste of money  And worse  it caused the loss of customers

Now  I want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples  not of good advertising messages  but of truly disastrous ones  Think of real examples or make some up  and talk about the reasons those messages are unsuccessful  And then we ll get back together and share
