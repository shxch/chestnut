Sea Routes to Asia

For centuries, all trade between Europe and Asia took place overland. Caravans laden with goods took months to travel great distances. Then, European explorers discovered sea routes to Asia. This was important since traveling by ship was both cheaper and faster to transport goods.

The Portuguese were the first to discover a sea route to Asia. They sailed south around Africa. Then, they entered the Indian Ocean and sailed north to India. Their ships returned to Europe with spices, silks, ivory, gems, and other goods. These voyages took months to complete. But they were still faster than land routes.

There were risks though. The ships could sink in storms. And pirates sometimes captured the ships. But the profits were enormous. Merchants and other wealthy individuals invested in sea trade. They were constantly looking for faster routes to Asia. This set the stage for Christopher Columbus to discover America in 1492.
