Questions 11-17 are about the following story. 
Cricket—how I detested this game when I was young! My family would spend hours and 
hours watching it on television while I angrily waited for it to end. Every game seemed the 
same. Yes, one team won and the other one lost, but it was always the same game—some 
men pitching a ball, some running back and forth.
Then something happened. I became old enough to start playing cricket myself with 
the other kids in my neighborhood. We found a place to play wherever we could put up a 
wicket. We played on the street, in the backyard—even on the tops of buildings, believe it 
or not! 
I can recall so clearly the sounds of the ball hitting the bat and the quick running feet. I 
can still feel the sun on my face as I played and the bruises and scratches from falling down. 
I can still see the blue sky fading to darkness behind the buildings as our games continued 
into the night. It became my favorite thing in the world. Now I watch it not with anger, but 
with fond memories of the endless days and nights spent playing the game.
