Geothermal Energy

    Earth s internal heat  fueled by radioactivity  provides the energy for plate tectonics and continental drift  mountain building  and earthquakes  It can also be harnessed to drive electric generators and heat homes  Geothermal energy becomes available in a practical form when underground heat is transferred by water that is heated as it passes through a subsurface region of hot rocks  a heat reservoir  that may be hundreds or thousands of feet deep  The water is usually naturally occurring groundwater that seeps down along fractures in the rock  less typically  the water is artificially introduced by being pumped down from the surface  The water is brought to the surface  as a liquid or steam  through holes drilled for the purpose
By far the most abundant form of geothermal energy occurs at the relatively low temperatures of 80°to 180°centigrade  Water circulated through heat reservoirs in this temperature range is able to extract enough heat to warm residential  commercial  and industrial spaces  More than 20 000 apartments in France are now heated by warm underground water drawn from a heat reservoir in a geologic structure near Paris called the Paris Basin  Iceland sits on a volcanic structure known as the Mid Atlantic Ridge  Reykjavik  the capital of Iceland  is entirely heated by geothermal energy derived from volcanic heat
Geothermal reservoirs with temperatures above 180°centigrade are useful for generating electricity  They occur primarily in regions of recent volcanic activity as hot  dry rock  natural hot water  or natural steam  The latter two sources are limited to those few areas where surface water seeps down through underground faults or fractures to reach deep rocks heated by the recent activity of molten rock material  The world s largest supply of natural steam occurs at The Geysers  120 kilometers north of San Francisco  California  In the 1990s enough electricity to meet about half the needs of San Francisco was being generated there  This facility was then in its third decade of production and was beginning to show signs of decline  perhaps because of over development  By the late 1990s some 70 geothermal electric generating plants were in operation in California  Utah  Nevada  and Hawaii  generating enough power to supply about a million people  Eighteen countries now generate electricity using geothermal heat
Extracting heat from very hot  dry rocks presents a more difficult problem  the rocks must be fractured to permit the circulation of water  and the water must be provided artificially  The rocks are fractured by water pumped down at very high pressures  Experiments are under way to develop technologies for exploiting this resource
Like most other energy sources  geothermal energy presents some environmental problems  The surface of the ground can sink if hot groundwater is withdrawn without being replaced  In addition  water heated geothermally can contain salts and toxic materials dissolved from the hot rock  These waters present a disposal problem if they are not returned to the ground from which they were removed
The contribution of geothermal energy to the world s energy future is difficult to estimate  Geothermal energy is in a sense not renewable  because in most cases the heat would be drawn out of a reservoir much more rapidly than it would be replaced by the very slow geological processes by which heat flows through solid rock into a heat reservoir  However  in many places  for example  California  Hawaii  the Philippines  Japan  Mexico  the rift valleys of Africa  the resource is potentially so large that its future will depend on the economics of production  At present  we can make efficient use of only naturally occurring hot water or steam deposits  Although the potential is enormous  it is likely that in the near future geothermal energy can make important local contributions only where the resource is close to the user and the economics are favorable  as they are in California  New Zealand  and Iceland  Geothermal energy probably will not make large scale contributions to the world energy budget until well into the twenty first century  if ever



1  According to the processes described in paragraph 1  what is the relationship between radioactivity and the steam produced by geothermal heat
 Geothermally heated steam is produced when water is exposed to radioactivity deep underground
 When water is introduced into holes drilled thousands of feet in the ground  it becomes radioactive and turns to steam
 Radioactivity heats Earth s interior rock  which in turn can heat water to the point it becomes steam
 When a reservoir of steam in subsurface rock is produced by radioactivity  it is said to be geothermally heated

4  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is true about heat reservoirs with a temperature in the range of 80°to 180°centigrade
 They are under international control
 They are more common than reservoirs that have a higher temperature
 Few of them produce enough heat to warm large industrial spaces
 They are used to generate electricity



5  According to paragraph 3  what is the connection between underground faults and naturally occurring steam
 Underground faults enable the heat from molten rock material to escape upward to regions where it can heat surface water enough to produce steam
 Underground faults are created by steam that is produced in geothermal reservoirs deep inside Earth
 Underground faults create spaces in which natural steam is sometimes trapped
 Underground faults allow surface water to reach deep rocks that are hot enough to turn it into steam

6  In paragraph 3  why does the author mention that in the 1990s The Geysers was in its third decade of production
 To provide the historical context of the geothermal production of electricity in the United States
 To imply that The Geysers was the first geothermal site to be put into production in California
 To help explain the signs of decline shown by The Geysers
 To explain why 70 new geothermal sites were put into electricity production in the late 1990s

7  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about geothermal reservoirs
 Volcanic heat is associated only with geothermal reservoirs that have a temperature over 180°centigrade
 More countries produce power from geothermal reservoirs than use them for heating buildings
 Most geothermal reservoirs are suitable for producing electricity
 A higher geothermal reservoir temperature is needed to generate electricity than is needed to heat homes


8  According to paragraph 4  extracting heat from very hot  dry rocks is difficult in part because
 the underground rock must be fractured before heat can be removed from it
 the water above the rock is under very high pressure
 the rock breaks apart when water is pumped into it
 the water circulated through the rock must be much cooler than the rock itself

10  How is the problem that the surface may sink related to the problem that water heated geothermally may contain toxic materials
 Both problems could be solved by returning groundwater that is removed from an underground heat reservoir back to the reservoir after heat is extracted from it
 The problem of sinking is more difficult to solve than is the problem of toxic materials
 Land at the surface sinks because the rock beneath the surface is weakened when salts and toxic materials are removed from it in the process of extracting geothermal energy
 Both problems are caused by the fact that the hot groundwater in a heat reservoir dissolves the rock  which weakens the rock and makes the water toxic with salt



11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Heat flows through solid rock very slowly  so it takes a very long time for geological processes to produce a reservoir of geothermal energy
 Geothermal energy is not renewable because heat flows very slowly through solid rock into or out of a heat reservoir
 The heat quickly removed from a heat reservoir is replaced so slowly by geological processes that geothermal energy is not practically speaking  renewable
 In most cases  heat travels into a heat reservoir so slowly that it is a much quicker process to remove the heat from a reservoir than to replace it

12  In paragraph 6  the author implies that in California  Hawaii  the Philippines  Japan  Mexico  and the rift valleys of Africa the potential size of the geothermal resource is so large that
 it might be economically worth developing these sites even though geothermal energy is not renewable
 these sites will be the first geothermal energy sites to be developed with new technology
 these sites are likely to make a large scale contribution to the world energy budget in the twenty first century
 it does not matter whether they have naturally occurring deposits of hot water or steam

Heat reservoirs in the form of hot rock far beneath Earth s surface are a potential source of usable geothermal energy




Answer Choices

 Heat reservoirs with a temperature from 80°to 180°centigrade can be used  as in France and Iceland  to heat buildings
 A number of countries now use geothermal reservoirs that contain water or steam above 180°centigrade to generate electricity
 Most heat reservoirs with a temperature above 180°centigrade cannot be used for energy because they are usually too close to recent volcanic activity
 The sinking of land above heat reservoirs and other environmental problems arise when water is pumped into a heat reservoir under high pressure
 Experiments are under way to determine if geothermally heated waters could be used as a source of certain minerals that have been dissolved out of hot rocks deep within Earth
 A number of issues  including how to extract heat from reservoirs that do not have a natural supply of water  will significantly limit the use of geothermal energy for the foreseeable future
