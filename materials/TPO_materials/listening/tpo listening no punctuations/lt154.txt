Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her biology professor

Professor
Hi Samantha  how did your track meet go
Samantha
Great  I placed first in one race and third in another
Professor
Congratulations   You must practice a lot
Samantha
Three times a week pre season  but now that we re competing every weekend  we practice 6 days a week from 3 30 till 5 00
Professor
Athletics place a heavy demand on your time  don   t they
Samantha
Yeah  but I really love competing  so …
Professor
You know I played soccer in college and my biggest challenge  and I didn t always succeed  was getting my studying in during soccer season  Are you having a similar …
Samantha
No  I … I really do make time to study  And I actually study more for this class than I do for all my other classes  But I didn   t see the grade I expected on my mid term exam  which is why I came by
Professor
Well  you didn t do badly on the exam  but I agree it did not reflect your potential  I say this because your work on the lab project was exemplary  I was so impressed with the way you handle the microscope and the samples of onion cells  and with how carefully you observed and diagramed and interpreted each stage of cell division  And I don t think you could have done that if you hadn t read and understood the chapter  I mean it seemed like you really had a good understanding of it
Samantha
I thought so too  but I missed some questions about cell division on the
exam
Professor
So what happened
Samantha
I just sort of blanked out  I guess  I had a hard time remembering details
It was so frustrating
Professor
Alright  let s back up  You say you studied  where  at home
Samantha
At my kitchen table actually
Professor
And that s supposed to be a quiet environment
Samantha
Not exactly  My brother and parents try to keep it down when I am studying  but the phone pretty much rings off the hook  so …
Professor
So you might try a place with fewer distractions  like the library …
Samantha
But the library closes at mid night  and I like to study all night before a test  you know  so everything is fresh in my mind  I studied six straight hours the night before the mid term exam   That   s why I expected to do so much better
Professor
Oh ok  You know that studying six consecutive hours is not equivalent to studying one hour a day for six days
Samantha
It isn t
Professor
No  There is research that shows that after about an hour of intense focus  your brain needs a break  It needs to  you know  shift gears a little  Your brain s ability to absorb information starts to decline after about the first hour  So if you are dealing with a lot of new concepts and vocabulary  anyway  if you just review your notes  even 20 minutes a day  it d be much better than waiting until the night before an exam to try and absorb all those details
Samantha
Oh  I didn t realize
Professor
Think of your brain as a muscle  If you didn t practice regularly with your track team  and then tried to squeeze in three weeks worth of running practice the day before a track meet  how well do you think you d perform in your races
