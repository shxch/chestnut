In order to really study the social history of the Middle Ages  you have to understand the role of spices  Now  this might sound a little spurring  even a little strange  But what seem like little things now were back then actually rather big things  So first let s define what a spice is  Technically speaking  a spice is part of an aromatic plant that is not a leaf or herb  Spices can come from tree bark like cinnamon  plant roots like ginger  flower buds like cloves  And in the Middle Ages  Europeans were familiar with lots of different spices  most important being pepper  cloves  ginger  cinnamon  maize and nutmeg  These spices literarily dominated the way Europeans lived for centuries  how they traded and even how they used their imaginations  So why this medieval fascination with spices  We can boil it down to there general ideas briefly  One was cost and rarity  Uh two was exotic taste and fragrance  And third  mysterious origins and kinds of mythical status  Now for cost and rarity  spices aren t native to Europe and they had to be imported  Spices only grew in the East Indies and of course transportation costs were incredibly valuable even from the very beginning  Here is an example  In 408 AD  the Gothic General who captured Rome demanded payment  He wanted 5000 pounds of gold among other things but he also wanted 3000 pounds of pepper  Maybe that would give you an idea of exactly where pepper stood at the time  By the Middle Ages  spices were regarded as so important and expensive they were used in diplomacy  as gifts by heads of state and ambassadors  Now for the taste  The diet then was relatively bland  compared to today s  There wasn t much variety  Especially the aristocracy who tended to eat a lot of meat  they were always looking for new ways to prepare it  new sources  new tastes and this is where spices came in  Now  this is a good point to mention one of the biggest myths about spices  It s commonly said that medieval Europeans wanted spices to cover up the taste of spoiled meat  But this isn t really true  Anyone who had to worry about spoiled meat couldn t afford spices in the first place  If you could afford spices  you could definitely afford fresh meat  We also have evidence that various medieval markets employed a kind of police to make sure that people did not sell spoiled food  and if you were caught doing it  you were subject to various fines  humiliating public punishments  So what actually was true was this  In order to have meat for the winter  people would preserve it in salt  not a spice  Spices actually aren t very effective as preservatives  And throughout winter  they would eat salted meat  but the taste of the stuff could grow really boring and depressing after a while  So the cook started looking for new ways to improve the taste and spices were the answer  which brings us to mysterious origins and mythical status  Now the ancient Romans had a thriving spice trade and they sent their ships to the east and back  But when Rome collapsed in the fifth century and the Middle Ages began  direct trade stopped  and so did that kind of hands on knowledge of travel and geography  Spices now came by way of the trade routes with lots of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer  So these spices took on an air of mystery  Their origins were shrouded in exotic travels  They had the allure of the unknown  of wild places  Myths grew up of fantasy lands  magical faraway places made entirely of food and spices  And to that  spices themselves had always been considered special or magical not just for eating and this was already true in the ancient world where legends about spices were abundant  Spices inspired the medieval imagination  They were used as medicines to ward off diseases  and mixed into perfumes  incent  They were used in religious rituals for thousands of years  They took on a life of their own and they inspired the medieval imagination  spurred on the age of discovery in the 145th and 16th centuries  When famous explorers like Columbus and da Gama and Magellan left Europe in their ships  they weren t looking for a new world   they were looking for spices  And we know what important historical repercussions some of those voyages had
