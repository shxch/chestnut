Conversation 1

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and the librarian employee

Student
Hi  I am looking for this book   the American judicial system  And I can t seem to find it anywhere  I need to read a chapter for my political science class

Librarian
Let me check in the computer  Um… doesn t seem to be checked out and it s not on reserve  You ve checked the shelves I assume

Student
Yeah  I even checked other shelves and tables next to where the book should be

Librarian

Well  it s still here in the library  So people must be using it  You know this seems to be a very popular book tonight  We show six copies  None are checked out  And  yet you didn t even find one copy on the shelves  Is it a big class

Student
Maybe about Seventy Five

Librarian
Well  you should ask your professor to put some of the copies on reserve  You know about the  Reserve system   right

Student
I know that you have to read reserve books in the library and that you have time limits  But I didn t know that I could ask a professor to put a book on reserve  I mean I thought the professors make that kind of decisions at the beginning of the semester

Librarian
Oh… they can put books on reserve at anytime during the semester

Student
You know reserving book seems a bit unfair  What if someone who is not in the class wants to use the book

Librarian
That s why I said some copies

Student
Ah  well  I ll certainly talk to my professor about it tomorrow  But what I am gonna do tonight

Librarian
I guess you could walk around the Poli Sci  Political Science  section and look at the books waiting to be re shelved

Student
There do seem to be more than normal

Librarian
We are a little short staffed right now  Someone quit recently  so things aren t getting re shelved as quickly as usual  I don t think they ve hired a replacement yet  so  yeah  the un shelved books can get a bit out of hand

Student
This may sound a bit weird  But I ve been thinking about getting a job  Um… I ve never worked in a library before  But…

Librarian
That s not a requirement  The job might still be open  At the beginning of the semester we were swamped with applications  but I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now

Student
What can you tell me about the job

Librarian
Well  we work between six and ten hours a week  so it s a reasonable amount  Usually we can pick the hours we want to work  But since you d be starting so late in the semester  I m not sure how that would work for you  And… Oh… we get paid the normal university rates for student employees

Student
So who do I talk to

Librarian
I guess you talk to Dr  Jenkins  the head librarian  She does the hiring
