Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his art history professor

Professor
How was the museum

Student
Great  I hadn t been there for a few years

Professor
Did you enjoy the Van Gogh painting

Student
That s the thing  Looks like I have to change my topic

Professor
Hmm… we are getting close to the deadline  You were writing about the theme of night in the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh
It s a wonderful topic

Student
I know  People don t usually think of Van Gogh as an artist of nocturnal themes  They think of brightness  sunshine  all that yellow and orange

Professor
You are right of course about the intense light associated with his daytime paintings  But his night paintings don t exactly lack brightness

Student
That s the paradox that I really like  the paradox of painting a nighttime scene using so much color and light  So I was planning to focus mostly on his painting Starry Night

Professor
But

Student
When I went to the museum to look at the actual painting  like you told me to  It wasn t there

Professor
Really  Isn t it part of the permanent collection

Student
Yes  But it s on loan right now to a museum in Europe

Professor
Ah  I see  Well  I am strict about having students write about paintings they can observe firsthand

Student
Well  I found another painting I could study instead

Professor
OK

Student
I read that there are two paintings called Starry Night  The first one was done by the French realist painter Millet  It may have been the inspiration for Van Gogh s painting  Millet s painting is located near my family s house in Connecticut  And I am going there this weekend and could study it then  I made sure it s not out on loan

Professor
That definitely would work then  Van Gogh copied many of Millet s compositions  We know that he really admired Millet s work  And a lot of us think Van Gogh saw this particular painting by Millet in Paris in the late 1700s

Student
Yeah  Although Millet was a realist painter  and Van Gogh a post impressionist  the two paintings still share lots of features  not just the name  The most striking shared feature has got to be the amazing light effects  I am excited to go see it  But one other thing …

Professor
Uh huh

Student
I was thinking about getting a head start on my next assignment while I am at the gallery in Connecticut  the assignment on miniatures  They have a lot of miniature portraits of children as part of their permanent collection

Professor
American miniatures

Student
Yeah  So I figured I could also get started on that essay  study a few while I am there  I d focus on the meaning of the objects that some of the children are holding  some are holding flowers  one child has a rattle  another a toy violin…

Professor
That would be fine  Uh  those objects…we call them attributes  The attributes chosen to be included in a particular miniature was often meant to communicate parents  hopes and dreams for their child  So I think you ll learn a lot about how people viewed children at the time the miniature paintings were done
