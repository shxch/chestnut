Maya Water Problems

To understand the ancient Mayan people who lived in the area that is today southern Mexico and Central America and the ecological difficulties they faced  one must first consider their environment  which we think of as  jungle  or  tropical rainforest   This view is inaccurate  and the reason proves to be important  Properly speaking  tropical rainforests grow in high rainfall equatorial areas that remain wet or humid all year round  But the Maya homeland lies more than sixteen hundred kilometers from the equator  at latitudes 17 to 22 degrees north  in a habitat termed a  seasonal tropical forest   That is  while there does tend to be a rainy season from May to October  there is also a dry season from January through April  If one focuses on the wet months  one calls the Maya homeland a  seasonal tropical forest   if one focuses on the dry months  one could instead describe it as a  seasonal desert

From north to south in the Yucatan Peninsula  where the Maya lived  rainfall ranges from 18 to 100 inches  457 to 2 540 millimeters  per year  and the soils become thicker  so that the southern peninsula was agriculturally more productive and supported denser populations  But rainfall in the Maya homeland is unpredictably variable between years  some recent years have had three or four times more rain than other years  As a result  modern farmers attempting to grow corn in the ancient Maya homelands have faced frequent crop failures  especially in the north  The ancient Maya were presumably more experienced and did better  but nevertheless they too must have faced risks of crop failures from droughts and hurricanes

Although southern Maya areas received more rainfall than northern areas  problems of water were paradoxically more severe in the wet south  While that made things hard for ancient Maya living in the south  it has also made things hard for modern archaeologists who have difficulty understanding why ancient droughts caused bigger problems in the wet south than in the dry north  The likely explanation is that an area of underground freshwater underlies the Yucatan Peninsula  but surface elevation increases from north to south  so that as one moves south the land surface lies increasingly higher above the water table  In the northern peninsula the elevation is sufficiently low that the ancient Maya were able to reach the water table at deep sinkholes called cenotes  or at deep caves  In low elevation north coastal areas without sinkholes  the Maya would have been able to get down to the water table by digging wells up to 75 feet  22 meters  deep  But much of the south lies too high above the water table for cenotes or wells to reach down to it  Making matters worse  most of the Yucatan Peninsula consists of karst  a porous sponge like limestone terrain where rain runs straight into the ground and where little or no surface water remains available

How did those dense southern Maya populations deal with the resulting water problem  It initially surprises us that many of their cities were not built next to the rivers but instead on high terrain in rolling uplands  The explanation is that the Maya excavated depressions  or modified natural depressions  and then plugged up leaks in the karst by plastering the bottoms of the depressions in order to create reservoirs  which collected rain from large plastered catchment basins and stored it for use in the dry season  For example  reservoirs at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet the drinking water needs of about 10 000 people for a period of 18 months  At the city of Coba the Maya built dikes around a lake in order to raise its level and make their water supply more reliable  But the inhabitants of Tikal and other cities dependent on reservoirs for drinking water would still have been in deep trouble if 18 months passed without rain in a prolonged drought  A shorter drought in which they exhausted their stored food supplies might already have gotten them in deep trouble  because growing crops required rain rather than reservoirs




1  Why does the author call the Mayan homeland both a  seasonal tropical forest  and  seasonal desert
 To illustrate how the climate of the Mayan homeland varied from region to region
 To explain how the climate of the Mayan homeland is similar to that of a jungle or tropical rainforest
 To emphasize the vast size of the area that comprised the Mayan homeland in ancient times
 To make the point that the Mayan homeland is climatically more complex than is generally assumed



2  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a difference between the northern and southern Yucatan Peninsula
 The annual rainfall was greater in the south
 The population density was lower in the north
 Agricultural productivity was greater in the south
 Rainfall was more unpredictable and variable in the south

3  Which of the following statements about ancient and modem agriculture in the Yucatan Peninsula is supported by paragraph 2
 Modern agricultural methods have solved many of the ancient problems of farming in the Yucatan Peninsula
 Ancient Mayan farmers may have been somewhat more successful at farming in the Yucatan Peninsula than farmers are today
 Farming today is easier than in the past because environmental changes in the Yucatan Peninsula have increased available rainfall
 The Yucatan soils in which ancient farmers worked were richer  more productive  and thicker than they are today





4  The word  paradoxically  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 usually
 surprisingly
 understandably
 predictably

5  The phrase  The likely explanation  in the passage refers to the explanation for why
 the southern Maya areas received more rainfall than the northern areas
 modern archaeologists have difficulty understanding ancient droughts
 water problems were most severe in the wet south
 land surface in the south is so high above the water table

6  Which of the following statements about the availability of water in the Mayan homeland is supported by paragraph 3
 The construction of wells was an uncommon practice in both the north and the south because it was too difficult to dig through the karst
 In most areas in the north and the south  rainwater was absorbed directly into the porous karst
 The water table was an important resource for agriculture in both the north and the south of the Yucatan Peninsula
 The lack of surface water in both the north and the south was probably due to the fact that most of it was quickly used up for agricultural purposes

7  According to paragraph 3  why was the southern Mayan homeland hard to farm
 The presence of numerous sinkholes and wells interfered with farming
 Southern soil lacked the depth crops needed for growth
 Underground water was too far below the surface to reach
 The presence of karst caused frequent flooding










8 Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Southern Maya populations obtained the water they needed for the dry season by collecting and storing rainwater in sealed depressions
 The Maya are credited with creating methods for modifying natural rainwater and storing it
 Leaks in the karst caused difficulties in the creation of reservoirs  which were needed to store water for the dry season
 Southern Mayans were more successful at collecting rain than storing it during dry seasons

9  What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about how residents of Tikal met their needs for water and food during most periods of drought
 They depended upon water and food that had been stored for use during the dry season
 They obtained drinking water and water for crop irrigation from Coba dikes
 They located their population centers near a lake where water was available for drinking and watering crops
 They moved locations every 18 months to find new croplands and water sources

10  The word  prolonged  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unusual
 unexpected
 extended
 disastrous

11  The word  exhausted  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 used up
 reduced
 wasted
 relied upon

The difference between the two climates challenged the Maya who had to deal with both
Where would the sentence best fit
