TPO 14 Lecture 4 Archeology

Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class

Professor
When we think of large monumental structures built by early societies  an Egyptian pyramid probably comes to mind  But there are some even earlier structures in the British Isles also worth discussing  and besides the well known circle of massive stones of Stonehenge  which don t get me wrong is remarkable enough  well  other impressive Neolithic structures are found there too  Oh  yes  we are talking about the Neolithic period here  also called new Stone Age  which was the time before stone tools began to be replaced by tools made of bronze and other metals  It was about 5000 years ago  even before the first Egyptian pyramid that some amazing Neolithic monuments   tombs  were erected at various sites around Ireland  Great Britain and coastal islands nearby
I am referring particular to structures that in some cases  look like ordinary natural hills but were definitely built by humans  well organized communities of humans to enclose a chamber or room within stone walls and sometimes with a high  cleverly designed ceiling of overlapping stones  These structures are called Passage Graves  because the inner chamber  sometimes several chambers in fact  could only be entered from the outside through a narrow passageway

Michael
Excuse me  professor  but you said Passage Graves  Were these just monuments to honor the dead buried there or were they designed to be used somehow by the living

Professor
Ah  yes  Good question  Michael  Besides being built as tombs  some of these Passage Graves were definitely what we might call Astronomical Calendars  with chambers that were flooded with sunlight on certain special days of the year  which must ve have seemed miraculous and inspired a good deal of religious wonder  But research indicates that not just light but also the physics of sound helped enhance
this religious experiences

Michael
How so

Professor
Well  first the echoes  When a religious leader started chanting with echoes bouncing off the stonewalls over and over again  it must ve seemed like a whole chorus of other voices  spirits of Gods maybe  joining in

But even more intriguing is what physicists called
Standing Waves  Basically  the phenomenon of Standing Waves occurs when sound waves of the same frequency reflect off the walls and meet from opposite directions  So  the volume seems to alternate between very loud and very soft  You can stand quite near a man singing in loud voice and hardly hear him  Yet step a little further away and his voice is almost deafening  As you move around the chamber  the volume of the sound goes way up and way down  depending on where you are in these standing waves  And often the acoustics make it hard to identify where sounds are coming from  It s as if powerful voices are speaking to you or chanting from inside your own head  This had to engender a powerful sense of awe in Neolithic worshipers

And another bit of physics at play here is something called Resonance  I am no physicist  but well I imagine you have all blown air over the top of an empty bottle and heard the sound it makes  And you ve probably noticed that depending on its size    each empty bottle plays one particular musical note  Or as a physicist might put it  each bottle resonates at a particular frequency  Well  that s true of these chambers too  If you make a constant noise inside the chamber  maybe by steadily beating drum at a certain rate  a particular frequency of sound will resonate  will ring out intensely  depending on the size of the chamber  In some of the larger chambers though  these intensified sound may be too deep for us to hear  we can feel it  We are mysteriously agitated by itâ€¦ but it is not a sound our ears can hear

The psychological effects of all these extraordinary sounds can be profound  especially when they seem so disconnected from the human doing the drumming or chanting  And there can be observable physical effects on people too  In fact  the sounds can cause headaches  feelings of dizziness  increased heart rate  that sort of thing  you see  Anyway  what was experienced inside one of these Passage Graves clearly could be far more intense than the everyday reality outside  which made them very special places

But back to your question  Michael  as to whether these Graves were designed to be used by the living  Well  certainly  with regard to astronomical or calendar function  That seems pretty obvious  and I wanna go into more detail on that now
