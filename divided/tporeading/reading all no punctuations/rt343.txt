Protection of Plants by Insects
       Many plants   one or more species of at least 68 different families   can secrete nectar even when they have no blossoms  because they bear extrafloral nectaries  structures that produce nectar  on stems  leaves  leaf stems  or other structures  These plants usually occur where ants are abundant  most in the tropics but some in temperate areas  Among those of northeastern North America are various plums  cherries  roses  hawthorns  poplars  and oaks  Like floral nectar  extrafloral nectar consists mainly of water with a high content of dissolved sugars and  in some plants  small amounts of amino acids  The extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to attract ants and other insects  but the evolutionary history of most plants with these nectaries is unknown  Nevertheless  most ecologists believe that all extrafloral nectaries attract insects that will defend the plant

     Ants are portably the most frequent and certainly the most persistent defenders of plants  Since the highly active worker ants require a great deal of energy  plants exploit this need by providing extrafloral nectar that supplies ants with abundant energy  To return this favor  ants guard the nectaries  driving away or killing intruding insects that might compete with ants for nectar  Many of these intruders are herbivorous and would eat the leaves of the plants

      Biologists once thought that secretion of extrafloral nectar has some purely internal physiological function  and that ants provide no benefit whatsoever to the plants that secrete it  This view and the opposing  protectionist  hypothesis that ants defend plants had been disputed for over a hundred years when  in 1910  a skeptical William Morton Wheeler commented on the controversy  He called for proof of the protectionist view  that visitations of the ants confer protection on the plants and that in the absence of the insects a much greater number would perish or fail to produce flowers or seeds than when the insects are present  That we now have an abundance of the proof that was called for was established when Barbara Bentley reviewed the relevant evidence in 1977  and since then many more observations and experiments have provided still further proof that ants benefit plants

     One example shows how ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries protect morning glories against attacking insects  The principal insect enemies of the North American morning glory feed mainly on its flowers or fruits rather than its leaves  Grasshoppers feeding on flowers indirectly block pollination and the production of seeds by destroying the corolla or the stigma  which receives the pollen grains and on which the pollen germinates  Without their colorful corolla  flowers do not attract pollinators and are not fertilized  An adult grasshopper can consume a large corolla  about 2 5 inches long  in an hour  Caterpillars and seed beetles affect seed production directly  Caterpillars devour the ovaries  where the seeds are produced  and seed beetle larvae eat seeds as they burrow in developing fruits

      Extrafloral nectaries at the base of each sepal attract several kinds of insects  but 96 percent of them are ants  several different species of them  When buds are still small  less than a quarter of an inch long  the sepal nectaries are already present and producing nectar  They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures  Observations leave little doubt that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers  caterpillars  and seed beetles  Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants  Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant  but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant  Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers  they drive them away by nipping at their feet  Seed beetles are more vulnerable because they are much smaller than grasshoppers  The ants prey on the adult beetles  disturb females as they lay their eggs on developing fruits  and eat many of the eggs they do manage to lay



1  According to paragraph 1  floral nectar and extrafloral nectar are alike in that
  they are likely to be produced by the same plants
  they basically consist of the same chemical components
  they attract only insects that will defend the plant
  they are produced by the same parts of the plant

2  To say that ants are  persistent  defenders of plants means that
  they defend plants against a wide variety of threats
  they continue to defend plants for as long as the plants are threatened
  they are successful defenders of plants
  they are easily observable defenders of plants

3  What can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the ants that are attracted to the extrafloral nectaries
  They do not eat the leaves of the plants that produce extrafloral nectar
  They live almost entirely on extrafloral nectar
  They spend most of their energy guarding extrafloral nectaries
  They frequently fight among themselves over extrafloral nectar


4  According to paragraph 3  what was the position of the opponents of the  protectionist  hypothesis
  Extrafloral nectar provides plants with a direct defense against attack by insects
  Ants substantially benefit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar
  The secretion of extrafloral nectar plays a role in the plant s internal functioning
  Ants visit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar as often as they visit plants that do not


5  The word  skeptical  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  curious
  doubtful
  open minded
  practical

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  We now have ample proof that ants benefit plants
  Barbara Bentley has called for additional proof that ants benefit plants
  In 1977 Barbara Bentley conducted research that proved that all prior studies were wrong
  Proof that ants benefit plants will require many more observations and experiments


7  According to paragraph 4  what effect does the destruction of the corolla have on plants
  It leaves the seeds exposed and unprotected
  It prevents the stigma from developing
  It keeps pollen grains from attaching properly
  It prevents the flower from attracting pollinators

8  The word  devour  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  attack
  eat
  damage
  prefer






9  What role does paragraph 5 play in the passage
  It offers various kinds of evidence for the protectionist view
  It presents the study that first proved that ants benefit plants
  It explains how insects find sources of nectar
  It presents information that partly contradicts the protectionist view

10  The word  vulnerable  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  numerous
  harmful
  open to attack
  difficult to locate

11  According to paragraph 5  what did Bentley s comparative study show
  Many more plants grew in places where ants were present than where they were absent
  The ants preferred plants with low seed production to plants with high seed production
  The plants occupied by ants produced many more seeds than those that were not occupied by ants
  The plants that grew in places without ants were much smaller and weaker than those that grew in places where ants were present

12  According to paragraph 5  ants defend morning glory plants from seed beetles in each of the following ways EXCEPT
  driving adult beetles off the plants by nipping at their feet
  catching and eating adult beetles
  eating beetle eggs they find on developing fruits
  making it difficult for beetles to lay eggs on developing fruits

13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
 Sometimes they capture the insects to feed their protein hungry larvae
    Where does the sentence best fit
14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This questions is worth 2 points

     Many plants have extrafloral nectaries that produce nectar even during periods in which the plant is not flowering




Answer Choices
  Evolutionary history shows that plants that produce extrafloral nectar originated in the tropics
  Extrafloral nectar has a higher concentration of sugar than floral nectar and is more attractive to ants and other insects
  The protectionist hypothesis is that extrafloral nectar attracts ants  and that the ants  in order to preserve this energy rich food source  attack insects that might harm the plant
  Evidence accumulated during the twentieth century proved that ants provide significant benefits for plants with extrafloral nectaries
  Research has shown that American morning glory plants that are protected by ants produce significantly more seeds than morning glory plants that are not protected by ants
  Ants generally ignore small insects  but they will eat the adults of large insect species as well as their eggs and larvae
