Brazilian Independence

Portuguese explorers first landed in Brazil in 1500. They quickly made it a colony. They developed an economy based on sugar plantations and gold mines. To work in both places, the Portuguese imported slaves from Africa. By the 1800s, the descendants of those slaves had come to think of themselves as Brazilians. Yet Brazil was still a colony of Portugal. In the early 1800s, a series of events occurred. In the end, they led to Brazil gaining its independence. 

In Europe in 1807, a French army of Napoleon's invaded Portugal.  The Portuguese royal family promptly fled to Brazil. There, King John VI declared that Brazil and Portugal were a joint empire. u This made Brazil the equal of Portugal. This pleased the Brazilians. A few years later, in 1815, Napoleon was defeated. In 1821 , the king returned home. He left his son 

Pedro behind to rule Brazil. A little later, the king announced that Brazil had returned to colony status. Many Brazilians were upset. They refused to accept that. So they rebelled. Dom Pedro was ordered home. He refused and remained in Brazil. He became the leader of the rebellion. Brazilian rebels fought the Portuguese. The revolution lasted for almost four years. It was a difficult time. But the Brazilians received some vital aid from Thomas Cochrane. He was a former British naval officer. Cochrane had a small fleet of nine ships. They were enough to let the rebels emerge victorious. Despite losing, Portugal wanted to continue to fight. But the British pressured the king to end the war. In August 1825, the rebellion ended. Brazil, Portugal, and Britain signed a treaty. Brazil became a free country. And Dom Pedro was named the first emperor of Brazil.
