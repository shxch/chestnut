Machu Picchu 

The Inca Empire was a great early American society. It was located in the northern part of South America.    Many of its cities were in the Andes Mountains.   The Incas built a strong empire.   a But they were defeated by Spanish conquistadors looking for gold.   This took place in the 1530s. After the empire's defeat, much about the Incas was forgotten. 

In 1911, archaeologist Hiram Bingham made a great discovery High in the Andes Mountains near Cuzco, Peru, he found the ancient city Machu Picchu. The city had been designed to be impossible to see from below, so no one had been able to discover it until then. Machu Picchu was mostly intact. Its many buildings contained treasures from the past. These included temples, homes, and even an observatory. Thanks to Binghamâ€™s discovery, much has been learned about the Incas.
