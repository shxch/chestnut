Lecture2 Biology  Populations in an Ecosystem
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Student
Professor  since we are going to talk about changes in animal populations in the wild  I d like to ask about somethingI read in an article online  about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species  and how other environmental factors come into play too
Professor
Right  Relationships between animal species in a given ecosystem can get pretty complex  Because in addition to predator prey relationships  there are other variables that affect population size
Student
The article mentioned that populations of predators and their prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden
Student
Oh  Yeah  I read about that in my ecology class  It happens in cycles  I think that s called a boom and bust cycle  Right
Professor
OK  Well  hold on a second  First I want to go over some key concepts  Let s say there was a species that had access to plenty of food and ideal conditions  Under those circumstances  its population would increase exponentially  meaning it would increase at an ever accelerating pace
Student
Wow  That sounds a little scary
Professor
Well  it doesn t usually happen  Like you said  a rapid population growth is often followed by a sudden decline  But we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they are transplanted into a new environment  Um…because they face little competition and have favorable growing conditions
But for most species  most of the time  resources are finite  There s only so much available…which leads me to my point  Every ecosystem has what we call a carrying capacity  The carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by the resources of a particular ecosystem  Resources are  of course  food  water  and just as important  space
Although every species has a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase  assuming ideal conditions for the species in its environment  There are always going to be environmental factors that limit population growth  This is called environmental resistance  Environmental resistance is important becauseit stops populations from growing out of control  Factors such food supply  predation and disease affect population size  and can change from year to year or season to season
Student
OK  I think I get it
Professor
Well  let s look at a case study  That should make things clear  Some years ago  some of my colleagues conducted an experiment in an oak forest involving three different species  white footed mice  gypsy moths and oak trees The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928
OK  Now let me explain what the situation is in this forest  Oak trees produce acorns  and acorns are a primary food source for white footed mice  Another food source for the white footed mice is the gypsy moth  So the size of the gypsy moth population is controlled by the white footed mice  which is a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillars are considered pests  They strip away the leaves from the oak trees every ten years or so
Student
So the mice eat both acorns from the oak trees and gypsy moths  And the gypsy moth caterpillars eat oak tree leaves
Professor
Right  Now  what makes this set of relationships particularly interesting is that oak trees only produce a large number of acorns every few years
Student
So during the years with fewer acorns  the white footed mice have to deal with a smaller food supply
Professor
Yes  But in the years with large amounts of acorns  the mice have more food  which leads to…
Student
The white footed mice population growing
Professor
And the gypsy moth population decreasing
Student
How can we know that for sure  It seems like a big jump from more acorns to fewer gypsy moths
Professor
Well  we can know for sure because in this oak forest  the researchers decided to test the links between acorns and the two animal species  In some parts of the forest  they had volunteers drop a large number of extra acorns on the forest floor  And in another section of the forest  they removed a number of white footed mice  In the forest areas where extra acorns had been dropped  the gypsy moth population soon went into a significant decline  But in the section of the forest where the white footed mice had been removed  the gypsy moth population exploded
