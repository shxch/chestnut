In the late nineteenth century  political and social changes were occurring rapidly in Siam  now Thailand   The old ruling families were being displaced by an evolving centralized government  These families were pensioned off  given a sum of money to live on  or simply had their revenues taken away or restricted  their sons were enticed away to schools for district officers  later to be posted in some faraway province  and the old patron client relations that had bound together local societies simply disintegrated  Local rulers could no longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal cases  and with the ending in 1905 of the practice of forcing peasant farmers to work part time for local rulers  the rulers no longer had a regular base for relations with rural populations  The old local ruling families  then  were severed from their traditional social context

The same situation viewed from the perspective of the rural population is even more complex  According to the government s first census of the rural population  taken in 1905  there were about thirty thousand villages in Siam  This was probably a large increase over the figure even two or three decades earlier  during the late 1800s  It is difficult to imagine it now  but Siam s Central Plain in the late 1800s was nowhere near as densely settled as it is today  There were still forests closely surrounding Bangkok into the last of the nineteenth century  and even at century s end there were wild elephants and tigers roaming the countryside only twenty or thirty miles away

Much population movement involved the opening up of new lands for rice cultivation  Two things made this possible and encouraged it to happen  First  the opening of the kingdom to the full force of international trade by the Boring Treaty  1855  rapidly encouraged economic specialization in the growing of rice  mainly to feed the rice deficient portions of Asia  India and china in particular  The average annual volume of rice exported from Siam grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms per year at the turn of the century  and over the same period the average price per kilogram doubled  During the same period  the area planted in rice increased from about 230 000 acres to more than350  000 acres  This growth was achieved as the result of the collective decisions of thousands of peasants families to expand the amount of land they cultivated  clear and plant new land  or adopt more intensive methods of agriculture

They were able to do so because of our second consideration  They were relatively freer than they had been half a century earlier  Over the course of the Fifth Reign  1868 1910   the ties that bound rural people to the aristocracy and local ruling elites were greatly reduced  Peasants now paid a tax on individuals instead of being required to render labor service to the government  Under these conditions  it made good sense to thousands of peasant families to in effect work full time at what they had been able to do only part time previously because of the requirement to work for the government  grow rice for the marketplace

Numerous changes accompanied these developments  The rural population both dispersed and grew  and was probably less homogeneous and more mobile than it had been a generation earlier  The villages became more vulnerable to arbitrary treatment by government bureaucrats as local elites now had less control over them  By the early twentieth century  as government modernization in a sense caught up with what had been happening in the countryside since the 1870s  the government bureaucracy intruded more and more into village life  Provincial police began to appear  along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds and registration for compulsory military service  Village handicrafts diminished or died out completely as people bought imported consumer goods  like cloth and tools  instead of making them themselves  More economic variation took shape in rural villages  as some grew prosperous from farming while others did not  As well as can be measured  rural standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign  But the statistical averages mean little when measured against the harsh realities of peasant life

14  Prose Summary
During the late nineteenth century  changes in Siam s power structure had important economic consequences

Answer Choices
  Population movement occurred and rice cultivation intensified because Siam became more actively involved in international trade
 Changes in taxation and the ending of the requirement that people work part time for the rulers allowed farmers to produce more rice for the marketplace
  Population increases occurred in part because Siam s farmers were able to produce more rice to feed the population
  Land became so valuable that villagers had to pay the government for the land that they worked on
  Although rural living standards may have improved somewhat  prosperity varied from village to village and government bureaucracy played a greater role in village life
  Government modernization in the early twentieth century resulted in the loss of some freedoms that the rural population had gained from the traditional ruling classes
