Coins
Coins are in constant use today. But coined money was rare centuries ago. Instead, most trade was done by the barter system. People traded one type of good for another. This let them avoid using any kind of money.

But, as kingdoms and empires formed, people began to use money. This often took the form of coins. Coins had several advantages over bartering. They were smaller, weighed less, and were easier to carry than large amounts of trade goods. They could also be used to buy anything. Coins contained precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper. So people understood how much the coins were worth. This made it simple for them to engage in buying and selling. It also increased the popularity of coins. Even today, while paper money and electronic transactions are common, people still use coins in cash transactions.
