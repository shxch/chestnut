Autobiographical Memory
 Think back to your childhood and try to identify your earliest memory  How old were you  Most people are not able to recount memories for experiences prior to the age of three years  a phenomenon called infantile amnesia  The question of why infantile amnesia occurs has intrigued psychologists for decades  especially in light of ample evidence that infants and young children can display impressive memory capabilities  Many find that understanding the general nature of autobiographical memory  that is  memory for events that have occurred in one s own life  can provide some important clues to this mystery  Between ages three and four  children begin to give fairly lengthy and cohesive descriptions of events in their past  What factors are responsible for this developmental turning point
Perhaps the explanation goes back to some ideas raised by influential Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget namely  that children under age two years represent events in a qualitatively different form than older children do  According to this line of thought  the verbal abilities that blossom in the two year old allow events to be coded in a form radically different from the action based codes of the infant  Verbal abilities of one year olds are  in fact  related to their memories for events one year later  When researchers had one year olds imitate an action sequence one year after they first saw it  there was correlation between the children s verbal skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task  However  even children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering the event  thus  memories may be facilitated by but are not dependent on those verbal skills
Another suggestion is that before children can talk about past events in their lives  they need to have a reasonable understanding of the self as a psychological entity  The development of an understanding of the self becomes evident between the first and second years of life and shows rapid elaboration in subsequent years  The realization that the physical self has continuity in time  according to this hypothesis  lays the foundation for the emergence of autobiographical memory
    A third possibility is that children will not be able to tell their own  life story  until they understand something about the general form stories take  that is  the structure of narratives  Knowledge about narratives arises from social interactions  particularly the storytelling that children experience from parents and the attempts parents make to talk with children about past events in their lives  When parents talk with children about  what we did today  or  last week  or  last year   they guide the children s formation of a framework for talking about the past  They also provide children with reminders about the memory and relay the message that memories are valued as part of the cultural experience  It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories than Korean children do  Furthermore  other studies show that Caucasian American mother child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother child pairs  Thus  the types of social experiences children have do factor into the development of autobiographical memories
A final suggestion is that children must begin to develop a  theory of mind  an awareness of the concept of mental states  feelings  desires  beliefs  and thoughts   their own and those of others before they can talk about their own past memories  Once children become capable of answering such questions as  What does it mean to remember   and  What does it mean to know something   improvements in memory seem to occur
   It may be that the developments just described are intertwined with and influence one another  Talking with parents about the past may enhance the development of the self concept  for example  as well as help the child understand what it means to  remember   No doubt the ability to talk about one s past represents memory of a different level of complexity than simple recognition or recall






1  The word  ample  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 surprising
 convincing
 plentiful
 questionable

2  According to paragraph 1  infantile amnesia has intrigued psychologists because
 the ability to recount memories prior to three years of age seems to be connected to intelligence in adulthood
 psychologists do not understand why some people are able to recount memories from before the age of three years  while others are not able do so
 psychologists do not understand the connection between infantile amnesia and autobiographical memory
 although psychologists have evidence that infants have memory abilities  most people cannot remember life events that happened before the age of three years

3  According to paragraph 1  what is the evidence that a child has developed autobiographical memory
 The child is able to remember past events from before the age of three years
 The child is able to describe past events in a sufficiently lengthy and cohesive manner
 The child is aware that he or she does not remember experiences from before the age of three years
 The child is able to give a basic description of the nature of autobiographical memory



4  In paragraph 2  why does the author provide the information that children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering a past event
 To provide evidence that memories do not depend only upon verbal skills
 To challenge the idea that one year olds are too young to form memories
 To argue that the memory of one year olds depends only on action based codes
 To suggest that Piaget later revised his findings on the correlation between memory and verbal ability

7  According to paragraph 3  what is the relationship between autobiographical memory and the development of an understanding of the self
 Autobiographical memory aids in the development of an understanding of the self
 Children possess an understanding of the self when they can talk about past events in their lives
 The realization that the self continues through time may aid in the onset of autobiographical memory
 The development of autobiographical memory helps children gain an understanding of their roles in their social relationships

8  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as ways in which parents help their children understand the structure of narratives EXCEPT
 talking with their children about past events
 telling stories to their children
 having their children repeat stories back to them
 showing their children that they think memories are important
9  According to paragraph 4  the studies of Caucasian American and Korean children suggest which of the following
 Autobiographical memories develop similarly across all cultures
 Parents from different cultures tell their children different kinds of stories about the past
 Children s pleasure in hearing stories varies from culture to culture
 The kinds of interactions children have with their parents affect the development of autobiographical memories


10  According to paragraph 5  what evidence is there that a  theory of mind  is a factor in the development of autobiographical memory
 Even children who are not aware of their mental states are still able to talk about past events
 Autobiographical memory decreases when a child s feelings and mental state are upset
 Older children who are unable to achieve awareness of mental states lack autobiographical memory
 Children s memory of past events grows once children can answer questions about what it means to know and remember

11  The organization of the passage can best be described as
 the presentation of an argument followed by the evidence for and against it
 a description of a phenomenon followed by several possible theories about how it develops
 the definition of a psychological term followed by a history of its usage
 an explanation of a process followed by a discussion of its practical applications


12  The passage supports which of the following statements about the development of autobiographical memory
 It is unlikely that a single factor is responsible for the development of autobiographical memory
 Jean Piaget was the first psychologist to understand the development of autobiographical memory
 Understanding the development of autobiographical memory will help psychologists eliminate infant amnesia
 Understanding what it means to remember is the most important factor in the development of autobiographical memory

The ability to construct autobiographical memories coherent narratives about events from one s past is probably the joint product of several social and intellectual developments








Answer Choices

 Although children are capable of simple recognition and recall very early in life  they do not develop the capacity for autobiographical memory until the age of three or four years
 Verbal skills and familiarity with narrative structures probably aid in the construction of autobiographical memories
 Children s earliest autobiographical memories are usually about social interactions with parents
 Research suggests that infantile amnesia occurs in some cultures but not in others and may be linked to children s social experiences
 The development of autobiographical memory allows children to appreciate the fact that memories are an important part of their cultural experience
 Children who have acquired a concept of the self and of various mental states are generally able to talk about their own past memories
