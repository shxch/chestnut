The Origins of Theater
In seeking to describe the origins of theater  one must rely primarily on speculation  since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw  The most widely accepted theory  championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual  The process perceived by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly  During the early stages of its development  a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well being  Having little understanding of natural causes  it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces  and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces  Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires  the group repeats  refines and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies  or rituals
Stories  myths  may then grow up around a ritual  Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence  Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations  As a person becomes more sophisticated  its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change  As a result  it may abandon or modify some rites  But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group s oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites  When this occurs  the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity  and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns
Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular  it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being  Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative  Under this theory  relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures  Thus  the recalling of an event  a hunt  battle  or other feat  is elaborated through the narrator s pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person
A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic  rhythmical or gymnastic  or from imitations of animal noises and sounds  Admiration for the performer s skill  virtuosity  and grace are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances
In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater  scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater  Why did theater develop  and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual  Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs  One  set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B C   sees humans as naturally imitative as taking pleasure in imitating persons  things  and actions and in seeing such imitations  Another  advanced in the twentieth century  suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy  through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life  Thus  fantasy or fiction  of which drama is one form  permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears  confront them  and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact  The theater  then  is one tool whereby people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities
But neither the human imitative instinct nor a penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater  Therefore  additional explanations are needed  One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems  For example  one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision  since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group  Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense  For example  some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well being and abandoned them  nevertheless  they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness
