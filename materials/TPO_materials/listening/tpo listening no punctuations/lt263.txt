Lecture2 Biology Carbon Cycling
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class
Professor
OK．Just before the end of the last class  we started talking about trace metals  metals found in living organisms in very small quantities that serve an important biological  important nutritive function in those organisms．And one trace metal that serves a nutritive function is zinc．

Zinc assists in a number of processes in humans  but we are going to focus on just one  one that applies to a number of organisms  not just humans．See  zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling  the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon  Iike carbon dioxide  into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use．So  take respiration．Our bodies  our cells produce carbon dioxide when they
break down sugars．We need to get the CO2 out of our bodies  so the CO2 is converted into carbonic acid  which the blood is able to carry to the lungs．Once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs  it s converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out．

Now  this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme．Uh  who remembers what an enzyme is  Bob
Student
Uh  it s a protein  a specific kind of protein  one that speeds up chemical reactions
Professor
Exactly．Different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions．Now  the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it．So this zinc enzyme is critical for getting CO2 out of our bodies through the lungs．And it s also extremely important for plants．Bob  can you tell us why
Student
For making food  for photosynthesis
Professor
Exactly．For photosynthesis．Plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans．So zinc is also important for plants．

OK．But zinc is scarce in certain environments．And it s particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans  which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all．In fact  there are a lot of marine plants that survive  that grow and reproduce in surface waters．In particular  there are a lot of diatoms．
Diatoms are microscopic  photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean．There are a number of different types of diatoms  and  well  diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process  because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean．The carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten  say  by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean  or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor

So how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce  Well  recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a different enzyme that serves the same purpose．But this enzyme doesn t contain zinc．Instead this new enzyme incorporates another trace metal  cadmium．Kelly  you ve got a question

Student
Yeah．I thought cadmium was toxic．Didn t you say that
Professor
It is poisonous to humans．Uh  actually  we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life  that it didn t serve any biological purpose．But new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc  that organisms can use it instead of zinc when there isn t enough zinc in their environment．

Now  the discovery of this cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons．It s actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium．So it s possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes  that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce．And there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmium
to cycle carbon．

But there s something else to think about．What is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere  one of the major culprits in global warming．Carbon dioxide  right

Now  if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface  converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean  well  maybe there s more to that whole process  that cycle  something that we ve overlooked．So further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too．
