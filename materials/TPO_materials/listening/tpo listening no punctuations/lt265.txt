0K．We have been looking at some of the smaller members of our solar system  comets．You already know about the structure of comets．Let s continue our discussion now by talking about orbits  especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets．These are the comets that circle around the Sun pretty regularly．They return again and again  predictably  after a certain period of time．That s why we say their orbits are periodic．Probably the most famous and brightest of these is Halley s comet．

Halley s comet comes from far out in the solar system  goes in close to the Sun  and then out again．At its closest approach to the Sun  Halley s comet is about twice as close to the Sun as Earth is．And at its farthest．It s about thirty five times farther from the Sun than we are  which puts it out beyond Neptune  Basically  the idea here is that a periodic comet  with its very elongated orbit  just keeps coming back around again and again．With Halley s comet  well  it returns every 75 years  roughly．

But where is Halley s comet during most of this time  Well  like all orbiting bodies  a comet moves faster when it s closer to the Sun．So it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood  inside the orbit of Jupiter．Most of its time is spent way out beyond Jupiter s orbit  poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit．Because of this  we can only see Halley s for a few months every 75 years  first on its way in toward the Sun  and then on its way out again．

Now  you remember from our previous discussion that a comet s nucleus  its core  is made up of ice and dust  like a frozen snowball．And as it approaches the Sun  it starts to heat up．And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus．The gases that vaporize from the comet  the comet never collects them back again  so on every orbit  the comet leaves part of itself behind．

OK．How old is this solar system  Four and a half billion years．remember  And Halley s is going around the Sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time．So the comet should be long gone by now  right  I mean  how come Halley s is still there  After four and a half billion years．How could it be  Well  the answer is that this comet hasn t always been in such a short periodic orbit  since once a comet gets into
an orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently．Well  that comet s probably not going to be around too much longer  So this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet s life．A phase that just precedes its final breakup．We ve seen comets do that  going toward the Sun and then come back around  torn into pieces．

But lots of comets aren t like that．They come in  pass behind the Sun  and then travel back out．But with an orbit so large  and its farthest place so far away from the Sun that we just don t know how far out it goes．We just can t determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see．So these are often called parabolic orbit comets．Parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end．Actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the Sun eventually  but the period might be tens of thousands of years．And basically  we can t determine it．So we just  we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets．

So  what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the Sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor  Well  gravitational interaction with planets  right  lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to Jupiter or Saturn or one of the other planets  then the pull of that planet s gravity might alter the orbit  maybe make it much shorter．So this comet  if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way  it can be drawn into a new orbit  one that ll capture it and keep it coming back around the Sun much more often．
