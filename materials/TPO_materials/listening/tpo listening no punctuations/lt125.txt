Professor
The word opera means work  actually it means works  It s the plural of the word opus from the Latin  And in Italian it refers in general to works of art  Opera Lyrica or lyric opera refers to what we think of as opera  the musical drama

Opera was commonplace in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became commercial as a venture  And during those years  several things happened  primarily linguistic or thematic and both involving secularization

Musical drama started in the churches  It was an educational tool  It was used primarily as a vehicle for teaching religion and was generally presented in Latin  the language of the Christian Church which had considerable influence in Italy at that time  But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages it was really only merchants  aristocrats and clergy who could deal with Latin  The vast majority of the population used their own regional vernacular in all aspects of their lives  And so in what is now Italy  operas quit being presented in Latin and started being presented in Italian

And once that happened  the themes of the opera presentations also started to change  And musical drama moved from the church to the plaza right outside the church  And the themes again  the themes changed  And opera was no longer about teaching religion as it was about satire and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or persecution  or what have you

Opera  as we think of it  is of course a resurrected form  It is the melodious drama of ancient Greek theater  the term  melodious drama  being shortened eventually to  melodrama  because operas frequently are melodramatic  not to say unrealistic  And the group that put the first operas together that we have today then  were  well…it was a group of men that included Galileo s father Vincenzo  and they met in Florence he and a group of friends of the count of Bardi and they formed what is called the Camerata dei Bardi  And they took classical theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance time  This…uh…this produced some of the operas that we have today

Now what happened in the following century is very simple  Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than Italians were  And so as Italians migrated across Europe  they carried theater with them and opera specifically because it was an Italian form

What happened is that the major divide in opera that endures today took place  The French said opera ought to reflect the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature  bearing in mind that we are talking about the golden age in French literature  And so the music was secondary  if you will  to the dramatic cadence of language  to the way the rhythm of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of course as a result instead of arias or solos  which would come to dominate Italian opera  The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or recitative in English  The lyrics were spoken  frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord

The French said you really can t talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on mythology to give them their characters and their plots  mythology  the pastoral traditions  the novels of chivalry or the epics of chivalry out of the middle Ages  The Italians said  no this is a great historical tool and what better way to educate the public about Nero or Attila or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to

The English appropriated opera after the French  Opera came late to England because all theaters  public theaters were closed  of course  during their civil war  And it wasn t until the restoration in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off  The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy

So that you have this circle of musical influences  the Italians invented opera  the French adapted it  the English adopted it  the Italians took it back

It came to America late and was considered to elitist for the general public  But Broadway musicals fulfilled a similar function for a great long while

John Jay Chapman wrote about opera  quote   If an extraterrestrial being were to appear before us and say  what is your society like  what is this Earth thing all about  you could do worse than take that creature to an opera   End quote  Because opera does  after all  begin with a man and a woman and an emotion
