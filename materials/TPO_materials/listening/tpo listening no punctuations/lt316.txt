Lecture4 Anthropology  the Botai People & Horses
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class

Professor
So now that we ve discussed how people in ancient societies tamed animals like cows and chickens for food and other uses  I d like to talk about an ancient culture that domesticated horses  It s the Botai people
The Botai culture thrived over 5 000 years ago in central Asia  in what is now northern Kazakhstan  Pretty much all of what we know about the Botai comes from three archaeological sites  And we learned that the Botai were able to build large perennial villages  sometimes with hundreds of homes  We also found horse bones at these sites and these can be traced back to the time of the Botai settlements  The climate that the Botai culture lived in…it was harsh  And the Botai people…they didn t really seem to have much in the way of agriculture going on  So their whole economy was really based on horses  And because horses can withstand the tough climate  they can survive ice storms and they don t need heated barns  the Botai people could settle in one place and rely on the horses for food  clothing and transportation
Student
So the Botai were the first to domesticate horses
Professor
Well  we are pretty sure that horses were first domesticated a bit earlier  to the northwest  in the area that is now Ukraine and western Russia  It s quite possible that some of those people later migrated east to Kazakhstan
Student
But what exactly tells us that these Botai people  that the horses in their area were really domesticated
Professor
As with most ancient history  there is not much that we can be certain about  But we know there was a significant population of wild horses in that area  So there were plenty of opportunities for the Botai people to find horses to domesticate  We also know that horse milk was an important source of food for the Botai people  What  Milking a wild horse  Well  now  that would be impossible…to milk a wild horse  And then… there s the…
Oh  Yes  Eric
Student
So you said last week that for some animals  like for dogs  there were physical changes taking place over the course of generations of dogs because of domestication  So can we tell from those horse bones if it was sort of the same for horses
Professor
Actually  it wasn t  We know that horses have not changed a lot physically as a result of domestication  So those ancient horse bones don t tell us much about domestication  But…we ve found that…um…we ve found what maybe pens or corrals in the Botai settlements  And not too long ago  a new approach was used to find out if the Botai people were keeping horses  Soil samples from these pens or corrals show ten times the concentration of phosphorus
Student
Um…phosphorus
Professor
Yes  Phosphorus is a very significant indicator that horses  large numbers of horses were being kept in the settlements  You see  horse manure  horse waste is rich in phosphorus and also nitrogen compared to normal soil  But nitrogen is an unstable element  It can be washed out when it rains or it can be released to the atmosphere  whereas phosphorus combines with calcium and iron  and can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years
The soil from the Botai settlement sites was found to have high concentrations of phosphorus and low nitrogen concentrations  which is important since it suggests that what we ve got is really old  not something added to the soil more recently
Student
Wait  So if horses have been there recently  there d still be lots of nitrogen in the soil
Professor
That s right  Yes  Karen
Student
I just read an article  It said that one way to determine if there was an ancient fireplace at an archaeological site was to check the soil for phosphorus  So couldn t the phosphorus at the Botai sites just be from the frequent use of fireplaces
Professor
You are absolutely right  However  when a fireplace leaves behind a lot of phosphorus in the soil  we d also find an unusually high concentration of potassium  But the soil at the Botai settlements  it was found with relatively little potassium  which makes it far more likely that the phosphorus came from horses  OK
Now  later on  people of the same region  northern Kazakhstan  started raising sheep and cattle  And that led to a more nomadic culture  Since sheep and cattle can t survive harsh climates  they needed to be taken south every winter  Moving around meant working harder but the trade off was far richer  fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep
