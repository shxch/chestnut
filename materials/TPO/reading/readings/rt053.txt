The Cambrian Explosion
The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and biological events  including the origin of Earth about 4 6 billion years ago  the origin of life about 3 5 billion years ago  the origin of eukaryotic life forms  living things that have cells with true nuclei  about 1 5 billion years ago  and the origin of animals about 0 6 billion years ago  The last event marks the beginning of the Cambrian period  Animals originated relatively late in the history of Earth in only the last 10 percent of Earth s history  During a geologically brief 100 million year period  all modern animal groups  along with other animals that are now extinct  evolved  This rapid origin and diversification of animals is often referred to as  the Cambrian explosion
Scientists have asked important questions about this explosion for more than a century  Why did it occur so late in the history of Earth  The origin of multicellular forms of life seems a relatively simple step compared to the origin of life itself  Why does the fossil record not document the series of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals  Why did animal life evolve so quickly  Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these questions
One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils during this important 100 million year period is that early animals were soft bodied and simply did not fossilize  Fossilization of soft bodied animals is less likely than fossilization of hard bodied animals  but it does occur  Conditions that promote fossilization of soft bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages decomposition  In fact  fossil beds containing soft bodied animals have been known for many years
The Ediacara fossil formation  which contains the oldest known animal fossils  consists exclusively of soft bodied forms  Although named after a site in Australia  the Ediacara formation is worldwide in distribution and dates to Precambrian times  This 700 million year old formation gives few clues to the origins of modern animals  however  because paleontologists believe it represents an evolutionary experiment that failed  It contains no ancestors of modern animal groups
A slightly younger fossil formation containing animal remains is the Tommotian formation  named after a locale in Russia  It dates to the very early Cambrian period  and it also contains only soft bodied forms  At one time  the animals present in these fossil beds were assigned to various modern animal groups  but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils represent unique body forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and disappeared before the end of the period  leaving no descendants in modern animal groups
A third fossil formation containing both soft bodied and hard bodied animals provides evidence of the result of the Cambrian explosion  This fossil formation  called the Burgess Shale  is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia  Shortly after the Cambrian explosion  mud slides rapidly buried thousands of marine animals under conditions that favored fossilization  These fossil beds provide evidence of about 32 modern animal groups  plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one of the modern groups  These unassignable animals include a large swimming predator called Anomalocaris and a soft bodied animal called Wiwaxia  which ate detritus or algae  The Burgess Shale formation also has fossils of many extinct representatives of modern animal groups  For example  a well known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a representative of a previously unknown group of arthropods  a category of animals that includes insects  spiders  mites  and crabs
Fossil formations like the Burgess Shale show that evolution cannot always be thought of as a slow progression  The Cambrian explosion involved rapid evolutionary diversification  followed by the extinction of many unique animals  Why was this evolution so rapid  No one really knows  Many zoologists believe that it was because so many ecological niches were available with virtually no competition from existing species  Will zoologists ever know the evolutionary sequences in the Cambrian explosion  Perhaps another ancient fossil bed of soft bodied animals from 600 million year old seas is awaiting discovery

1  The word  significant  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 numerous
 important
 unexplained
 sudden
2  The word  relatively  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 surprisingly
 collectively
 comparatively
 characteristically
3  The word  diversification  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 emergence of many varieties
 steady decline in number
 gradual increase in body size
 sudden disappearance
4  The period discussed in the passage is referred to as an  explosion  because it
 occurred 0 6 billion years ago  late in Earth s history
 was characterized by the unusually fast evolution of many new life forms
 was characterized by widespread animal extinction
 was characterized by violent volcanic eruptions

5  According to Paragraph2  which of the following is NOT a question that paleontologists asked about the Cambrian explosion
 Why was the origin of life a simple step in Earth s history
 Why did it take so long for multicellular organisms to develop
 Why did animal life evolve so rapidly
 Why does the fossil record lack evidence of animal evolution during that time

6  Which of the following best describes the relationship between paragraph 2 and paragraph 3
 Paragraph 2 puts forward several scientific claims  one of which is rejected in paragraph 3
 Paragraph 2 poses several questions  and paragraph 3 offers a possible answer to one of them
 Paragraph 2 presents outdated traditional views  while paragraph 3 presents the current scientific conclusions
 Paragraph 2 introduces a generalization that is illustrated by specific examples in paragraph 3

7  The word  promote  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 complicate
 prevent
 encourage
 	affect



8  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 4 as being true of the Ediacara formation
 It contains fossils that date back to the Precambrian period
 It contains only soft bodied animal fossils
 It is located on a single site in Australia
 It does not contain any fossils of the ancestors of modern animals



9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The animals found in the Tommotian fossil bed were once thought to belong to a variety of modern animal groups  but now they are thought to have descended from a single group
 Animals in the Tommotian fossil beds were initially assigned to modern animal groups but are now thought to belong to groups that emerged and died out during the Cambrian period
 Though at first they thought otherwise  paleontologists now agree that the animals in the Tommotian have body forms from which modern animals have descended
 It is unclear whether the Tommotian fossils from the early Cambrian period represent unique body forms or whether they should be assigned to various modern animal groups





10  Why does the author mention  Anomalocans  and  Wiwaxia
 To contrast predators with animals that eat plants such as algae
 To question the effects of rapid mud slides on fossilization
 To suggest that much is still unknown about animals found in the Burgess Shale
 To provide examples of fossils that cannot be assigned to a modern animal group

11   Sidneyia  is an example of
 a relative of Anomalocaris and Wiwaxia
 a previously unknown Burgess Shale animal
 an extinct member of a currently existing category of animals
 an animal that cannot be assigned to any modern animal group


12  What can be inferred from paragraph 7 about why the Cambrian explosion is so unusual
 It generated new ecological niches through the extinction of many unique animals
 It was a period of rapid evolution  and evolution is often thought of as a slow process
 It is a period whose evolutionary sequences are clearly marked
 It generated a very large number of ancient fossil beds containing soft bodied animals


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage  It is relatively rare because the fossilization of soft bodied animals requires a special environment
Where could the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

The term  Cambrian explosion  refers to the geologically brief period during which all modern animal groups evolved




Answer Choices

 Little is known about the stages of evolution during the Cambrian period  in part because early animals were soft bodied and could fossilize only under particular conditions
 While animal fossils from before the Cambrian explosion have no modern descendants  many animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion can be assigned to modern groups
 The Cambrian period is significant because it marks the emergence of eukaryotic life forms organisms that have cells with true nuclei
 The Ediacara fossil formation provides the most information about the Cambrian explosion  while the earlier  Tommotian and Burgess Shale formations give clues about Precambrian evolution
 Zoologists are awaiting the discovery of a 600 million year old fossil formation in order to be able to form a theory of how animal evolution progressed
 Although the reasons for the rapid evolution of animals during the Cambrian period are not known  one proposed explanation is an abundance of niches with a lack of competitors
