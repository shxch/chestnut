Water in the Desert
Rainfall is not completely absent in desert areas  but it is highly variable  An annual rainfall of four inches is often used to define the limits of a desert  The impact of rainfall upon the surface water and groundwater resources of the desert is greatly influenced by landforms  Flats and depressions where water can collect are common features  but they make up only a small part of the landscape
Arid lands  surprisingly  contain some of the world s largest river systems  such as the Murray Darling in Australia  the Rio Grande in North America  the Indus in Asia  and the Nile in Africa  These rivers and river systems are known as  exogenous  because their sources lie outside the arid zone  They are vital for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world  For centuries  the annual floods of the Nile  Tigris  and Euphrates  for example  have brought fertile silts and water to the inhabitants of their lower valleys  Today  river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention  creating a need for international river basin agreements  The filling of the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey has drastically reduced flows in the Euphrates  with potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq
The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the season  The desert sections of long rivers respond several months after rain has fallen outside the desert  so that peak flows may be in the dry season  This is useful for irrigation  but the high temperatures  low humidities  and different day lengths of the dry season  compared to the normal growing season  can present difficulties with some crops
Regularly flowing rivers and streams that originate within arid lands are known as  endogenous   These are generally fed by groundwater springs  and many issue from limestone massifs  such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco  Basaltic rocks also support springs  notably at the Jabal Al Arab on the Jordan Syria border  Endogenous rivers often do not reach the sea but drain into inland basins  where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground  Most desert streambeds are normally dry  but they occasionally receive large flows of water and sediment
Deserts contain large amounts of groundwater when compared to the amounts they hold in surface stores such as lakes and rivers  But only a small fraction of groundwater enters the hydrological cycle feeding the flows of streams  maintaining lake levels  and being recharged  or refilled  through surface flows and rainwater  In recent years  groundwater has become an increasingly important source of freshwater for desert dwellers  The United Nations Environment Programme and the World Bank have funded attempts to survey the groundwater resources of arid lands and to develop appropriate extraction techniques  Such programs are much needed because in many arid lands there is only a vague idea of the extent of groundwater resources  It is known  however  that the distribution of groundwater is uneven  and that much of it lies at great depths
Groundwater is stored in the pore spaces and joints of rocks and unconsolidated  unsolidified  sediments or in the openings widened through fractures and weathering  The water saturated rock or sediment is known as an  aquifer   Because they are porous  sedimentary rocks  such as sandstones and conglomerates  are important potential sources of groundwater  Large quantities of water may also be stored in limestones when joints and cracks have been enlarged to form cavities  Most limestone and sandstone aquifers are deep and extensive but may contain groundwaters that are not being recharged  Most shallow aquifers in sand and gravel deposits produce lower yields  but they can be rapidly recharged  Some deep aquifers are known as  fossil waters  The term  fossil  describes water that has been present for several thousand years  These aquifers became saturated more than 10 000 years ago and are no longer being recharged
Water does not remain immobile in an aquifer but can seep out at springs or leak into other aquifers  The rate of movement may be very slow  in the Indus plain  the movement of saline  salty  groundwaters has still not reached equilibrium after 70 years of being tapped  The mineral content of groundwater normally increases with the depth  but even quite shallow aquifers can be highly saline








1  Which of the following statements about annual rainfall can be inferred from paragraph 1
 Flat desert areas receive more annual rainfall than desert areas with mountains
 Areas that receive more than four inches of rain per year are not considered deserts
 Many areas receive less than four inches of annual rainfall  but only a few are deserts
 Annual rainfall has no impact on the groundwater resources of desert areas




2  The word  drastically  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 obviously
 unfortunately
 rapidly
 severely


3  In paragraph 2  why does the author mention the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey
 To contrast the Euphrates River with other exogenous rivers
 To illustrate the technological advances in dam building
 To argue that dams should not be built on the Euphrates River
 To support the idea that international river basin agreements are needed


4  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is true of the Nile River
 The Nile s flow in its desert sections is at its lowest during the dry season
 The Nile s sources are located in one of the most arid zones of the world
 The Nile s annual floods bring fertile silts and water to its lower valley
 The Nile s periodic flooding hinders the growth of some crops

5  The word  dwellers  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 settlements
 farmers
 tribes
 inhabitants
6  Paragraph 5 supports all of the following statements about the groundwater in deserts EXCEPT
 The groundwater is consistently found just below the surface
 A small part of the groundwater helps maintain lake levels
 Most of the groundwater is not recharged through surface water
 The groundwater is increasingly used as a source of freshwater
7  The word  fractures  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 streams
 cracks
 storms
 earthquakes
8  According to paragraph 6  which of the following statements about aquifers in deserts is true
 Water from limestone and sandstone aquifers is generally better to drink than water from sand and gravel aquifers
 Sand and gravel aquifers tend to contain less groundwater than limestone or sandstone aquifers
 Groundwater in deep aquifers is more likely to be recharged than groundwater in shallow aquifers
 Sedimentary rocks  because they are porous  are not capable of storing large amounts of groundwater
  9  According to paragraph 6  the aquifers called fossil waters
 contain fossils that are thousands of years old
 took more than 10 000 years to become saturated with water
 have not gained or lost any water for thousands of years
 have been collecting water for the past 10 000 years








10  The word  immobile  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 enclosed
 permanent
 motionless
 intact


11  The passage supports which of the following statements about water in the desert
 The most visible forms of water are not the most widespread forms of water in the desert
 Groundwater in the desert cannot become a source of drinking water but can be used for irrigation
 Most of the water in the desert is contained in shallow aquifers that are being rapidly recharged
 Desert areas that lack endogenous or exogenous rivers and streams cannot support life




12  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
These sudden floods provide important water supplies but can also be highly destructive
Where would the sentence best fit
