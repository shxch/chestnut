Conversation 1  Faculty Advisor
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and a faculty advisor for the university newspaper
Student  Hi  I am sorry to bother you  but…
Faculty advisor  Yes
Student  This is about the newspaper
Faculty Advisor  Oh  Ok  Well  I am only the advisor  the newspaper office is off campus on Pine Street  Eh…what was it  Did you want to work for the paper  We are always looking for writers
Student  Well  my problem was with the writing actually  with an article that was published in yesterday s newspaper
Faculty Advisor  Oh  Which one
Student  The one about the student government and its president Sally Smith
Faculty Advisor  Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the statue  Eh  the statue at the main entrance of the university
Student  Well  that s part of it  But you know  the editor used the situation to say some really unfair things  about the student government  and the president Sally Smith in particular  I think the paper should publish a retraction  or at the very least an apology to Sally
Faculty Advisor  Ok  Um… if I remember correctly  what you are referring to wasn t a news story  but an editorial  right  Eh  it was on the opinion page  it was signed by one of the editors  and was clearly labeled as commentary
Student  Well  yes  But the thing about the statue  Sally made this simple comment that was in really bad condition and should be replaced  And  well  the tone in the editorial was demeaning  It accused her of not respecting the past and it had some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary
Faculty Advisor  Wait a minute  Remind me
Student  Well  you know  it implied that Sally doesn t know much about the university s history and it called her a big city politician because she s from Boston  It s just mean spirited  isn t it
Faculty Advisor  Haven t you heard the saying  all publicity is good publicity
Student  Well…
Faculty Advisor  I d say the article is bringing attention to the student government organization  which is pretty invisible  Eh  you rarely hear about what the student government is doing
Student  But this article…
Faculty Advisor  And the piece  well  yeah  it had a bit of an exaggerated tone  It was satirical  or at least it was meant to be  It wasn t just poking fun at Sally  but the whole idea that our school is sort of rural  and you know  not cosmopolitan
Student  Well  none of us thought it was very funny
Faculty Advisor  Well  sometimes it s best just to roll with it  It is just a cliché  everybody knows it is not true
Student  But I thought we could expect better than that here
Faculty Advisor  Well  I am certainly in favor of getting a variety of viewpoints   so why don t you go talk to the editor  Jennifer Hamilton  and tell her you want equal time  You or Sally could write a response
Student   Really  She would let us do that    Didn t she write it
Faculty Advisor  I ll let Jennifer know you are coming  she feels the same way I do  She is journalism major  She would be happy to publish another point of view
