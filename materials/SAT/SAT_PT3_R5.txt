This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.
Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder, the
percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four
pathogens and by all four pathogens together.

How do the words “can,” “may,” and “could” in the
third paragraph (lines 19-41) help establish the tone
of the paragraph?
A) They create an optimistic tone that makes clear
the authors are hopeful about the effects of their
research on colony collapse disorder.
B) They create a dubious tone that makes clear the
authors do not have confidence in the usefulness
of the research described.
C) They create a tentative tone that makes clear the
authors suspect but do not know that their
hypothesis is correct.
D) They create a critical tone that makes clear the
authors are skeptical of claims that pyrethrums
are inherent in mono-crops.
43
In line 42, the authors state that a certain hypothesis
“can best be tested by a trial.” Based on the passage,
which of the following is a hypothesis the authors
suggest be tested in a trial?
A) Honeybees that are exposed to both pyrethrums
and mites are likely to develop a secondary
infection by a virus, a bacterium, or a fungus.
B) Beekeepers who feed their honeybee colonies a
diet of a single crop need to increase the use of
insecticides to prevent mite infestations.
C) A honeybee diet that includes pyrethrums results
in honeybee colonies that are more resistant to
mite infestations.
D) Humans are more susceptible to varroa mites as
a result of consuming nutritionally deficient
food crops.
44
Which choice provides the best evidence for the
answer to the previous question?
A) Lines 3-5 (“These mites... viruses”)
B) Lines 16-18 (“In fact... cream”)
C) Lines 19-21 (“We suspect... deficient”)
D) Lines 24-28 (“Without... bees”)
45
The passage most strongly suggests that beekeepers’
attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially
produced insecticides have what unintentional
effect?
A) They increase certain mite populations.
B) They kill some beneficial forms of bacteria.
C) They destroy bees’ primary food source.
D) They further harm the health of some bees.
46
Which choice provides the best evidence for the
answer to the previous question?
A) Lines 1-2 (“Honey bees... mites”)
B) Lines 6-7 (“Little... control”)
C) Lines 31-35 (“In addition... infestation”)
D) Lines 47-50 (“Mites... control colonies”)
47
As used in line 35, “postulate” most nearly means to
A) make an unfounded assumption.
B) put forth an idea or claim.
C) question a belief or theory.
D) conclude based on firm evidence.
48
The main purpose of the fourth paragraph
(lines 42-50) is to
A) summarize the results of an experiment that
confirmed the authors’ hypothesis about the role
of clover in the diets of wild-type honeybees.
B) propose an experiment to investigate how
different diets affect commercial honeybee
colonies’ susceptibility to mite infestations.
C) provide a comparative nutritional analysis of the
honey produced by the experimental colonies
and by the control colonies.
D) predict the most likely outcome of an unfinished
experiment summarized in the third paragraph
(lines 19-41).

An unstated assumption made by the authors about
clover is that the plants
A) do not produce pyrethrums.
B) are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
C) are usually located near wild-type honeybee
colonies.
D) will not be a good food source for honeybees in
the control colonies.
50
Based on data in the table, in what percent of
colonies with colony collapse disorder were the
honeybees infected by all four pathogens?
A) 0 percent
B) 77 percent
C) 83 percent
D) 100 percent
51
Based on data in the table, which of the four
pathogens infected the highest percentage of
honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder?
A) IAPV
B) KBV
C) Nosema apis
D) Nosema ceranae
52
Do the data in the table provide support for the
authors’ claim that infection with varroa mites
increases a honeybee’s susceptibility to secondary
infections?
A) Yes, because the data provide evidence that
infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to
undergo colony collapse disorder.
B) Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of
colonies infected is greater for colonies with
colony collapse disorder than for colonies
without colony collapse disorder.
C) No, because the data do not provide evidence
about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse
disorder.
D) No, because the data do not indicate whether the
honeybees had been infected with mites.
