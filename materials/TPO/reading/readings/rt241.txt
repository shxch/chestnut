Lake Water
Where does the water in a lake come from  and how does water leave it  Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers  from underwater seeps and springs  from overland flow off the surrounding land  and from rain falling directly on the lake surface  Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers  by soaking into the bed of the lake  and by evaporation  So much is obvious
The questions become more complicated when actual volumes of water are considered  how much water enters and leaves by each route  Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing stream and river  Then exchanges with the atmosphere are calculated by finding the difference between the gains from rain  as measured  rather roughly  by rain gauges  and the losses by evaporation  measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss  For the majority of lakes  certainly those surrounded by forests  input from overland flow is too small to have a noticeable effect  Changes in lake level not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the atmosphere must be due to the net difference between what seeps into the lake from the groundwater and what leaks into the groundwater  Note the word  net   measuring the actual amounts of groundwater seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more complicated matter than merely inferring their difference
Once all this information has been gathered  it becomes possible to judge whether a lake s flow is mainly due to its surface inputs and outputs or to its underground inputs and outputs  If the former are greater  the lake is a surface water dominated lake  if the latter  it is a seepage dominated lake  Occasionally  common sense tells you which of these two possibilities applies  For example  a pond in hilly country that maintains a steady water level all through a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must obviously be seepage dominated  Conversely  a pond with a stream flowing in one end and out the other  which dries up when the stream dries up  is clearly surface water dominated
By whatever means  a lake is constantly gaining water and losing water  its water does not just sit there  or  anyway  not for long  This raises the matter of a lake s residence time  The residence time is the average length of time that any particular molecule of water remains in the lake  and it is calculated by dividing the volume of water in the lake by the rate at which water leaves the lake  The residence time is an average  the time spent in the lake by a given molecule  if we could follow its fate  would depend on the route it took  it might flow through as part of the fastest  most direct current  or it might circle in a backwater for an indefinitely long time
Residence times vary enormously  They range from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones  Lake Tahoe  in California  has a residence time of 700 years  The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America  namely  Lakes Superior  Michigan  Huron  Erie  and Ontario  are  respectively  190 100 22 2 5  and 6 years  Lake Erie s is the lowest  although its area is larger than Lake Ontario s  its volume is less than one third as great because it is so shallow less than 20 meters on average
A given lake s residence time is by no means a fixed quantity  It depends on the rate at which water enters the lake  and that depends on the rainfall and the evaporation rate  Climatic change  the result of global warming   is dramatically affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario  Canada  In the period 1970 to 1986  rainfall in the area decreased from 1 000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum  while above average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration rate  the rate at which water is lost to the atmosphere through evaporation and the processes of plant life
The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period  The slowing down of water renewal leads to a chain of further consequences  it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated  and this  in turn  has a marked effect on all living things in the lake





1  The phrase So much in the passage refers to
 the negative effects of overland flow  rain  and evaporation on river water levels
 water that a lake loses to outflowing rivers  to the lake bed  and to evaporation
 the importance of rivers to the maintenance of lake water levels
 the information given about ways that water can enter or exit a lake


2  The word gains in the passage is closest in meaning to
 results
 increases
 resources
 savings

3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the movement of water into a lake
 Heavy rain accounts for most of the water that enters into lakes
 Rainfall replaces approximately the amount of water lost through evaporation
 Overland flow into lakes is reduced by the presence of forests
 Seepage has a smaller effect on water level than any other input

4  Why does the author use the phrase Note the word  net  in the passage
 To emphasize the impact of seepage on water levels
 To point out that seepage is calculated differently from river flows and atmospheric exchanges
 To compare the different methods of calculating seepage
 To emphasize the difficulty of obtaining specific values for seepage inputs and outputs






5  The word conversely meaning to
 on the other hand
 in the same way
 in other words
 on average

6  According to paragraph 3  which of the following best describes a seepage dominated lake
 A lake that is fed by streams but still has fluctuating water levels
 A lake with a constant water level that has no streams or rivers as inputs
 A lake with a stream flowing into it and a stream flowing out of it
 A lake that has surface and underground inputs but loses water during dry seasons


  7  It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that the length of time a given molecule of water remains in a lake
 depends entirely upon the average speed of a lake  s currents
 can be measured by the volume of the lake alone
 can be greater or lesser than the residence time
 is similar to the length of time all other molecules remain in that lake






8  According to paragraph 5  Lake Erie s residence time is lower than Lake Ontario s for which of the following reasons
 Lake Erie has a larger area than Lake Ontario
 Lake Ontario is shallower than Lake Erie
 Lake Ontario has a greater volume than Lake Erie
 Lake Erie receives less rainfall than Lake Ontario

9  Why does the author discuss the Great Lakes in paragraph 5
 To demonstrate the extent to which residence times vary from lake to lake
 To illustrate how residence times are calculated for specific lakes
 To argue that the residence time of a lake increases with area
 To emphasize that Lake Tahoe  s residence time is unusually long










10  The word further in the passage is closest in meaning to
 expected
 additional
 serious
 unfortunate

11  According to paragraph 6  which of the following explains the increase in residence time of some lakes of northwestern Ontario
 The amount of water flowing into the lakes has increased
 The rate of evaporation has decreased more sharply than the amount of rainfall
 The renewal of the lakes  water has slowed due to changes in climate
 Plants have required less water from the lakes

12  According to paragraph 6  residence time is affected by all of the following EXCEPT
 amount of rainfall
 rate of evaporation
 temperature of surrounding air
 concentration of chemicals in lake water

This question is worth 2 points
Water enters  remains  and eventually leaves a lake in a variety of ways










Answer Choices


 By measuring the water quantities at each of a lake s inputs and outputs  it can be determined whether water enters the lake mainly from surface or groundwater sources
 Changes in lake level and volume are caused principally by the amount of evaporation of water into the atmosphere
 It is sometimes possible to decide whether a lake is surface water dominated or seepage dominated by simple observation at different seasons
 The average period of time that molecules of water spend in a lake the residence time varies from lake to lake and overtime within a particular lake
 The residence times of surface water dominated lakes are usually longer than those of seepage dominated lakes
 The residence time of a lake frequently depends on the kinds of organisms to be found in the lake
