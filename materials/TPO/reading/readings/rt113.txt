Begging by Nestlings
Many signals that animals make seem to impose on the signalers costs that are overly damaging  A classic example is noisy begging by nestling songbirds when a parent returns to the nest with food  These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the nest away to a listening hawk or raccoon  resulting in the death of the defenseless nestlings  In fact  when tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest containing an egg  the egg in that  noisy  nest was taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a nearby quiet nest in 29 of 37 trials

Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees  The young of ground nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree nesting relatives  These higher frequency sounds do not travel as far  and so may better conceal the individuals producing them  who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground nests  David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree nesting or of ground nesting warblers  The eggs  advertised  by the tree nesters  begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground nesters  calls

The hypothesis that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their potential for attracting predators yields a prediction  baby birds of species that experience high rates of nest predation should produce softer begging signals of higher frequency than nestlings of other species less often victimized by nest predators  This prediction was supported by data collected in one survey of 24 species from an Arizona forest  more evidence that predator pressure favors the evolution of begging calls that are hard to detect and pinpoint

Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food  what benefit do begging nestlings derive from their communications  One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate signals of its real hunger and good health  making it worthwhile for the listening parent to give it food in a nest where several other offspring are usually available to be fed  If this hypothesis is true  then it follows that nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals produced by their nestmates  who are competing for parental attention  When experimentally deprived baby robins are placed in a nest with normally fed siblings  the hungry nestlings beg more loudly than usual but so do their better fed siblings  though not as loudly as the hungrier birds

If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy offspring capable of vigorous begging  then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offsprings  calls  Indeed  if you take baby tree swallows out of a nest for an hour feeding half the set and starving the other half  when the birds are replaced in the nest  the starved youngsters beg more loudly than the fed birds  and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less vigorously

As these experiments show  begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding  But the question arises  why don t nestlings beg loudly when they aren t all that hungry  By doing so  they could possibly secure more food  which should result in more rapid growth or larger size  either of which is advantageous  The answer lies apparently not in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories but rather in the damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings  which share genes with one another  An individual s success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own personal reproductive success  Because close relatives have many of the same genes  animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes  Therefore  a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise

1  The phrase  impose on  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 increase for
 remove from
 place on
 distribute to
2  According to paragraph 1  the experiment with tapes of begging tree swallows establishes which of the following
 Begging by nestling birds can attract the attention of predators to the nest
 Nest predators attack nests that contain nestlings more frequently than they attack nests that contain only eggs
 Tapes of begging nestlings attract predators to the nest less frequently than real begging calls do
 Nest predators have no other means of locating bird nests except the begging calls of nestling birds


3  The word  artificial  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 attractive
 not real
 short term
 well designed
4  Paragraph 2 indicates that the begging calls of tree nesting warblers
 put them at more risk than ground nesting warblers experience
 can be heard from a greater distance than those of ground nesting warblers
 are more likely to conceal the signaler than those of ground nesting warblers
 have higher frequencies than those of ground nesting warblers

5  The experiment described in paragraph 2 supports which of the following conclusions
 Predators are unable to distinguish between the begging cheeps of ground nesting and those of tree nesting warblers except by the differing frequencies of the calls
 When they can find them  predators prefer the eggs of tree nesting warblers to those of ground nesting warblers
 The higher frequencies of the begging cheeps of ground nesting warblers are an adaptation to the threat that ground nesting birds face from predators
 The danger of begging depends more on the frequency of the begging cheep than on how loud it is





6  The word  prediction  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 surprise
 discovery
 explanation
 expectation


7  The word  pinpoint  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 observe
 locate exactly
 copy accurately
 recognize






8  The word  derive  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 require
 gain
 use
 produce






9  In paragraphs 4 and 5  what evidence supports the claim that the intensity of nestling begging calls is a good indicator of which offspring in a nest would most benefit from a feeding
 When placed in a nest with hungry robins  well fed robins did not beg for food
 Among robin nestlings  the intensity of begging decreased the more the nestlings were fed
 Hungry tree swallow nestlings begged louder than well fed nestlings in the same nest
 Hungry tree swallow nestlings continued to beg loudly until they were fed whereas well fed nestlings soon stopped begging



10  It can be inferred from paragraphs 4 and 5 that parent songbirds normally do not feed
 nestlings that are too weak to beg for food as vigorously as their nestmates
 more than one hungry nestling during a single visit to the nest
 offspring that were fed by the parents on the previous visit to the nest
 nestlings that have been removed and then later put back into their nest

















11  In paragraph 6  the author compares the energy costs of vigorous begging with the potential gain in calories from such begging in order to
 explain why begging for food vigorously can lead to faster growth and increased size
 explain how begging vigorously can increase an individual s chance of propagating its own genes
 point out a weakness in a possible explanation for why nestlings do not always beg vigorously
 argue that the benefits of vigorous begging outweigh any possible disadvantages


12  According to paragraph 6  which of the following explains the fact that a well fed nestling does not beg loudly for more food
 There is no benefit for a nestling to get more food than it needs to survive
 By begging loudly for food it does not need  a nestling would unnecessarily expose itself to danger from predators
 If a nestling begs loudly when it is not truly hungry  then when it is truly hungry its own begging may be drowned out by that of its well fed siblings
 More of a nestling s genes will be passed to the next generation if its hungry siblings get enough food to survive

Experiments have shed much light on the begging behaviors of baby songbirds





Answer Choices

 Songbird species that are especially vulnerable to predators have evolved ways of reducing the dangers associated with begging calls
 Songbird parents focus their feeding effort on the nestlings that beg loudest for food
 It is genetically disadvantageous for nestlings to behave as if they are really hungry when they are not really hungry
 The begging calls of songbird nestlings provide a good example of overly damaging cost to signalers of signaling
 The success with which songbird nestlings communicate their hunger to their parents is dependent on the frequencies of the nestlings  begging calls
 Songbird nestlings have evolved several different ways to communicate the intensity of their hunger to their parents
