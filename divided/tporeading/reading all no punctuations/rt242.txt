Breathing During Sleep
Of all the physiological differences in human sleep compared with wakefulness that have been discovered in the last decade  changes in respiratory control are most dramatic  Not only are there differences in the level of the functioning of respiratory systems  there are even changes in how they function  Movements of the rib cage for breathing are reduced during sleep  making the contractions of the diaphragm more important  Yet because of the physics of lying down  the stomach applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it more difficult for the diaphragm to do its job  However  there are many other changes that affect respiration when asleep
During wakefulness  breathing is controlled by two interacting systems  The first is an automatic  metabolic system whose control is centered in the brain stem  It subconsciously adjusts breathing rate and depth in order to regulate the levels of carbon dioxide  CO2  and oxygen  O2   and the acid base ratio in the blood  The second system is the voluntary  behavioral system  Its control center is based in the forebrain  and it regulates breathing for use in speech  singing  sighing  and so on  It is capable of ignoring or overriding the automatic  metabolic system and produces an irregular pattern of breathing
During NREM  the phase of sleep in which there is no rapid eye movement  breathing becomes deeper and more regular  but there is also a decrease in the breathing rate  resulting in less air being exchanged overall  This occurs because during NREM sleep the automatic  metabolic system has exclusive control over breathing and the body uses less oxygen and produces less carbon dioxide  Also  during sleep the automatic metabolic system is less responsive to carbon dioxide levels and oxygen levels in the blood  Two things result from these changes in breathing control that occur during sleep  First  there may be a brief cessation or reduction of breathing when falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes between sleep and wakefulness and their differing control mechanisms  Second  once sleep is fully obtained  there is an increase of carbon dioxide and a decrease of oxygen in the blood that persists during NREM

But that is not all that changes  During all phases of sleep  several changes in the air passages have been observed  It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater resistance to airflow in the airways and changes in the efficiency of the muscles used for breathing  Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when breathing tend to become more relaxed during sleep  especially during REM  the phase of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement   Without this muscular action  inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon the narrow passages tend to collapse  Also there is a regular cycle of change in resistance between the two sides of the nose  If something blocks the  good  side  such as congestion from allergies or a cold  then resistance increases dramatically  Coupled with these factors is the loss of the complex interactions among the muscles that can change the route of airflow from nose to mouth

Other respiratory regulating mechanisms apparently cease functioning during sleep  For example  during wakefulness   there is an immediate  automatic  adaptive increase in breathing effort when inhaling is made more difficult  such as breathing through a restrictive face mask   This reflexive adjustment is totally absent during NREM sleep  Only after several inadequate breaths under such conditions  resulting in the considerable elevation of carbon dioxide and reduction of oxygen in the blood  is breathing effort adjusted  Finally  the coughing reflex in reaction to irritants in the airway produces not a cough during sleep but a cessation of breathing  If the irritation is severe enough  a sleeping person will arouse  clear the airway  then resume breathing and likely return to sleep

Additional breathing changes occur during REM sleep that are even more dramatic than the changes that occur during NREM  The amount of air exchanged is even lower in REM than NREM because  although breathing is more rapid in REM  it is also more irregular  with brief episodes of shallow breathing or absence of breathing  In addition  breathing during REM depends much more on the action of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage action












1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following can be inferred about the diaphragm during sleep
 During sleep the diaphragm requires increased movement of the rib cage
 The diaphragm helps with breathing as movements of the rib cage decrease during sleep
 The diaphragm requires a great amount of pressure to function properly
 The diaphragm contributes to the effective functioning of the rib cage

2  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are true of the voluntary breathing system EXCEPT
 It has its control center in the brain stem
 It controls breathing for a number of activities during wakefulness
 It is able to bypass the automatic system
 It produces an irregular breathing pattern













3  The word exclusive in the passage is closest in meaning to
 consistent
 perfect
 partial
 sole

4  According to paragraph 3  which of the following may occur just before NREM sleep begins
 The automatic  metabolic system may increase its dependence on air exchanges
 Breathing can stop for a short time as a person falls asleep
 An increase in the oxygen level in the blood can occur as sleep becomes fully obtained
 The level of carbon dioxide in the blood may drop suddenly

5  What is the author s purpose in stating that inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon
 To refute the argument that additional effort is necessary for breathing during sleep
 To argue that REM sleep is more important than NREM sleep
 To illustrate the difficulty of breathing during sleep
 To illustrate how blockage of narrow passages can be prevented during sleep

6  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as being characteristic of breathing during sleep EXCEPT
 relaxation of the muscles involved in the respiratory system
 changes in resistance between the two sides of the nose
 easier airflow in the passages of the upper airway
 absence of certain complex muscle interactions


7  According to paragraph 5  what happens during NREM sleep when inhaling is difficult
 There is an immediate  automatic  adaptive increase in breathing effort
 The sleeping person takes several inadequate breaths before the breathing effort is adjusted
 The coughing reflex causes the breathing effort to adjust
 The airways become cleared as the blood removes irritants

8  It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that a very mild irritation during sleep will likely cause the sleeping person to
 increase the breathing effort
 wake up and remove the source of irritation
 cough while still sleeping
 stop breathing temporarily while still sleeping

9  The word considerable is closest in meaning to
 significant
 Steady
 Usual
 necessary

10  The word resume in the passage is closest in meaning to
 reduce
 stop
 Readjust
 restart
11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Because breathing is more shallow and irregular in REM than in NREM  less air is exchanged in REM
 Breathing in NREM is less effective than breathing in REM because of irregular episodes of rapid breathing during NREM
 Because breathing is more rapid in NREM sleep than in REM sleep  breathing often becomes shallow
 Although REM has brief episodes of shallow breathing or lack of breathing  breathing is more rapid than in NREM
