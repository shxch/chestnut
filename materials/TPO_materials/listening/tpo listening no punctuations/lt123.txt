Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class

Ok  as we ve talked about a key aspect of running a successful business is knowing  um  getting a good sense of what the customer actually wants  and how they perceive your product  So with that in mind  I want to describe a very simple method of researching customer preference  and it is becoming increasingly common  it s called    MBWA    which stands for managing by wandering around  Now  MBWA  that s not the most technical sounding name you ve ever heard  but it describes the process pretty accurately  Here is how it works

Basically  Um  the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers  and learn more about how well the business is serving their needs  and try to see what the customer experiences  because that s a great way to discover for yourself  how your product is perceived  what its strengths and weaknesses are  you know  how you can improve it    that sort of thing  You know Dortans  they make soup and canned vegetables and such  Well  the head of the company had Dortans  top executives walk around supermarkets  um  asking shoppers what they thought of Dortans  soups  and he used that data to make changes to the company s product  I mean  when Dortans of all the companies  embraces something as radical as MBWA  it really shows you how popular the theory has become  yes  Lisa

Student A
But isn t it dangerous to base decisions on information from a small sample of people  Isn t large scale market research safer getting data on a lot of people

Professor
That s a good question  and well I don t want to pretend that Wâ€¦ MBWA is some sort of  um  replacement for other methods of customer research  Now  market research data definitely can give you a good idea of  um  of the big picture  but MBWA is really useful  it kind of filling in the blanks  you know  getting a good underground sense of how your products are used  and how people need to respond to them  and Yes  the numbers of opinion you get is small so you do need to be careful  but  good business managers will tell you that the big fear they have and    and one of the most frequent problems they come across is well becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need  you know  surveys and market research stuff like that  they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day to day lives  Managing by wandering around  on the other hand  well  that gets you in there and gives you a good sense of what customers need  So     so when using combination then  MBWA and market research  well  they are powerful tools

Oh  here is another example for you  uh  senior executives for a clothing manufacturer  It was  um  Lken  Lken jeans you know  they went and worked in a store for a few days  selling Lken s cloths  Now that gave them a very different idea about their product  they saw how people responded to it  they could go up to customers in the store and ask them questions about it  uh  yes Mike

Student B
Well  I would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by  you know  if I m shopping  I don t know if I d want some business representative coming up to me and asking me questions  it s   It s like when I get phone calls at home from market researchers  I just hang up on them Professor Oh  well  it s certainly true that well no one likes getting calls at home from market researchers or people like that  but I will tell you something  Most customers have the exact opposite reaction when it comes to MBWA  Now  don t ask me why  because I really have no idea  but the fact is that customers tend to respond really well to MBWA  which is the key reason for its success

In fact  the techniques of MBWA work so well  they have actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts  like politics for instance  Um  a few years back  the mayor of Baltimore  Um   I think his name was Sheaffer or something like that  Anyway  he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city  of his city  was to actually get out there in it and experience the things that they experienced  so he d ride around the city in  well  you know  in all parts of it  and he d see all the potholes  he d see how the trash was sometimes  um  not picked up off the side of the street and then he d go back to his office and he d write these memos  now they were memos to his staff about the problems he had seen  and how they needed to be fixed  you know that sort of thing  but the thing is he got all this information just by going around and seeing the different Baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them  Now he called it    smart politics  we d call it MBWA  or just  playing good customer service
