OK  Last time we talked about photosynthesis  the process by which plants use light to convert carbon dioxide and water into food  Today I want to talk about another way light affects plants  I am sure you all know from physics class about how light moves in microscopic ways and that we can only see light when the wavelength of that light is in a specific range  Plus  depending on the wavelengths  we see different colors

Well  plants are also capable of distinguishing between different wavelengths of light  Now  I don t want to confuse you  It is not like plants have eyes  Plants don t see in the sense that humans or animals do  but they do have photoreceptors

Photoreceptors are cells that respond to light by sending out a chemical signal  And the organism  the plant  reacts to this signal  In fact  the signals that plants get from their photoreceptors sometimes cause significant reactions

And many plants are seasonal  And one way they know when winter is ending and spring is beginning is by sensing the change in light  The time when an adult plant flowers is based on the amount of light the plant senses  Certain plant species won t flower if they sense too much light and some plants will only flower if they sense a specific amount of light  Of course  these aren t conscious reactions  These plants just automatically respond to light in certain ways

Plants are also able to distinguish between specific wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot even see  Specifically there s a wavelength called far red  Although why they call it far red … I mean  it is not red at all  It lies in the infrared range of the spectrum  We can t see it  but plants can sense it as a different wavelength

OK  Now I need to mention another thing about photosynthesis  I didn t explain how different wavelengths of light affect photosynthesis  When a plant absorbs light for performing photosynthesis  it only absorbs some wavelengths of light and reflects others  Plants absorb most of the red light that hits them  but plants only absorb some of the far red light that hits them  They reflect the rest  Remember this  because it s going to be relevant in an experiment I want to discuss

This fascinating experiment showed that plants not only detect and react to specific wavelengths of light  plants can also detect and react to changes in the ratio of one wavelength to another  This experiment was called the Pampas experiment

The idea behind the Pampas experiment had to do with the response of plants to changes in the ratio of red light to far red light that the plants sense with their photoreceptors  Some biologists hypothesize that a plant will stop growing if it s in the shade of another plant  a reaction that s triggered when it senses an unusual ratio of red light to far red light  OK

Imagine there are two plants  One below the other  The plant on top would absorb most of the red light for photosynthesis  but reflect most of the far red light  That would lead to the plant in its shade sensing an unusual ratio  There will be less red light and more far red light than normal

What that ratio signifies is important  A ratio of less red and to more far red light would cause a reaction from the plant  It would stop growing taller  because that plant would sense that it wasn t going to get enough sunlight to provide the energy to grow large

To test their hypothesis  researchers took some electrical lights  um… actually  they were light emitting diodes  or LEDs  These light emitting diodes could simulate red light  So they put these LEDs around some plants that were in the shade  The LEDs produce light that the plants sensed as red  But  unlike sunlight  the light from these LEDs did not support photosynthesis  So the plants sensed the proper ratio of red light to far red light and reacted by continuing to grow taller  while in reality these plants were not getting enough energy from photosynthesis to support all of that growth  And because they weren t getting enough energy to support their growth  most of the shaded plants died after a short time
