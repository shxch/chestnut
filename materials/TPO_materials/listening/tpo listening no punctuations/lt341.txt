Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university library
Librarian
Ready to check out
Student
Just about  Before I do though  this book on early navigation…I have been using this book quite a bit for a research project  And I would like to own it actually  And well…it s an old book  and there were two copies on the shelf just now  so I was wondering if I could buy one  I was talking to this guy the other day  and he said the library sold books on occasion  Is that right
Librarian
He is probably talking about our annual book sale  We have one every spring
Student
OK  How do you decide which books to sell  Are they duplicates
Librarian
A lot are duplicates  If we have more than one copy of a title and it hasn t been checked out in a few years  in that case it might end up at the sale
Student
I ve actually tried to find this book online but no luck so far  I was really hoping to buy it
Librarian
Well  that particular book…well  it probably won t be up for sale this year  Most books in the sale come from off site storage

Student
Off site storage
Librarian
That s where we keep books that haven t been used for several years  They are still in the catalog  which means they can be checked out if you fill out a form  It takes maybe a day or two to retrieve one of them
Student
I see
Librarian
And then before we decide to include a book in the sale  we review its circulation history again  which can take a while  We ve got a lot of books in storage
Student
So it s basically the unpopular books that get put up for sale then
Librarian
Well  that…plus the main thing is to make sure students have access to the information in the books  A lot of them are available in electronic format these days  even the really old ones  You know  they have been preserved that way
Student
So most of the books for sale are older books
Librarian
Well  we get book donations too  And lots of those are new  Again  a librarian reviews them and decides whether to catalogue them or put them up for sale
Student
Is this sale open to the public

Librarian
On the second day  It s a two day sale  The first day is for students  faculty and staff though  which is great  We usually need about twenty volunteers for the sale  And well  if you volunteer  you get first shot at everything in advance
Student
Really  What do volunteers have to do
Librarian
You help sort the books and set up the tables  But keep in mind those positions fill up quickly
Now  about this particular book  it wouldn t hurt to send a formal request to the collection department  They might be able to let you know if it would be up for sale
Student
I ll do that  Thanks
