TPO23 Lecture3 Biology  Dolphins
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class
Professor  We have been talking about how sea animals find their way underwater  how they navigate  and this brings up an interesting puzzle  and one I m sure you ll all enjoy  I mean  everybody loves dolphins  right
And dolphins  well  they actually produce two types of sounds  Uh  one being the vocalizations you are probably all familiar with  which they emit through their blowholes  But the one we are concerned with today is the rapid clicks that they use for echolocation  so they can sense what is around them  These sounds  it has been found  are produced in the air filled nasal sacs of the dolphin
And the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into the water  It s not as easy as it might seem  You see  the denser the medium  the faster sound travels  So sound travels faster through water than it does through air  So what happens when a sound wave um   OK
You ve got a sound wave traveling merrily along through one medium  when suddenly  it hits a different medium  what does gonna happen then  Well  some of the energy is going to be reflected back  and some of it is going to be transmitted into the second medium  And   and   and if the two media have really different densities  like air and water  then most of the energy is going to be reflected back  very little of it will keep going  uh  get transmitted into the new medium  I mean  just think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater
So  how did the dolphin s clicks get transmitted from its air filled nasal sacs into the ocean water  Because given the difference in density between the air in the nasal cavity and the seawater  we d expect those sounds to just kind of go bouncing around inside the dolphin s head  which will do it no good at all  If it s going to navigate it  needs those sounds to be broadcast and bounced back from objects in its path
Well  turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads  just in front of their nasal sacs  called a melon  Now  the melon is kind of a large sac like pouch  made up of fat tissue  And this fat tissue has some rather fascinating acoustical properties  Most of the fat that you find in an animal s body is used for storing energy  but this fat  which you find in dolphins  and only in the melon and around the lower jaw  This fat is very different  very rich in oil  And it turns out it has a very different purpose as well
Now  one way to um  modify the overcome this mismatch in the density of air and water would be   if you travels through velocity of the sound wave  make it precisely match the speed at which water  And that s exactly what marine biologists have discovered the melon Note that the bursa  these little projections at the rear of the melon  are right up against the air filled nasal sacs  And these bursa  it turns out  are what s responsible for transferring sound to the melon
The sound waves are then transmitted by the bursa through the melon  First through a low velocity core  and then through a high velocity shell  where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater  So now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water  with minimal reflection
The only other place  this special fatty tissue  like that in the melon  the only other place is found in the dolphin  is in the lower jaw  Turns out that the lower jaw  well  it is made of a specially thin bone  And it is very sensitive to vibrations  to sound energy traveling through the seawater  It turns out that the jaw is primarily responsible for capturing and transferring returning sound waves to the dolphin s inner ear  So these rapid clicks that are sent out bounce off objects  maybe a group of fish swimming over here  a boat coming from over there  The sounds bounce off them and the lower jaw captures the returning sounds  making it possible for the dolphin to sense what s in the surrounding water and decide where to swim
