Listen to part of a lecture in a class on theater history  The professor is discussing the theater of 19th century France

Pro  The 19th century was the time that saw what we called Realism developed in the European theater  Umâ€¦ to understand this though  we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well made play  which basically was a pattern for constructing plays  plays that    uh   beginning with some early 19th century comedies in France proved very successful commercially

The dramatic devices used here weren t actually anything new  They had been around for centuries  But the formula for a well made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a particular order  And most importantly  that everything in the plays be logically connected  In fact  some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning  just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before

Ok  so what are the necessary elements of a well made play

Well  the first is logical exposition  Exposition is whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience  So  they ll understand what is going on  Before this time  exposition might have come from actors simply giving speeches  Someone might walk out on a stage and say   In fair Verona where we lay our scene   and then tell all about the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet  But for the well made play  even the exposition had to be logical  believable  So  for example  you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house  And one says  Oh  what a shame the master s son is still not married  And the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who s just moved into town with his beautiful daughter  These comments are part of the play s logical exposition

The next key element of the a well made play is referred to as the inciting incident  After we have the background information  we need a key moment that gets things moving  that really makes the audience interested in what happens to the characters we just heard about  So  for example  after the two servants reveal all this background information  we meet the young man  Just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman  and immediately falls in love  This is the inciting incident  It sets off  the plot of the play

Now  the plot of a well made play is usually driven by secrets  Things that the audience knows  but the characters often don t know  So  for example  the audience learns through a letter or through someone else s conversation who this mysterious gentleman is and why he left the town many years before  But the young man doesn t know about this  And the woman doesn t understand the ancient connection between her family and his

And before the secrets are revealed to the main characters  the plot of the play proceeds as a series of sort of up and down moments  For example  the woman first appears not to even notice the young man  and it seems to him like the end of the world  But then  he learns that she actually wants to meet him too  So  life is wonderful  Then  if he tries to talk with her  maybe her father get furious  for no apparent reason  So  they can t see each other  But  just as the young man has almost lost all hope  he finds out  well you get the idea  the reversals of fortune continue  increasing the audience s tension and excitement  making them wonder if everything is going to come out okay or not

Next comesan element known as the  obligatory scene  It s a scene  a moment in which all the secrets are revealed  And generally  things turn out well for the hero and others we care about  a happy ending of some sort  This became so popular that a playwright almost had to include it in every play  which is why it s called  the obligatory scene

And that s followed by the final dramatic element   the denouement or the resolution  when all the loose ends have to be tied up in a logical way  Remember  the obligatory scene gives the audience emotional pleasure  But the denouement offers the audience a logical conclusion  That s the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind

So  as I said  the well made play  this form of playwriting  became the basis for realism in drama  and for a lot of very popular 19th century plays  And also  a pattern we find in the plots of many later plays and even movies that we see today
