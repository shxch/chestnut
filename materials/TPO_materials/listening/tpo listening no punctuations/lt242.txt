TPO 24 Lecture l Biology  Crocodile Vocalization
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class
Professor  OK  For today  let s look at a reptile  a predator that hasn t evolved much in the last seventy million years  No discussion of reptiles would be complete without some mention of crocodiles
Now  we tend to think of crocodiles as  uh  kind of solitary  hiding out in a swamp  uh  kind of mysterious creatures  But we are finding out that they aren t as isolated as they seem  In fact  crocodiles interact with each other in a variety of ways  One way is with vocalizations  you know  sounds generated by the animal  This is true of the whole crocodile family  which includes crocodiles themselves  alligators  etc
Take American alligators  If you were to go to a swamp during the breeding season  you d hear a chorus of sounds  deep grunts  hisses  these are sounds that male alligators make
And some of them are powerful enough to make the water vibrate  This sends a strong  go away message to the other males  So the alligator can focus on sending other sound waves through the water  sound waves that you and I couldn t even hear since they are at such low frequency  But they do reach the female alligator  who then goes to find and mate with the male
Vocalization is um   well  it is used for other reasons  like getting attention or just  um    letting others know you are distressed  Let s see  New born crocodiles  or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers  When they are born  croc    baby crocodiles have a sort of muffled cry while they are in their nest  Hatchlings are really vulnerable  especially to birds and small mammals when they are born  But their mother  who has been keeping vigil nearby  hears their cry for help and carries them to safety  meaning  to water
So she takes them out of the nest  Uh  uh  all the eggs hatched at once  so she has about forty newborns to look after  Well  she takes about fifteen out of the nest at a time  carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water  While she is taking one load of hatchlings  the others wait for her to come back
But do you think they are quiet about it  No way  They are clamoring for the mother s attention  sort of squeaking and practically saying don t forget about me
I heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week  Anyone catched it  It had a few interesting bits  But you know  uh  you have to be careful  think critically  Sometimes I don t know where these shows find their experts
Student  Excuse me  But  um    does all that crying defeat the purpose  I mean  doesn t it attract more predators
Professor  Hmm   good question  I guess  well  I am guessing that once the babies have the mother s attention  they are safe  She s never too far away  and  and I think   I mean  would you mess with a mother crocodile
So after the mother transports all the youngsters  they still call to each other  and to their mother  This communication continues right through to adulthood  Crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make
There s   um   umâ€¦ you have deep grunting sounds  hisses  growls  are many different sounds to interact or send messages  This is more typical of mammals than of reptiles  I mean  crocodiles  brains are the most developed of any reptile  In that sense  they are closer to mammals  brains than other reptiles  brains  And we know that mammals  dogs for example  dogs vocalize many different sounds  Crocodiles have a similar level of  uh  vocal sophistication  if you will  which makes them unique among reptiles
Another thing would be  um  if a hatchling gets separated from the rest of its family  once the others get far enough away  its survival instinct kicks in  It will make a loud distress call  which its siblings answer  It calls again  And they continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again
Another thing  something that wasn t on that TV show I mentioned  Um    mother crocodiles lead their young from one area to another  like when they have to find a different source of water  Usually she will lead them at night  when it is safer for them  moving ahead and then letting out calls of reassurance so that they will follow her  Her voice helps give the babies the courage they need to leave the area and go some place that s a more desirable home for them
