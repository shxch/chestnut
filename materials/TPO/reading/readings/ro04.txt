Early Cinema
The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial  peepshow  format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater  In the peepshow format  a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose  Thomas Edison s peepshow device  the Kinetoscope  was introduced to the public in 1894  It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors  or arcades  which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short  50 foot film at any one time  The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines  For the price of 25 cents  or 5 cents per machine   customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films  or  in the case of famous prizefights  successive rounds of a single fight
These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors  which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier  In the phonograph parlors  customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes  moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music  The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way  Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes  for roughly $1 000 apiece  to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them  which cost approximately $10 to $15 each   He refused to develop projection technology  reasoning that if he made and sold projectors  then exhibitors would purchase only one machine a projector from him instead of several
Exhibitors  however  wanted to maximize their profits  which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time  rather than one at a time  and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission  About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894  showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere  Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins  and Orville and Woodville Latham  with the assistance of Edison s former assistant  William Dickson  perfected projection devices  These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters  legitimate theaters  local town halls  makeshift storefront theaters  fairgrounds  and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience
With the advent of projection in 1895 1896  motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption  Previously  large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater  where vaudeville  popular dramas  musical and minstrel shows  classical plays  lectures  and slide and lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time  But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment  which depended on either live performance or  in the case of the slide and lantern shows  the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program
Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts  the substance of the movies themselves is mass produced  prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor  Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures  their creative control remained limited  What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies  the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains  of waves striking the shore  and of people walking in the street  and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera
With the advent of projection  the viewer s relationship with the image was no longer private  as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope  which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid  It suddenly became public an experience that the viewer shared with dozens  scores  and even hundreds of others  At the same time  the image that the spectator looked at expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches  in height  to the life size proportions of 6 or 9 feet
