 It was not until the Cambrian period  beginning about 600 million years ago  that a great proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to track the rise and fall of biodiversity  Since the Cambrian period  biodiversity has generally risen  but there have been some notable exceptions  Biodiversity collapsed dramatically during at least five periods because of mass extinctions around the globe  The five major mass extinctions receive most of the attention  but they are only one end of a spectrum of extinction events  Collectively  more species went extinct during smaller events that were less dramatic but more frequent  The best known of the five major extinction events  the one that saw the demise of the dinosaurs  is the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction

Starting about 280 million years ago  reptiles were the dominant large animals in terrestrial environments  In popular language this was the era  when dinosaurs ruled Earth   when a wide variety of reptile species occupying many ecological niches  However  no group or species can maintain its dominance indefinitely  and when  after over 200 million years  the age of dinosaurs came to a dramatic end about 65 million years ago  mammals began to flourish  evolving from relatively few types of small terrestrial animals into the myriad of diverse species  including bats and whales  that we know today  Paleontologists label this point in Earth s history as the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Tertiary period  often abbreviated as the K T boundary  This time was also marked by changes in many other types of organisms  Overall  about 38 percent of the families of marine animals were lost  with percentages much higher in some groups Ammonoid mollusks went from being very diverse and abundant to being extinct  An extremely abundant set of planktonic marine animals called foraminifera largely disappeared  although they rebounded later  Among plants  the K T boundary saw a sharp but brief rise in the abundance of primitive vascular plants such as ferns  club mosses  horsetails  and conifers and other gymnosperms  The number of flowering plants  angiosperms  was reduced at this time  but they then began to increase dramatically

 What caused these changes  For many years scientists assumed that a cooling of the climate was responsible  with dinosaurs being particularly vulnerable because  like modern reptiles  they were ectothermic  dependent on environmental heat  or cold blooded   It is now widely believed that at least some species of dinosaurs had a metabolic rate high enough for them to be endotherms  animals that maintain a relatively consistent body temperature by generating heat internally   Nevertheless  climatic explanations for the K T extinction are not really challenged by the ideas that dinosaurs may have been endothermic  because even endotherms can be affected by a significant change in the climate

Explanations for the K T extinction were revolutionized in 1980 when a group of physical scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed that 65 million years ago Earth was stuck by a 10 kilometer wide meteorite traveling at 90 000 kilometers per hour  They believed that this impact generated a thick cloud of dust that enveloped Earth  shutting out much of the incoming solar radiation and reducing plant photosynthesis to very low levels  Short term effects might have included huge tidal waves and extensive fires  In other words  a series of events arising from a single cataclysmic event caused the massive extinctions  Initially  the meteorite theory was based on a single line of evidence  At locations around the globe  geologists had found an unusually high concentration of iridium in the layer of sedimentary rocks that was formed about 65 million years ago  Iridium is an element that is usually uncommon near Earth s surface  but it is abundant in some meteorites  Therefore  Alvarez and his colleagues concluded that it was likely that the iridium in sedimentary rocks deposited at the K T boundary had originated in a giant meteorite or asteroid  Most scientist came to accept the meteorite theory after evidence came to light that a circular formation  180 kilometers in diameter in diameter and centered on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula  was created by a meteorite impact about 65 million years ago
 


1  The word  proliferation  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 decline
 extinction
 increase
 migration

2  Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about life on Earth before the Cambrian period
 Biodiversity levels were steady  as indicated by the fossil record
 Levels of biodiversity could not be tracked
 The most dramatic extinction episode occurred
 Few microscopic species existed


3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The dominance of dinosaurs came to an end 65 million years ago  at which time mammals began to flourish and diversify
 Because no group of species can remain dominant forever  mammals became the dominant group when dinosaurs became extinct
 After being the dominant group for more than 200 million years  the age of dinosaurs came to a dramatic end 65 million years ago
 The diverse group of mammals that we know today  including bats and whales  evolved from small terrestrial forms that had been dominated by dinosaurs

4  According to paragraph 2  why dinosaurs are popularly said to have  ruled Earth  during the Cretaceous period
 Dinosaurs were the only species of reptile that existed during the whole of the Cretaceous period
 Dinosaurs won the battle for food resources over mammals during the Cretaceous period
 Dinosaurs survived extinction during the Cretaceous period  whereas many other animal species did not
 Dinosaurs were the physically and ecologically dominant animals during the Cretaceous period

5  According to paragraph 2  which of the following species initially increased in number at the K T boundary
 Dinosaurs
 Foraminifera
 Ferns
 Ammonoid mollusks


6  Why does the author note that  even endotherms can be affected by a significant change in the climate
 To argue that there was a significant climate at the time that endothermic dinosaurs became extinct
 To argue that climate change caused some dinosaurs to evolve as endotherms
 To support the view that at least some of the dinosaurs that became extinct were endotherms
 To defend climate change as possible explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs 


7  The word  generated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 collected
 produced
 spread
 added

8  The word  extensive  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 widespread
 sudden
 numerous
 subsequent

9  According to paragraph 4  all of the following contributed to the massive extinctions of the K T period EXCEPT
 tidal waves
 fires
 insufficient solar radiation
 iridium

10  According to paragraph 4  which of the following statements explains the importance of the discovery of high levels of iridium rocks
 It provided evidence that overexposure to solar radiation led to the K T extinction
 It showed that more than one cataclysmic event was responsible for the K T extinction
 It suggested that the cause of the K T extinction may have been a meteorite striking Earth
 It provided evidence that the K T extinction occurred 65 million years ago

11  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true about the Yucatan Peninsula
 The circular formation there was caused by a meteorite impact 65 million years ago
 Sedimentary rocks from that area have the lowest iridium concentration of any rocks on Earth
 There is evidence that a huge tidal wave occurred there 65 million years ago
 Evidence found there challenged the meteorite impact theory

12  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about the meteorite theory
 The data originally presented as evidence for the theory were eventually rejected
 Many scientists did not accept it when it was first proposed
 It has not been widely accepted as an explanation for the K T extinction
 Alvarez subsequently revised it after a circular formation was found in the Yucatan Peninsula

The K t extinction 65 million years ago is the best known of the five major extinction episodes since the Cambrian period






Answer Choices
 Collectively  the five major extinction episodes resulted in the elimination of a larger number of  species than did all the minor extinction events
 The K T extinction eliminated the dinosaurs and Ammonoid mollusks but was followed by the diversification of mammals and gymnospermous plants
 An extreme cooling of the climate could not have caused the K T extinction of dinosaurs  because  while most dinosaurs depended on environmental heat  some did not
 The K T extinction of the dinosaurs is the only mass extinction that has been explained by the impact of a meteorite
 In1980 Luis Alvarez proposed that the K T extinction was caused by ecological disasters brought about by the impact of a meteorite striking Earth
 A high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rocks at the K T boundary and a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula from 65 million years ago strongly support Alvarez  hypothesis
