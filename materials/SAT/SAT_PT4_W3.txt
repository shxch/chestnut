and supplementary material.
You Are Where You Say
Research on regional variations in English-language
use has not only yielded answers to such 23 life-altering
questions as how people in different parts of the
United States refer to carbonated beverages (“soda”?
“pop”? “coke”?) 24 it also illustrates how technology can
change the very nature of research. While traditional,
human-intensive data collection 25 has all but
disappeared in language studies, the explosion of social
media has opened new avenues for investigation.
[1] Perhaps the epitome of traditional methodology
is the Dictionary of American Regional English,
colloquially known as DARE. [2] Its fifth and final
alphabetical volume—ending with “zydeco”—released in
2012, the dictionary represents decades of arduous work.
[3] Over a six-year period from 1965 to 1970, university
graduate students conducted interviews in more than a
thousand communities across the nation. [4] Their goal

rainstorm (variously a “gully washer,” “pour-down,” or
“stump mover”). [5] The work that dictionary founder
Frederic G. Cassidy had expected to be finished by 1976
was not, in fact, completed in his lifetime. [6] The wait
did not dampen enthusiasm among 26 scholars.
Scholars consider the work a signal achievement in
linguistics. 27
Not all research into regional English varieties
28 requires such time, effort, and resources, however.
Today’s researchers have found that the veritable army of
trained volunteers traveling the country conducting
face-to-face interviews can sometimes be 29 replaced by
another army the vast array of individuals volunteering
details about their lives—and, inadvertently, their
language—through social media. Brice Russ of Ohio State
University, for example, has employed software to sort
through postings on one social media 30 cite in search
of particular words and phrases of interest as well as the
location from which users are posting. From these data,
