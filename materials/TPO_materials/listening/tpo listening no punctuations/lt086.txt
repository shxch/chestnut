TPO8 Lecture 4 Chemistry
Pro  So  are there any questions

Student  Yes  um  Professor Harrison  you were saying that the periodic table is predictive  What exactly does that mean  I mean I understand how it organizes the elements but where s the prediction

Pro  Ok  let s look at our periodic table again  Ok  it groups elements into categories that share certain properties  right

Stu  Uh huh

Pro  And it is arranged according to increasing atomic number  which is…

Student  The number of protons in each atom of an element

Pro  Right  well  early versions of the periodic table had gaps  missing elements  Every time you had one more proton  you had another element  And then  oops  there d be an atomic number  for which there was no known element  And the prediction was that an element with that atomic number existed somewhere  but it just hadn t been found yet  And its location in the table would tell you what properties it should have  It was really pretty exciting for scientists at that time to find these missing elements and confirm their predictive properties

Um  actually  that reminds of a     of a very good example of all these  element 43  See on the table  the symbols for elements 42 and 44  Well  in early versions of the table  there was no symbol for an element 43 protons because no element with 43 protons had been discovered yet  So the periodic table had a gap between elements 42 and 44

And then in 1925  a team of chemists led by a scientist named Ida Tacke claimed that they had found element 43  They had been using a relatively new technology called X ray spectroscopy  and they were using this to examine an ore sample  And they claimed that they d found an element with 43 protons  And they named it Masurium

Student  Um  Professor Harrison  then  how come in my periodic table here  element 43 is Tc  that s Technetium  right

Pro  Ok  let me add that  Actually  um  that s the point I m coming to  Hardly anyone believed that Tacke d discovered a new element  X ray spectroscopy was a new method at that time  And they were never able to isolate enough Masurium to have a weighable sample to convince everyone of the discovery  So they were discredited

But then  12 years later in 1937  a different team became the first to synthesize an element using a cyclotron  And that element had…

Student  43 protons

Pro  That s right  but they named it Technetium to emphasize that it was artificially created with technology  And people thought that synthesizing this element  making it artificially was the only way to get it  We still hadn t found it occuring in nature
Now element 43  whether you call it Masurium or Technetium  is radioactive  Why does that matter  What is true of a radioactive element

Student  It decays  it turns into other elements  Oh  so does that explain why it was missing in the periodic table

Pro  Exactly  because of its radioactive decay  element 43 doesn t last very long  And therefore  if that ever had been present on Earth  it would have decayed ages ago  So the Masurium people were obviously wrong  and the Technetium people were right  Right  Well  that was then  now we know that element 43 does occur naturally  It can be naturally generated from Uranium atoms that have spontaneously split  And guess what  the ore sample the Masurium group was working with had plenty of Uranium in it enough to split into measurable amounts of Masurium  So Tacke s team might very well have found small amounts of Masurium in the ore sample  It s just that once was generated from split Uranium  it decayed very quickly

And you know here s an incredible irony  Ida Tacke  the chemist led the Masurium team  well  she was the first to suggest that Uranium could break up into smaller pieces  but she didn t know that that was the defense of her own discovery of element 43

Student  So is my version of the periodic table wrong  Should element 43 really be called Masurium

Pro  Maybe  but you know it s hard to tell for sure after all this time  if Ida Tacke s group did discover element 43  They didn t  um  publish enough detail on their methods or instruments for us to know for sure  But I d like to think element 43 was discovered twice  As Masurium  it was the first element discovered that occurs in nature only from spontaneous fission  and as Technetium  it was the first element discovered in a laboratory  And of course  it was an element the periodic table let us to expect existed before anyone had found it or made it
