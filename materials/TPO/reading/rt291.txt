Characteristics of Roman Pottery

The pottery of ancient Romans is remarkable in several ways  The high quality of Roman pottery is very easy to appreciate when handling actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae  the large jars used throughout the Mediterranean for the transport and storage of liquids  such as wine and oil   However  it is impossible to do justice to Roman wares on the page  even when words can be backed up by photographs and drawing  Most Roman pottery is light and smooth to touch and very tough  although  like all pottery  it shatters if dropped on a hard surface  It is generally made with carefully selected and purified clay  worked to thin walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a kiln  pottery oven  capable of ensuring a consistent finish  With handmade pottery  inevitably there are slight differences between individual vessels of the same design and occasional minor blemishes  flaws   But what strikes the eye and the touch most immediately and most powerfully with Roman pottery is its consistent high quality
This is not just an aesthetic consideration but also a practical one  These vessels are solid  brittle  but not fragile   they are pleasant and easy to handle  being light and smooth   and  with their hard and sometimes glossy  smooth and shiny  surfaces  they hold liquids well and are easy to wash  Furthermore  their regular and standardized shapes would have made them simple to stack and store  When people today are shown a very ordinary Roman pot and  in particular  are allowed to handle it  they often comment on how modern it looks and feels  and they need to be convinced of its true age
As impressive as the quality of Roman pottery is its sheer massive quantity  When considering quantities  we would ideally like to have some estimates for overall production from particular sites of pottery manufacture and for overall consumption at specific settlements  Unfortunately  it is in the nature of the archaeological evidence  which is almost invariable only a sample of what once existed  that such figures will always be elusive  However  no one who has ever worked in the field would question the abundance of Roman pottery  particularly in the Mediterranean region  This abundance is notable in Roman settlements  especially urban sites  where the labor that archaeologists have to put into the washing and sorting of potsherds  fragments of pottery  constitutes a high proportion of the total work during the initial phases of excavation
Only rarely can we derive any  real  quantities from deposits of broken pots  However  there is one exceptional dump  which does represent a very large part of the site s total history of consumption and for which an estimate of quantity has been produced  On the left bank of the Tiber River in Rome  by one of the river ports of the ancient city  is a substantial hill some 50 meters high called Monte Testaccio  It is made up entirely of broken oil amphorae  mainly of the second and third centuries A D  It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae  in which around 6 000million liters of oil were imported into the city from overseas  Imports into imperial Rome were supported by the full might of the state and were therefore quite exceptional   but the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio  and the productivity and complexity that lay behind them  nonetheless cannot fail to impress   This was a society with similarities to modern one    moving goods on a gigantic scale  manufacturing high quality containers to do so  and occasionally  as here  even discarding them on delivery
Roman pottery was transported not only in large quantities but also over substantial distances  Many Roman pots  in particular amphorae and the fine wares designed for use at tables  could travel hundreds of miles    all over the Mediterranean and also further afield  But maps that show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story  What is more significant than any geographical spread is the access that different levels of society had to good quality products  In all but the remotest regions of the empire  Roman pottery of a high standard is common at the sites of humble villages and isolated farmsteads


1  Paragraph 1 indicates which of the following about Roman pottery
  Roman amphorae were of much higher quality overall than other Roman pottery
  Roman pottery can best be appreciated when actual pieces are handled
  Roman pottery declined slightly in quality when the use of fast wheels and kilns was introduced
  Roman practical tableware spread more rapidly across the Mediterranean than amphorae did
2  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as characteristics of Roman pottery EXCEPT
  It was usually made with high quality clay
  It generally did not weigh much
  It did not break as easily as other ancient pottery
  It sometimes had imperfections
3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is NOT true of Roman vessels
  They were good containers for liquids
  Their shapes allowed for easy stacking and storing
  They sometimes had shiny surfaces
  Their true age is immediately apparent
4  The author mentions the work of archaeologists in paragraph 3 in order to
  support the idea that pottery was produced in large quantities by the Romans
  illustrate how hard it is for archaeologists to find complete pieces of Roman pottery
  contrast archaeological sites in Roman urban areas with other sites in the Mediterranean
  explain why the quantities of pottery found vary significantly from one site to another

5  The word  substantial  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  protected
  man made
  large
  famous

6  According to paragraph 4  Monte Testaccio is particularly important for archaeologists because archaeologists were able to
  conclude how amphorae manufacturing increased rapidly after the second century A D
  find the locations where most of the amphorae in the Roman Empire were produced
  obtain relatively accurate calculations of the quantities of amphorae used over time in that place
  discover that the Roman state had supported amphorae production

7  The word  entirely  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  apparently
  completely
  basically
  mostly

8  Paragraph 4 indicates which of the following about the port on the Tiber River near Monte Testaccio
  It was built around the third century A D
  It was close to areas where large quantities of oil were produced
  It was in use only for a very short period of time
  It had impressive level of commercial activity

9  The statement in paragraph 4 that amphorae delivered to the port near Monte Testaccio were occasionally discarded support which of the following
  Traders at the port were often careless
  The quality of the amphorae used at the port was not very good
  The scale of the trade made it possible to waste quality amphorae sometimes
  The importing of oil from overseas gradually declined  reducing the need for pottery containers






10  The statement that  maps show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story  makes the point that
  maps indicate where specific pottery styles have been found  but they do not indicate where these styles originated
  maps show the geographical spread of Roman pottery but not the people who had access to it
  maps do not usually include pottery styles found in the remotest regions the Roman Empire
  archaeologist studying Roman pottery need to use a range of techniques in their investigations

11  The word  humble  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  rural
  distant
  ancient
  modest

12  The word  particular  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  specific
  common
  ancient
  superior


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
That is because residents of a city did not usually discard used pottery at the same site over a long period of time
Where would the sentence best fit

The pottery of the ancient Roman Empire is remarkable












Answer Choices

  Roman pottery is considered to be practical and of consistently high quality
  Roman pottery was transported over long distances  and different levels of society had access to quality pottery
  Archaeologists looking for the remains of Roman pottery concentrate on urban sites because that is where the oldest pieces of kitchenware and amphorae have been found
  Even though the exact quantity of pottery produced by the Romans is almost impossible to calculate  it is certain that is was produced in large quantities
  People are not familiar with the whole range of pottery of Romans created because most of the available pieces represent only a limited number of styles and shapes
  It is still unclear to archaeologists what the role of the Roman state in the commercial success of Roman pottery was
