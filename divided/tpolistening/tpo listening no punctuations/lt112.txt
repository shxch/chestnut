Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology Class  The class has been learning
about birds

Professor
Ok  today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors
of birds  And we are going to start by talking about what are known as
distraction displays

Now if you are a bird and there is a predator around
What are you going to do  Well  for one thing you are going to try to attract as little attention as possible  right  Because if the predator doesn t know you are there  it is not going to try to eat you  But sometimes certain species of birds do the exact opposite  When a predator approaches  they do their best to attract the attention of that predator

Now why would they do that  Well  they
do that to draw the predator away from their nest  away from their eggs or their young birds  And the behaviors that the birds engage in to distract predators are called distraction displays  And there are a number of different kinds of distraction displays

Most of the time  when birds are engaging in distraction displays  they are going to be pretending either that they have an injury or that they re ill or that they re exhausted  You know something that ll make the predator think  Ahâ€¦ here is an easy meal

One pretty common
distraction display is what s called the broken wing display  And in a broken wing display  the bird spreads and drags a wings or its tail  and while it does that  it slowly moves away from the nests  So it really looks like a bird with a broken wing  And these broken wing displays can be pretty convincing

Another version of this kind of distraction display is where the bird creates the impression of a mouse or some other small animals that s running along the ground  A good example of that kind of display is created by a bird called the purple sandpiper

Now what s the purple sandpiper does is when a predator approaches  it drags its wings but not to give the impression that its wing is broken but to create the illusion that it has a second pair of legs  And then it raises its feathers  so it looks like it s got a coat of fur  And then it runs along the ground swerving left and right  you know like it s running around little rocks and sticks  And as it goes along  it makes this little squealing noise  So from a distance it really looks and sounds like a little animal running along the ground trying to get away  Again to the predator  it looks like an easy meal

Now what s interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these distraction displays  They don t give their top performance  their prime time performance every time  What they do is they save their best performances  their most conspicuous and most risky displays for the time just before the baby birds become able to take care of themselves  And they time it that way because that s when they ll have made the greatest investment in parenting their young  So they are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs  because they haven t invested that much time or energy in parenting yet  The top performances are going to come later

Now you have some birds that are quiet mature  are quite capable almost as soon as they hatch  In that case  the parent will put on the most conspicuous distraction displays just before the babies hatch  because once the babies are hatched  they can pretty much take care of themselves  And then you have others birds that are helpless when they hatch  In that case  the parent will save its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers
