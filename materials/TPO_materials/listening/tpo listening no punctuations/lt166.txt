Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class

Professor
OK  now um  a sort of paradigmatic art form of the Middle Ages was stained glass art  Stained glass of course is simply glass that has been colored and cut into pieces and re assembled to form a picture or a decorative design  To truly experience the beauty of this decorative glass you should see it with light passing through it  especially sunlight  which is why stained glass is usually used for windows  But of course it has other uses  especially nowadays

Um  anyway the art of making stained glass windows developed in Europe  urn  during the Middle Ages and was closely related to church building  In the early 1100s a church building method was developed that reduced the stress on the walls so more space could be used for window openings allowing for large and quite elaborate window designs

Back then  the artists made their own glass  but first they came up with the design  Paper was scarce and expensive  so typically they drew the design onto a white tabletop  They d draw the principal outline but also outline the shape of each piece of glass to be used and indicate its color

Now in the window itself the pieces of glass would be held together by strips of lead  So in the drawing the artists would also indicate the location of the lead strips  Then you could put a big piece of glass on the tabletop and see the design right through it and use it to guide the cutting of the glass into smaller pieces
Student
And the lead that was just to hold the pieces of glass together

Professor
Well  lead is strong and flexible so it s ideal for joining pieces of glasses cut in different shapes and sizes  But up to the 15th century the lead strips also helped create the design  They were worked into the window as part of the composition  They were used to outline figures to show boundaries just like you might use solid lines in a pencil drawing

Student
How did they get the color   I mean how did they color the glass

Professor
Well up until the 16th century stained glass was colored during the glass making process itself  You got specific colors by adding metallic compounds to the other glass making ingredients
So if you wanted red you added copper  if you wanted green you added iron  You just added these compounds to the other ingredients that the glass was made of

Student
So each piece of glass is just one color

Professor
Yes  at least up until the 16th century  Then they started    um    you started to get painted glass  Painted glass windows are still referred to as stained glass but the colors were actually painted directly onto clear glass after the glass was made  So um     with this kind of stained glass  you could paint a piece of glass with more than one color

Student
And with painted glass they still used the lead strips

Professor
Yes  with really large windows it took more than one piece of glass  so you still needed lead strips to hold the pieces together  But the painters actually tried to hide them  So it was different from before when the lead strips were part of the design  And it is different  because with painted glass the idea of light corning through to create the magical effect wasn t the focus any more  The paintwork was

And painted glass windows became very popular  In the 19th century  people started using them in private houses and public buildings  Unfortunately  many of the original stained glass windows were thought to be old fashioned and they were actually destroyed  replaced by painted glass

Student
They actually broke them  That showed good judgment  real foresight  didn t it

Professor
Yes  if only they had known  Uh  and it s not just that old stained glass is really valuable today  we lost possibly great artwork  But luckily there was a revival of the early techniques in the mid I 800s and artists went back to creating colored glass and using the lead strips in their designs  The effects are much more beautiful

In the 19th century  Louis Tiffany came up with methods to create beautiful effects without having to paint the glass  He layered pieces of glass and used thin copper strips instead of lead  which let him make these really intricate flowery designs for stained glass  which he used in lampshades  You ve heard of Tiffany lampshades  right  These of course took advantage of the new innovation of electric lighting  Electric light bulbs don t give quite the same effect as sunlight streaming through stained glass  but it s close  So layered glass  Tiffany glass  became very popular and still is today

So let s look at some examples of different types of stained glass from each era
