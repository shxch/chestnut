Neoclassical Art 

Neoclassical Art was common from the middle of the 1700s to the early 1800s. It was based on the artistic ideas of ancient Greece and Rome. The Neoclassical style was used for paintings, sculptures, architecture, dramatic performances, and music. It became popular during the 1740s. This was when the ancient Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum were discovered. In the first century A.D., an eruption of the volcano Mt. Vesuvius buried both towns under a layer of ash. When the towns were unearthed, they were mostly intact. This included their paintings, sculptures, and architecture. Images of them rapidly spread across Europe. This led to the creation of Neoclassical Art.

It also arose as a reaction to Rococo and Baroque Art. Both were seen as too elaborate. Neoclassical artists tried to be more "pure" in form. They believed they were expressing the purity of Rome. At that time, people thought the Romans had been heroic, stoic, and self-sacrificing. The Romans had thought that the empire was more important than the individual. Therefore Neoclassical artists tried to paint people and events in heroic ways.

The movement began in England and France. It reached its height from 1790 to 1815. This was the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. One of the greatest artists of the period was Jacque-Louis David. His works always featured heroic subjects. His most famous painting is Napoleon Bonaparte Crossing the Alps. It shows Napoleon seated on a white horse. He also painted many scenes from Greek and Roman history. Those works, such as The Death of Socrates, show the value of self-sacrifice and loyalty. Neoclassical Art lasted through the late 1800s. The more lavish Romanticism became more influential than it though. Romanticism, ironically, began as a reaction against the simple, pure style of Neoclassical Art.
