Lecture2 Geology  Movement of Tectonic Plates
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class

Professor
As we ve discussed  Earth s crust is made up of large plates that rest on a mantle of molten rock  These plates…uh…now these tectonic plates support the continents and oceans  Over time  the tectonic plates move and shift  which moves the continents and the ocean floors too  Once it was understood how these plates move  it was possible to determine past movements of Earth s continents and how these slow movements have reshaped Earth s features at different times
OK  Well   as studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past  it can conceivably tell us about their location in the future too  right  So  in recent years  some geologists have used plate tectonic theory to make what they call geo predictions  Geo predictions are guesses about what Earth s surface might look like millions of years from now
So  we know how certain continents are currently moving  For example  the continents of Africa has been creeping north toward Europe  And Australia has been making its way north too  toward Asia
Does anyone know what s happening to the Americas  I…I think we ve talked about that before  Lisa
Student
They are moving westward  away from Europe and Africa  Right
Professor
Right  And what makes us think that
Student
The Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading and getting wider  so there is more ocean between the Americas and Europe and Africa
Professor
OK  And why is it spreading
Student
Well  the seafloor is spilt  There is a ridge  a mountain range that runs north and south there  And the rock material flows up from Earth s interior here  at the split  which forces the two sides of the ocean floor to spread apart  to make room for the new rock material
Professor
Good  And that means  over the short term…uh… and by short term I mean 50 million years  that s a blink of the eye in geological time  Um…over the short term  we can predict that the Americas will continue to move westward  farther away from Europe  while Africa and Australia will continue to move northward
But what about over the long term  Say 250 million years or more  Well  over that length of time  forecasts become more uncertain  But lots of geologists predict that eventually all the continents  including Antarctica  will merge and become one giant land mass  a super continent  one researchers callingPangaea Ultima  which more or less means the last super continent  The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird
Now  how that might happen is open to some debate  Some geologists believe that the Americas will continue to move westward and eventually merge with East Asia  This hypothesis is based on the direction the Americas are moving in now  But others hypothesize that a new super continent will form in a different way  They think that a new subduction zone will might occur at the western edge of the Atlantic Ocean
Paul  can you remind us what a subduction zone is
Student
Yeah  Um…basically  a subduction zone is where two tectonic plates collide  So if an ocean floor tectonic plate meets the edge of a continent and they push against each other  the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one  So the…um…the oceanic plate is made of denser and heavier rock  so it begins to sink down under the continental plate and into the mantle
Professor
Right  So the ocean floor would kind of slide under the edge of the continent  And once the ocean plate begins to sink  it would be affected by another force – slab pull  Slab pull happens at the subduction zone
So to continue our example… As the ocean floor plate begins to sink down into the mantle  it would drag or pull the entire plate along with it  So more and more of this plate  the ocean floor  would go down under the continent into the mantle  OK
So  as I said  currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading  getting wider  but some researchers speculate that eventually a subduction zone will occur where the oceanic plate meets the continental plate of the Americas  If that happens  slab pull could draw the oceanic crust under the continent  actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the ocean floor to get smaller  That is  the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up  narrowing the distance between the eastern edge of the Americas and Europe and Africa  So they form a single super continent  ?
