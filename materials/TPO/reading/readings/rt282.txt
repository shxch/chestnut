Early Saharan Pastoralists

The Sahara is a highly diverse  albeit dry  region that has undergone major climatic changes since 10 000 B C  As recently as 6 000 B C  the southern frontier of the desert was far to the north of where it is now  while semiarid grassland and shallow freshwater lakes covered much of what are now arid plains  This was a landscape where antelope of all kinds abounded    along with Bos primigenius  a kind of oxen that has become extinct  The areas that are now desert were  like all arid regions  very susceptible to cycles of higher and lower levels of rainfall  resulting in major  sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals  The people who hunted the sparse desert animals responded to drought by managing the wild resources they hunted and gathered  especially wild oxen  which had to have regular water supplies to survive
Even before the drought  the Sahara was never well watered  Both humans and animals were constantly on the move  in search of food and reliable water supplies  Under these circumstances  archaeologist Andrew Smith believes  the small herds of Bos primigenius in the desert became smaller  more closely knit breeding units as the drought took hold  The beasts were more disciplined  so that it was easier for hunters to predict their habits  and capture animals at will  At the same time  both cattle and humans were more confined in their movements  staying much closer to permanent water supplies for long periods of time  As a result  cattle and humans came into close association
Smith believes that the hunters were well aware of the more disciplined ways in which their prey behaved  Instead of following the cattle on their annual migrations  the hunters began to prevent the herd from moving from one spot to another  At first  they controlled the movement of the herd while ensuring continuance of their meat diet  But soon they also gained genetic control of the animals  which led to rapid physical changes in the herd  South African farmers who maintain herds of wild eland  large African antelopes with short  twisted horns  report that the offspring soon diminish in size  unless wild bulls are introduced constantly from outside  The same effects of inbreeding may have occurred in controlled cattle populations  with some additional  and perhaps unrecognized  advantages  The newly domesticated animals behaved better  were easier to control  and may have enjoyed a higher birth rate  which in turn yielded greater milk supplies  We know from rock paintings deep in the Sahara that the herders were soon selecting breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors
It is still unclear whether domesticated cattle were tamed independently in northern Africa or introduced to the continent from southwest Asia  Whatever the source of the original tamed herds might have been  it seems entirely likely that much the same process of juxtaposition  living side by side  and control occurred in both southwest Asia and northern Africa  and even in Europe  among peoples who had an intimate knowledge of the behavior of wild cattle  The experiments with domestication probably occurred in many places  as people living in ever drier environments cast around for more predictable food supplies
The cattle herders had only a few possessions  unsophisticated pots and polished adzes  They also hunted with bow and arrow  The Saharan people left a remarkable record of their lives painted on the walls of caves deep in the desert  Their artistic endeavors have been preserved in paintings of wild animals  cattle  goats  humans  and scenes of daily life that extend back perhaps to 5 000 B C   The widespread distribution of pastoral sites of this period suggests that the Saharans ranged their herds over widely separated summer and winter grazing grounds
About 3 500 B C   climatic conditions again deteriorated  The Sahara slowly became drier and lakes vanished  On the other hand  rainfall increased in the interior of western Africa  and the northern limit of the tsetse fly  an insect fatal to cattle  moved south  So the herders shifted south  following the major river systems into savanna regions  By this time  the Saharan people were probably using domestic crops  experimenting with such summer rainfall crops as sorghum and millet as they move out of areas where they could grow wheat  barley  and other Mediterranean crops

1  According to paragraph 1  what was true of the Sahara region around 6 000 B C
  Much less of it was desert than is now the case
  Most areas that are now grassland were covered by shallow lakes
  It had just undergone a major climatic change
  Wild oxen and antelopes lived in separate parts of the region

2  The word  albeit  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  usually
  almost
  though
  rather

3  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is true of all arid regions
  They include at least some freshwater lakes
  They have similar distributions of plants and animals
  They are greatly affected by changes in the amount of rain they receive
  They have frequent droughts that make it difficult to manage the wild resources


4  Paragraph 2 supports which of the following ideas about wild oxen in the Sahara region after the drought took hold
  They traveled in smaller herds
  They were harder for hunters to capture
  They tended to be significantly smaller in size
  They moved along less predictable routes

5  According to paragraph 2  what was it that brought cattle and humans into close association
  The development of smaller breeding units within herds
  Cattle and humans staying close to permanent water supplies for long period of time
  The development of greater discipline among cattle
  Cattle and humans constantly on the move searching for food and reliable water supplies


6  Why does the author mention the  rock paintings deep in the Sahara
  To help explain why the hunters wanted to control the herds
  To provide support for the idea that the herders soon gained genetic control of the cattle
  To show that the herders had artistic as well as practical abilities
  To argue that the herders soon began to value their cattle for more than food

7  According to paragraph 3  all of the following statements were true of newly domesticated animals EXCEPT
  They were controlled more easily by the farmers
  They produced a larger number of offspring
  They produce more milk
  They were larger in size


8   which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from  people tried to control them by living in juxtaposition with them
  Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from  they resulted from the same process of juxtaposition and control by people who understood the behavior of wild cattle
  People who had an intimate knowledge of the behavior of wild cattle moved closer together to cooperate in taming the herd  regardless of where they found them
  The process of taming herds was certainly the same in southwest Asia  northern Africa  and Europe because people knew a lot about the behavior of wild cattle  regardless of where they lived






9  According to paragraph 5  each of the following was true about the early Saharan people EXCEPT
  They had few possessions apart from cattle
  After about 5 000 B C   they lived primarily in caves that were located deep in the desert
  Between the summer and winter seasons  they moved their herds over long distances
  They painted animals and scenes of daily life on the walls of caves


10  The word  endeavors  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  methods
  styles
  scenes
  efforts






11  The word  deteriorated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  became unstable
  caused hardship
  changed completely
  got worse

12  According to paragraph 6  what allowed the herders to shift south into the savanna regions after about 3 500 B C
  They could easily grow Mediterranean crops in those regions
  They could more easily domesticated sorghum and millet in those regions
  The tsetse fly was no longer a problem in those regions
  The river systems in those regions provided reliable sources of water in the summer

As recently as 6 000 B C   much of the Sahara region was semiarid grassland where humans hunted wild oxen and antelope



Answer Choices

  There was enough freshwater for Saharan peoples to move freely throughout the region without having to manage the resources they hunted and gathered
  Once Saharans controlled the breeding of their cattle  the characteristics of the cattle changed rapidly  increasing their reproductive rate and milk production
  Although the Saharan peoples were remarkably sophisticated artists  they had only a few simple possessions  like adzes and the bows and arrows they used for hunting
  When the drying climate forced cattle and humans close to each other in areas with water supplies  humans gained control over the cattle and eventually domesticated them
  Herders soon began selecting breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors  although the advantage of controlled inbreeding were not apparent to them at first
  As the drought worsened around 3 500 B C  and conditions for herders became more favorable to the south  the Saharan people moved into savanna regions  where they grew different crops
