Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a structural engineering class

Professor
Today let s begin to look at structural engineering in the Space Age  Uh  new problems…new possibilities mean we can think in new ways  find radically different approaches  So let s consider…uh  well  what would you say is the biggest obstacle today to putting structures  equipment  people …uh  anything really  into space

Student
Well  the cost  right

Professor
Exactly  I mean  just taking the space shuttle up and back one time is hugely expensive  Uh  why

Student
I guess a lot of it is for fuel  right  To…to get the rocket going fast enough

Professor
OK  Fast enough to…

Student
To escape Earth s gravity

Professor
Good  So we are burning up an enormous amount of fuel at every launch just to get the rocket up to what s known as escape velocity  Now  escape velocity is around 11 kilometers a second  pretty fast  But do we really have to go this fast

Student
Well  yeah  I mean  how else can you  um…escape  I mean  that s the whole point of escape velocity  right  Otherwise gravity will pull you back down to the Earth

Professor
Actually  that s a common misconception  Escape velocity is simply the speed of an object that s …uh  let s say  shot out of a cannon the minimum initial speed so that the object could later escape Earth s gravity on its own  But that s just if there s no additional force being applied  If you keep on supplying force to the object  keep on pushing it upward  It could pull away from Earth s gravity at any speed

Student
Even really slow  So you re saying …like  if you had a ladder tall enough  you could just climb into space

Professor
Yeah  Uh  well  theoretically  I mean  I can see some practical problems with the ladder example  Uh  like you might get just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so  uh  especially with all the oxygen tanks you ll have to be hauling up with you

No  I was thinking more along the lines of an elevator

Student
Wait  You are serious

Professor
Sure  An elevator  That s a new idea to most of us  but in fact it s been around for over a century  If we could power such an elevator with solar energy  we could simply rise up into space for a fraction of the cost of a trip by rocket or shuttle

Student
But wait  elevators don t just rise up  It have  sic  to hang on some kind of wire or track or something

Professor
Uh  true  And for decades that s exactly what s prevented the idea from being feasible or even just taken seriously  Where do we find the material strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a cable or track  I mean  we are talking 36 000 kilometers here  And the strain on the cable would be more than most materials could bear

But a new material developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond  yet it s much more flexible  I am talking about carbon nanotubes

Student
OK  I ve read something about carbon nanotubes  They are strong  alright  but aren t they just very short little cylinders in shape

Professor
Ah  yes  But these cylinders cling together at a molecular level  You pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes  and its neighbor s come with it  and their neighbors  and so on  So you could actually draw out a 36 000 kilometer strand or ribbon of nanotubes stronger than steel  but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair

Student
OK  Fine  But what s going to hold this ribbon up and keep it reach enough to support an elevator car

Professor
Well  we definitely have to anchor it at both ends  So what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the equator and a satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth  There s a reason I mentioned that figure of 36 000 kilometers  That s about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the equator to constantly remain directly above the exact same spot on the rotating planet Earth  So once you are in this geostationary orbit right over the tower  just lower your carbon nanotube cable down from the satellite  tether it to the tower here on Earth  And there you have it

Student
So you really think this is a possibility  Like  how soon could it happen

Professor
Well  the science fiction writer Arthur C  Clarke talked about building a space elevator back in the 1970s  And when someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality  his reply was   Probably about fifty years after everybody quits laughing
