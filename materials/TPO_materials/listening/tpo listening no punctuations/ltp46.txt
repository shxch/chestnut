Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class

Professor
Um  beginning in the late 1960s  geologists began to uncover some evidence of a rather surprising kind when they looked       um       at various places around the world  What they found out when they examined rocks from about a       the period from about 750 million years ago to about 580 million years ago  they found that       it seemed that glaciers covered the entire surface of the Earth from pole to pole  including the tropics
Um       how did they come to this astonishing conclusion  What was the evidence for this  Especially when glaciers today are found only at the poles       or in the mountains
Well  uh       basically when glaciers grow and move they leave behind a distinctive deposit consisting of primarily       of  at least on the top level  of ground up little bits of rock       almost       they almost look like rocks that have been deposited by streams  if you ve ever seen those  And that s caused because  although the glacier is ice  it is actually flowing very slowly and as it moves it grinds the top layer of rock  it breaks off pieces and carries them away  So when you have glaciation you have a distinctive pattern of these pieces of rock which are called  erratics

Erratics are rocks       they re the stones that are often carried long distances by glaciers
So  in the 1960s and onward up through the 1990s  we keep finding evidence for glaciation  no matter what the latitude       even in tropical latitudes  Now  today there are glaciers in the tropics but only at very high elevations  But 750 million years ago  apparently there were glaciers even at sea level in the tropics
How could this have happened
Well  first       the growth of glaciers  uh  benefits  if you will  from a kind of a positive feedback loop called the  ice albedo effect

With the ice albedo effect  glaciers  cause they re white reflect light and heat more       much more than does liquid water       or soil and rock  which are dark and absorb heat  So  the more glaciers there are  the more heat is reflected  so the climate gets cooler  and glaciers grow even more
However       normally  on a global scale  there is a major process that functions to curb the growth of glaciers  And  that process involves carbon dioxide

Now  we re all familiar with the notion that carbon dioxide is what we call a  green house gas   The more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere  the more heat the atmosphere retains  That s what a greenhouse gas does  So  the greenhouse gas effect is kinda the opposite of the albedo effect
Um       now as it happens       when silicate rocks  which is a very common class of rock  when they re exposed to the air and to normal weathering  they erode  Carbon dioxide is attracted to these eroding rocks and binds to them  forming calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate is eventually washed into the ocean where it settles to the bottom  This process  this forming of calcium carbonate  has the effect of sucking the carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it at the bottom of the ocean

Now  follow me here  The process that s sucking carbon dioxide out of the air  keeping the greenhouse gas levels low  cannot happen if the rock is covered with ice
So  while glaciers reflect light and heat       cooling the Earth  they at the same time cover rocks so there s less calcium carbonate formed       which leaves more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  Higher levels of carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere warm       which slows the growth of glaciers  So  it s a balance  and the glacier growth remains pretty much under control
Now  what happened 750 million years ago to upset that balance  It seems a relatively simple explanation actually
750 million years ago       all the major continents are rocky  bare  and pretty much lined up along the equator  they hadn t yet moved to where they are today  So  what happened was  perhaps a slight cooling of       the very slight and temporary cooling of the Sun which still happens from time to time and the Earth starts to cool  the ice starts to spread on the oceans       starting at the poles
Now  by the time the ice reaches about two thirds of the way to the equator  it s too late
See       because the continents are the last things to be covered by glaciers  they continue weathering       the rocks keep eroding and the carbon dioxide levels keep falling       So  the ice albedo effect from the glaciers is increasing in strength while the atmosphere continues to lose its ability to retain heat making glacier growth unstoppable  Now you have what s called a  runaway freeze   And for perhaps as long as 50 million years  possibly with some interludes  the Earth was frozen from pole to pole  like a giant snowball

Professor
Well  uh       basically when glaciers grow and move they leave behind a distinctive deposit consisting of primarily       of  at least on the top level  of ground up little bits of rock       almost       they almost look like rocks that have been deposited by streams  if you ve ever seen those

Why does the professor say this
Professor
      they almost look like rocks that have been deposited by streams  if you ve ever seen those
