The Silk Road

For centuries, one trade route was more important than all others. It was the Silk Road. It went from China and India to the West. It was both a land and sea route. A great amount of economic activity took place on the Silk Road. It was comprised of many trails, pathways, routes, and seaways. Merchants from Asia often traveled to the Middle East on it. From there, goods were shipped to Europe. The people involved in trade on the Silk Road often became wealthy.

The Silk Road began long before the rise of the Roman Empire. Around the second century B.C., Chinese and Indian traders began leaving their homelands and heading west. They made connections with merchants in Central Asia. These people, in turn, made connections with others in the Middle East. This formed a simple trade route. Around 50 B.C., the Romans connected to the route after they conquered Egypt. Spices, gems, silk, and other goods flowed back and forth along the Silk Road. They were carried by long trains of horses, camels, and donkeys. On some of the routes, such as from India to the Arabian Peninsula, the goods were transported by ships.

The Silk Road was of both cultural and economic importance. The people of Europe and Asia learned much about one another thanks to their trade contacts. This let them exchange both news and knowledge. But it was much more important economically. Trade on the Silk Road brought great wealth to the Middle East. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Italian city-states such as Venice and Genoa also became wealthy. The riches of the Silk Road brought them great power as well. For as long as the Silk Road was used, its economic benefits were enormous.
