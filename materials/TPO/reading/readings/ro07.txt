Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes  marlins  sailfishes  and swordfish  swim continuously  Feeding  courtship  reproduction  and even  rest  are carried out while in constant motion  As a result  practically every aspect of the body form and function of these swimming  machines  is adapted to enhance their ability to swim 
Many of the adaptations of these fishes serve to reduce water resistance  drag   Interestingly enough  several of these hydrodynamic adaptations resemble features designed to improve the aerodynamics of high speed aircraft  Though human engineers are new to the game  tunas and their relatives evolved their  high tech  designs long ago 
Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes have made streamlining into an art form  Their bodies are sleek and compact  The body shapes of tunas  in fact  are nearly ideal from an engineering point of view  Most species lack scales over most of the body  making it smooth and slippery  The eyes lie flush with the body and do not protrude at all  They are also covered with a slick  transparent lid that reduces drag  The fins are stiff  smooth  and narrow  qualities that also help cut drag  When not in use  the fins are tucked into special grooves or depressions so that they lie flush with the body and do not break up its smooth contours  Airplanes retract their landing gear while in flight for the same reason 
Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes have even more sophisticated adaptations than these to improve their hydrodynamics  The long bill of marlins  sailfishes  and swordfish probably helps them slip through the water  Many supersonic aircraft have a similar needle at the nose  
Most tunas and billfishes have a series of keels and finlets near the tail  Although most of their scales have been lost  tunas and mackerels retain a patch of coarse scales near the head called the corselet  The keels  finlets  and corselet help direct the flow of water over the body surface in such a way as to reduce resistance  see the figure   Again  supersonic jets have similar features 
Because they are always swimming  tunas simply have to open their mouths and water is forced in and over their gills  Accordingly  they have lost most of the muscles that other fishes use to suck in water and push it past the gills  In fact  tunas must swim to breathe  They must also keep swimming to keep from sinking  since most have largely or completely lost the swim bladder  the gas filled sac that helps most other fish remain buoyant  
One potential problem is that opening the mouth to breathe detracts from the streamlining of these fishes and tends to slow them down  Some species of tuna have specialized grooves in their tongue  It is thought that these grooves help to channel water through the mouth and out the gill slits  thereby reducing water resistance  
There are adaptations that increase the amount of forward thrust as well as those that reduce drag  Again  these fishes are the envy of engineers  Their high  narrow tails with swept back tips are almost perfectly adapted to provide propulsion with the least possible effort  Perhaps most important of all to these and other fast swimmers is their ability to sense and make use of swirls and eddies  circular currents  in the water  They can glide past eddies that would slow them down and then gain extra thrust by  pushing off  the eddies  Scientists and engineers are beginning to study this ability of fishes in the hope of designing more efficient propulsion systems for ships  
The muscles of these fishes and the mechanism that maintains a warm body temperature are also highly efficient  A bluefin tuna in water of 7째C  45째F  can maintain a core temperature of over 25째C  77째F   This warm body temperature may help not only the muscles to work better  but also the brain and the eyes  The billfishes have gone one step further  They have evolved special  heaters  of modified muscle tissue that warm the eyes and brain  maintaining peak performance of these critical organs
