 
William Smith

In 1769 in a little town in Oxfordshire  England  a child with the very ordinary name of William Smith was born into the poor family of a village blacksmith  He received rudimentary village schooling  but mostly he roamed his uncle s farm collecting the fossils that were so abundant in the rocks of the Cotswold Hills  When he grew older  William Smith taught himself surveying from books he bought with his small savings  and at the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a surveyor of the local parish  He then proceeded to teach himself geology  and when he was twenty four  he went to work for the company that was excavating the Somerset Coal Canal in the south of England

This was before the steam locomotive  and canal building was at its height  The companies building the canals to transport coal needed surveyors to help them find the coal deposits worth mining as well as to determine the best courses for the canals  This job gave Smith an opportunity to study the fresh rock outcrops created by the newly dug canal  He later worked on similar jobs across the length and breadth of England  all the while studying the newly revealed strata and collecting all the fossils he could find  Smith used mail coaches to travel as much as 10 000 miles per year  In 1815 he published the first modern geological map   A Map of the Strata of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland   a map so meticulously researched that it can still be used today

In 1831 when Smith was finally recognized by the Geological Society of London as the  father of English geology   it was not only for his maps but also for something even more important  Ever since people had begun to catalog the strata in particular outcrops  there had been the hope that these could somehow be used to calculate geological time  But as more and more accumulations of strata were cataloged in more and more places  it became clear that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from region to region and that no rock type was ever going to become a reliable time marker throughout the world  Even without the problem of regional differences  rocks present a difficulty as unique time markers  Quartz is quartz a silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions there s no difference at all between two million year old Pleistocene quartz and Cambrian quartz created over 500 million years ago

As he collected fossils from strata throughout England  Smith began to see that the fossils told a different story from the rocks  Particularly in the younger strata  the rocks were often so similar that he had trouble distinguishing the strata  but he never had trouble telling the fossils apart  While rock between two consistent strata might in one place be shale and in another sandstone  the fossils in that shale or sandstone were always the same  Some fossils endured through so many millions of years that they appear in many strata  but others occur only in a few strata  and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum  Fossils are thus identifying markers for particular periods in Earth s history

Not only could Smith identify rock strata by the fossils they contained  he could also see a pattern emerging  certain fossils always appear in more ancient sediments  while others begin to be seen as the strata become more recent  By following the fossils  Smith was able to put all the strata of England s earth into relative temporal sequence  About the same time  Georges Cuvier made the same discovery while studying the rocks around Paris

Soon it was realized that this principle of faunal  animal  succession was valid not only in England or France but virtually everywhere  It was actually a principle of floral succession as well  because plants showed the same transformation through time as did fauna  Limestone may be found in the Cambrian or 300 million years later in the Jurassic strata  but a trilobite the ubiquitous marine arthropod that had its birth in the Cambrian will never be found in Jurassic strata  nor a dinosaur in the Cambrian

1  The word  rudimentary  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 thorough
 strict
 basic
 occasional

2  According to paragraph 1  which of the following statements about William Smith is NOT true
 Smith learned surveying by reading and by apprenticing for a local surveyor
 Smith s family lived in a small English town and possessed little wealth
 Smith learned about fossils from books he borrowed from his uncle
 Smith eventually left his village to work on the excavation of an English canal



3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about canal building
  Canals were built primarily in the south of England rather than in other regions
 Canal building decreased after the steam locomotive was invented
  Canal building made it difficult to study rock strata which often became damaged in the process
  Canal builders hired surveyors like Smith to examine exposed rock strata

4  According to paragraph2  which of the following is true of the map published by William Smith
 It indicates the locations of England s major canals
 It became most valuable when the steam locomotive made rail travel possible
 The data for the map were collected during Smith s work on canals
 It is no longer regarded as a geological masterpiece


5  The word  meticulously  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 carefully
 quickly
 frequently
 obviously

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The discovery of regional differences in the sequences of rocks led geologists to believe that rock types could someday become reliable time markers
 Careful analysis of strata revealed that rocks cannot establish geological time because the pattern of rock layers varies from place to place
 Smith s catalogs of rock strata indicated that the sequences of rocks are different from place to place and from region to region
 Because people did not catalog regional differences in sequences of rocks  it was believed that rocks could never be reliable time markers
7  Why does the author use the phrase  Quartz is quartz
 To describe how the differences between Pleistocene and Cambrian quartz reveal information about dating rocks
 To point out that the chemical composition of quartz makes it more difficult to date than other rocks
 To provide an example of how regional differences in rock sequences can make a particular rock difficult to date
 To explain that rocks are difficult to use for dating because their chemical compositions always remain the same over time


8  According to paragraph 4  it was difficult for Smith to distinguish rock strata because
 the rocks from different strata closely resembled each other
 he was often unable to find fossils in the younger rock strata
 their similarity to each other made it difficult for him to distinguish one rock type from another
 the type of rock between two consistent strata was always the same

9  The word  endured  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 vanished
 developed
 varied
 survived

10  The word  virtually  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 possibly
 absolutely
 surprisingly
 nearly

11  Select the TWO answer choices that are true statements based upon the discussion of the principle of faunal succession in paragraph 5  To receive credit  you must select TWO answers
 It was a principle that applied to fauna but not to flora
 It was discovered independently by two different geologists
 It describes how fossils are distributed in rock strata
 It explains why plants and animals undergo transformations through time

12  In mentioning  trilobite   the author is making which of the following points
 Fossils cannot be found in more than one rock stratum
 Faunal succession can help put rock layers in relative temporal sequence
 Faunal succession cannot be applied to different strata composed of the same kind of rock
 The presence of trilobite fossils makes it difficult to date a rock




13 Look at the four squares  █ that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
The findings of these geologists inspired others to examine the rock and fossil records in different parts of the world．
Where would the sentence best fit
