The Nara Period

The Nara Period in Japan lasted from 710 to 794. For much of this time, the Japanese emperors lived in the city of Nara. It was a golden age for Japan. Many people learned to write then. Poets wrote many great poems, and other writers made outstanding works of literature during the Nara Period. The Chinese were a major influence on Japan then. For instance, the Japanese wrote with Chinese characters. They copied Chinese fashions and architecture. And Buddhism came to Japan from China around that time. 

Yet it was not a perfect era. There was a lot of political intrigue. Many people tried to sway the emperors. This was particularly true of some families. The Fujiwara family was one. A few Fujiwara daughters married emperors. So their children became quite powerful. In fact, the Fujiwara family influenced Japan for more than 300 years after the Nara Period ended.
