The Origins of Cetaceans

It should be obvious that cetaceans whales  porpoises  and dolphins are mammals  They breathe through lungs  not through gills  and give birth to live young  Their streamlined bodies  the absence of hind legs  and the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals  However  unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds  seals  sea lions  and walruses  whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea   it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like  Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record  How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged  Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate  or transitional  between land mammals and cetaceans
Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans  In 1979  a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale  The fossil was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made  Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old  The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea

The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte  an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans  Although limited to a skull  the Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the origins of cetaceans  The skull is cetacean like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales  Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals  The skull also lacks a blowhole  another cetacean adaptation for diving  Other features  however  show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh eating mammals  the mesonychids  and cetaceans  It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean  It probably bred and gave birth on land

Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989  Several skeletons of another early whale  Basilosaurus  were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert  This whale lived around 40 million years ago  12 million years after Pakicetus  Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included  for the first time in an archaeocyte  a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes  Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50 foot long Basilosaurus on land  Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional  or vestigial  hind legs

An even more exciting find was reported in 1994  also from Pakistan  The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans   the walking whale that swam   lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago  It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus  The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs  The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped  The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea  The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke  the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans  The structure of the backbone shows  however  that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down  even though a fluke was missing  The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water  On land  where it probably bred and gave birth  Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion  It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea


1  Fluke  the two parts that constitute the large triangular tail of a whale
2  Blowhole  a hole in the top of the head used for breathing


1  In paragraph 1  what does the author say about the presence of a blowhole in cetaceans
 It clearly indicates that cetaceans are mammals
 It cannot conceal the fact that cetaceans are mammals
 It is the main difference between cetaceans and land dwelling mammals
 It cannot yield clues about the origins of cetaceans
2  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about early sea otters
 It is not difficult to imagine what they looked like
 There were great numbers of them
 They lived in the sea only
 They did not leave many fossil remains


3  The word  precious  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 exact
 scarce
 valuable
 initial
4  Pakicetus and modern cetaceans have similar
 hearing structures
 adaptations for diving
 skull shapes
 breeding locations
5  The word  It  in the passage refers to
 Pakicetus
 fish
 life
 ocean









6  The word  exposed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 explained
 visible
 identified
 located


7  The hind leg of Basilosaurus was a significant find because it showed that Basilosaurus
 lived later than Ambulocetus natans
 lived at the same time as Pakicetus
 was able to swim well
 could not have walked on land


8  It can be inferred that Basilosaurus bred and gave birth in which of the following locations
 On land
 Both on land and at sea
 In shallow water
 In a marine environment























9  Why does the author use the word  luckily  in mentioning that the Ambulocetus natans fossil included hind legs
 Fossil legs of early whales are a rare find
 The legs provided important information about the evolution of cetaceans
 The discovery allowed scientists to reconstruct a complete skeleton of the whale
 Until that time  only the front legs of early whales had been discovered

10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Even though Ambulocetus swam by moving its body up and down  it did not have a backbone
 The backbone of Ambulocetus  which allowed it to swim  provides evidence of its missing fluke
 Although Ambulocetus had no fluke  its backbone structure shows that it swam like modern whales
 By moving the rear parts of their bodies up and down  modern whales swim in a different way from the way Ambulocetus swam
   11  The word  propulsion  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 staying afloat
 changing direction
 decreasing weight
 moving forward
















12  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence can be added to the passage
This is a question that has puzzled scientists for ages
Where would the sentence best fit


13   Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

This passage discusses fossils that help to explain the likely origins of cetaceans whales  porpoises  and dolphins




Answer Choices


 Recent discoveries of fossils have helped to show the link between land mammals and cetaceans
 The discovery of Ambulocetusnatans provided evidence for a whale that lived both on land and at sea
 The skeleton of Basilosaurus was found in what had been the Tethys Sea  an area rich in fossil evidence
 Pakicetus is the oldest fossil whale yet to be found
 Fossils thought to be transitional forms between walking mammals and swimming whales were found
 Ambulocetus  hind legs were used for propulsion in the water
