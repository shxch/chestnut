TPO 8 Lecture 1 Animal Behavior
Pro  OK  Well  last time we talked about passive habitat selection  like plants for example  they don t make active choices about where to grow  They are dispersed by some other agent  like the wind  And if the seeds land in a suitable habitat  they do well and reproduce

With active habitat selection  an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed  And because an animal s breeding habitat is so important  we d expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats  places where their offspring have the best chance of survival  So let s look at the effect this preference can have by looking at some examples

But first let s recap  What do we mean by habitat  Frank

Stu  Well  it s basically the place or environment where an organism normally lives and grows

Pro  Right  and as we v discussed  there are some key elements that a habitat must contain  food obviously  water  it s got to have the right climate and spaces for physical protection  And we saw how important habitat selection is when we look at habitats where some of these factors are removed  perhaps through habitat destruction  I just read about a shorebird  the plover

The plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small shellfish  insects and plants  It blends in with the sand  so it s well camouflaged from predator birds above  But it lays its eggs in shallow depressions in the sand with very little protection around them  So if there are people or dogs on the beach  the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really vulnerable  Out in California where there has been a lot of human development by the ocean  The plovers are now a threatened species  So conservationists tried to recreate a new habitat for them  They made artificial beaches and sand bars in areas inaccessible to people and dogs  And the plover population is up quite a bit in those places

Ok  That is an instance where a habitat is made less suitable  But now  what about cases where an animal exhibits a clear choice between two suitable habitats  In cases like that  does the preference matter  Well  Let s look at the blue warbler

The Blue warbler is a songbird that lives in North America  They clearly prefer hard wood forests with dense shrubs  bushes underneath the trees  They actually nest in the shrubs  not the trees  So they re pretty close to the ground  but these warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density  It is usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older  more dominant birds

And the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success  Because the older  more experienced birds who nest in the high density shrub areas have significantly more offspring than those in low density areas  which suggests that the choice of where to nest does have an impact on the number of chicks they have

But a preferred environment doesn t always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success  For example  In Europe  studies have been done of blackcap warblers  We just call them blackcaps

The Blackcap can be found in two different environments  Their preferred habitat is forests near the edge of streams  However  blackcaps also live in pine woods away from water  Studies have been done on the reproductive success rates for the birds in both areas  and the result showed surprisingly that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both areas    the preferred and the second choice habitat  Well  Why

It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the stream edge habitat compared to the area away from the stream  So this stream edge area had a much denser population  which meant more members of the same species competing for resources  wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same places  which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it s their preferred habitat  So the results of the study suggest that when the number of the competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain point  the second rank habitat becomes just as successful as the prime habitat  just because there are fewer members of the same species living there  So it looks like competition for resources is another important factor in determining if a particular habitat is suitable
