Early Childhood Education

Preschools  educational programs for children under the age of five  differ significantly from one country to another according to the views that different societies hold regarding the purpose of early childhood education  For instance  in a cross country comparison of preschools in China  Japan  and the United States  researchers found that parents in the three countries view the purpose of preschools very differently  Whereas parents in China tend to see preschools primarily as a way of giving children a good start academically  Japanese parents view them primarily as a way of giving children the opportunity to be members of a group  In the United States  in comparison  parents regard the primary purpose of preschools as making children more independent and self reliant  although obtaining a good academic start and having group experience are also important
While many programs designed for preschoolers focus primarily on social and emotional factors  some are geared mainly toward promoting cognitive gains and preparing preschoolers for the formal instruction they will experience when they start kindergarten  In the United States  the best known program designed to promote future academic success is Head Start  Established in the 1960s when the United States declared the War on Poverty  the program has served over 13 million children and their families  The program  which stresses parental involvement  was designed to serve the  whole child   including children s physical health  self confidence  social responsibility  and social and emotional development
Whether Head Start is seen as successful or not depends on the lens through which one is looking  If  for instance  the program is expected to provide long term increases in IQ  intelligence quotient  scores  it is a disappointment  Although graduates of Head Start programs tend to show immediate IQ gains  these increases do not last  On the other hand  it is clear that Head Start is meeting its goal of getting preschoolers ready for school  Preschoolers who participate in Head Start are better prepared for future schooling than those who do not  Furthermore  graduates of Head Start programs have better future school grade  Finally  some research suggests that ultimately Head Start graduates show higher academic performance at the end of high school  although the gains are modest
In addition  results from other types of preschool readiness programs indicate that those who participate and graduate are less like to repeat grades  and they are more like to complete school than readiness program  for every dollar spent on the program  taxpayers saved seven dollars by the time the graduates reached the age of 27
The most recent comprehensive evaluation of early intervention programs suggests that  taken as a group  preschool programs can provide significant benefits  and that government funds invested early in life may ultimately lead to a reduction in future costs  For instance  compared with children who did not participate in early intervention programs  participants in various programs showed gains in emotional or cognitive development  better educational outcomes  increased economic self sufficiency  reduced levels of criminal activity  and improved health related behaviors  Of course  not every program produced all these benefits  and not every child benefited to the same extent  Furthermore  some researchers argue that less expensive programs are just as good as relatively expensive ones  such as Head Start  Still  the results of the evaluation were promising  suggesting that the potential benefits of early intervention can be substantial
Not everyone agrees that programs that seek to enhance academic skills during the preschool years are a good thing  In fact  according to developmental psychologist David Elkind  United States society tends to push children so rapidly that they begin to feel stress and pressure at a young age  Elkind argues that academic success is largely dependent upon factors out of parents  control  such as inherited abilities and a child s rate of maturation  Consequently  children of a particular age cannot be expected to master educational material without taking into account their current level of cognitive development  In short  children require development appropriate educational practice  which is education that is based on both typical development and the unique characteristics of a given child



1  According to paragraph 1  parents in Japan tend to think of preschool primarily as a place where children can
 get a good academic start
 expand their emotional development
 become more independent
 experience being part of a group

2  The word  Whereas  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Although
 Because
 Moreover
 Already

3  The word  focus  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 consider
 respect
 concentrate
 advise

4  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the Head Start program was designed to serve children who
 come from families that do not have a lot of money
 are not doing very well in kindergarten
 were born in the 1950s
 need programs that focus primarily on social and emotional factors



5  According to paragraph 3  the Head Start program had NOT been successful at which of the following
 Helping children adjust to school
  Providing long term increase in IQ scores
 Improving school performance throughout high school
 Preventing children from being placed in special education classes



6  in paragraph 4  the author mentions the  results from other types of readiness programs  to
 provide support for the idea that preschool readiness programs have been somewhat successful
 question the idea that Head Start is more effective than other preschool readiness programs
 indicate school completion is usually the most reliable indicator of success in most reading programs
 emphasize that participation in readiness programs can be increased if costs are reduced



7  According to paragraph 4  a cost benefit analysis of one preschool readiness program revealed that
 only one dollar s worth of benefit was gained for every seven dollars spent on the program
 the benefits of the program lasted only until the participants reached age 27
 taxpayers saved seven dollars for every dollar spent on the program
 to be successful  the program would need to receive about seven times as much money as it currently receives







8  The word  comprehensive  in the passage is closest in meaning to

 Some children benefit more than others do from these programs






11  The word  seek  in the passage is closest in meaning to
