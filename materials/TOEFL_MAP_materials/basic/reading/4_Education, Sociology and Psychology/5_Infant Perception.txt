Infant Perception

The age that babies begin to understand the world is hard to determine. Babies themselves cannot provide the answer. So experts look for signs that babies are perceiving the world around them. These include babies' responses to outside factors. Babies often perceive things through sight, hearing, and speech. They respond in many ways.

Not all babies perceive the world around them at the same age. But they share some similarities. For instance, newborn babies cannot see far. They have trouble focusing. Yet they respond to lights. Most newborn babies appear more interested in black and white items than colored ones. Studies show that young infants see large areas better than small objects. A few months after being born, their vision improves. They can follow a moving object with their eyes. They can shift their eyes from one object to another. They can lock onto people's faces. They can even recognize specific people and things.

Babies can also perceive and respond to sounds. From birth, most of them have excellent hearing. Babies typically respond to sounds by moving their eyes to the source of the sound or by turning their heads. By the age of one, they can recognize when someone calls their name. They are also aware of music at a young age. Some may even move to the sound of music.

As for speaking, babies are incapable of speech right after they are born. While they make sounds, they are nonsensical and are not attempts to make speech. However, by around six months of age, most babies are attempting to communicate. They are starting to make meaningful sounds with their mouths. This is the first stage toward being able to speak. By around ten or eleven months after birth, most babies have spoken their first words.
