Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class

Professor
OK  I wanna go over the different types of meteorites  and what we ve learned from them about the formation of Earth  and the solar system  Uh… the thing is what s especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from interplanetary space  but they consist of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on Earth  just in different proportions  But that makes it easier to identify something as a meteorite  as opposed to…to just a terrestrial rock

So to talk about where meteorites come from  we need to talk about comets and asteroids  which basically   they re basically made up of debris left over from the origin of the solar system 4 6 billion years ago

Now I m going a bit out of a order here…um…I m not going to go into any depth on comets and asteroids now  but we ll come back later and do that  For now  I ll just cover some basic info about them

OK  comets and asteroids  It might help if you think of   remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our solar system  And how they differ in composition  The terrestrial planets  like Mars and Earth  composed largely of rocks and metals  and the large gas giants  like Jupiter  Well  the solar system also has two analogous classes of objects  smaller than planets  namely  asteroids and comets

Relatively near the sun  in the inner solar system  between Jupiter and Mars to be precise  we ve got the asteroid belt  which contains about 90 percents of all asteroids orbiting the sun  These asteroids are…uh…like the terrestrial planets  in that they re composed mostly of rocky material and metals

Far from the sun  in the outer solar system  beyond Jupiter s orbit  temperatures are low enough to permit ices to form out of water and…and out of gases like methane and carbon dioxide  Loose collections of these ices and small rocky particles form into comets  So comets are similar in composition to the gas giants

Both comets and asteroids are   typically are smaller than planets  An even smaller type of interplanetary debris is the meteoroid  And it s from meteoroids that we get meteors and meteorites   Roids  are  for the most part anyway  they are just smaller bits of asteroids and comets  When these bits enter Earth s atmosphere  well  that makes them so special that they get a special name  They re called meteors  Most of them are very small  and they burn up soon after entering Earth s atmosphere  The larger ones that make it through the atmosphere and hit the ground are called meteorites  So meteorites are the ones that actually make it through

Now we ve been finding meteorites on Earth for thousands of years  and we ve analyzed enough of them to learn a lot about their composition  most come from asteroids  though a few may have come from comets  So essentially they are rocks  and like rocks  they re mixtures of minerals  They are generally classified into three broad categories  stones  stony irons and irons

Stone meteorites  which we refer to simply as  uh  stones  are almost entirely rock material  They actually account for almost all of the meteorite material that falls to earth  But even so  it s rare to ever find one  I mean  it s easier to find an iron meteorite or a stony iron  Anyone guess why  Look at their names  What do you think iron meteorites consist of

Student
Mostly iron

Professor
Yeah… iron and some nickel  both of which are metals  And  if you re trying to find metal

Student
Oh  Metal detectors

Professor
Right  thank you  At least that s part of it  Stone meteorites  if they lie around exposed to the weather for a few years  well  they re made of rock  so they end up looking almost indistinguishable from common terrestrial rocks  ones that originated on earth  So it s hard to spot them by eye  But we can use metal detectors to help us find the others  and they re easier to spot by eye  So most of the meteorites in collections  uh  in museums  they ll be   they re iron meteorites  or the stony iron kind  even though they only make up about 5 percent of the meteorite material on the ground
