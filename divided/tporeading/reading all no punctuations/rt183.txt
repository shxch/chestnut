Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an electrical discharge from a storm cloud  The electrical discharge takes place when the attractive tension between a region of negatively charged particles and a region of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly rush together  The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical tension and releases a tremendous amount of energy  which we see as lightning  The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the development of the storm cloud
The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich like structure  Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud  but the middle region becomes negatively charged  Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms  What happens is that small  millimeter to centimeter size  pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud  When these ice pellets fall  some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud  The temperature at the center of the cloud is about  15℃or lower  At such temperatures  the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged  Then updraft wind currents carry the light  positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud  The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center  This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged  while the center becomes negatively charged  The negatively charged region is large  several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter  Below this large  cold  negatively charged region  the cloud is warmer than  15℃  and at these temperatures  collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud
Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses  However  as the storm cloud develops  the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground  Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive  so even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning  it has received a lot of scientific attention
Using high speed photography  scientists have determined that there are two steps to the occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground  First  a channel  or path  is formed that connects the cloud and the ground  Then a strong current of electrons follows that path from the cloud to the ground  and it is that current that illuminates the channel as the lightning we see
The formation of the channel is initiated when electrons surge from the cloud base toward the ground  When a stream of these negatively charged electrons comes within 100 meters of the ground it is met by a stream of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground  When the negatively and positively charged streams meet  a complete channel connecting the cloud and the ground is formed  The channel is only a few centimeters in diameter  but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the channel to the ground in the visible form of a flash of lightning  The stream of positive particles that meets the surge of electrons from the cloud often arises from a tall pointed structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower  That is why the subsequent lightning that follows the completed channel often strikes a tall structure
Once a channel has been formed  it is usually used by several lightning discharges  each of them consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud meeting a stream of positive particles along the established path  Sometimes  however  a stream of electrons following an established channel is met by a positive stream making a new path up from the ground  The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places











1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following take place in the development of a flash of lightening EXCEPT

 great tension between two oppositely charged regions
  an increase in negatively charged particles over positively charged particles
 oppositely charged particles coming together
 the release of electrical energy in the form of visible light



 2  The word  tremendous  in the passage is closest in meaning to

 distinct
 growing
 huge
 immediate











3  According to paragraph2  what causes ice crystal to become positively charged
 Collisions with ice pellets
 Collisions with negatively charged ice crystals at the base of the cloud
 Becoming concentrated in the central region of the cloud
 Forming at a temperature greater than  15℃

4  The word  acquire  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 	reject
 	obtain
 need
 produce

 5  According to paragraph2  why are positively charged ice pellets produced in the lower part of the cloud
 Collisions between ice crystals and ice pellets increase in number in the lower part of the cloud
 	The lower part of the cloud is smaller than the region above it
 	More ice pellets than ice crystals reach the lower part of the cloud
 Temperature in the lower part of the cloud are warmer than  15℃

 6  According to paragraph2  the middle region of a cloud becomes negatively charged due to all of the following EXCEPT
  a shift of electrical charged between ice pellets and ice crystals
 negatively charged ice pellets that remain in the middle
 a temperature of  15℃or less
 the development of a positive charge at the base of the cloud

 7  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that part of the reason that the top of a storm cloud becomes positively charged is that
 the top of the cloud is warmer than the middle of the cloud
  the middle of the cloud is already occupied by positively charged particles
  the negatively charged ice pellets are too heavy to be carried by the updrafts that move ice crystals
 collisions between ice pellets in the top of the cloud produce mainly positively charged particles
8  The author remarks that  Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive  in order to explain why
 this form of lightning has been investigated so much
  this form of lightning is not as common as lightning within a cloud
  scientific understanding of this form of lightning is important
  the buildup of positive charge on the ground beneath a storm cloud can have serious consequences
9  The word  illuminates  in the passage is closet in meaning to
 opens
 completes
 lights
 electrifies
10  According to paragraph5  which of the following is true of the stream of charged particles from the ground
 It prevents streams of electrons from the cloud from striking the ground
 It completes a channel that connects the storm cloud with the ground
 It produces a stream of electrons from the cloud
 It widens the path made by the initial stream of electrons from the cloud
11  Which of the following claims about lightning strikes can be inferred from paragraph 5
 During a lightning strike the diameter of the channel the electrons follow is considerably enlarged beyond a few centimeters
 A building is unlikely to be hit by lightning unless it is at least 100 meters tall
 A building is hit by a lightning strike because the building itself has first determined the path the lightening then takes to it
 The light of a lightning strike first appears at the point where the streams of negative and positive particles meet

12  The word  initiated  is closet in meaning to
 started
 intensified
 finished
 expected
13 Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
The descending stream of electrons divides at the point where the new positive stream channel intersects the established path
Where would the sentence best fit

Lightning takes place when a separation of a positive and negative electrical particles that develops in a storm could suddenly collapses






 A storm cloud first develops a positively charged layer at the top  then a negatively charged middle layer  and finally  a positively charged layer at the bottom
 A separation of oppositely charged particles in clouds develops from collisions of falling ice pellets with ice crystals  from updrafts  and from temperature variations
 Lightning from cloud to ground follows a channel that forms when a stream of electrons moving down meets a stream of positive particles coming up from the ground
 Field studies  laboratory simulations  and high speed photography have all been used to investigate the way charge separations develop in clouds
 Lightning from a cloud to the ground is more likely to be destructive than is lightning that takes place within a cloud
 Once a channel has been formed  it is usually used by several successive electrical discharges that illuminate  the channel as flashes of lightning
