Industrialization in the Netherlands and Scandinavia

While some European countries  such as England and Germany  began to industrialize in the eighteenth century  the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries of Denmark  Norway  and Sweden developed later  All four of these countries lagged considerably behind in the early nineteenth century  However  they industrialized rapidly in the second half of the century  especially in the last two or three decades  In view of their later start and their lack of coal undoubtedly the main reason they were not among the early industrializers it is important to understand the sources of their success

All had small populations  At the beginning of the nineteenth century  Denmark and Norway had fewer than 1 million people  while Sweden and the Netherlands had fewer than 2 5 million inhabitants  All exhibited moderate growth rates in the course of the century  Denmark the highest and Sweden the lowest   but all more than doubled in population by 1900  Density varied greatly  The Netherlands had one of the highest population densities in Europe  whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest Denmark was in between but closer to the Netherlands

Considering human capital as a characteristic of the population  however  all four countries were advantaged by the large percentages of their populations who could read and write  In both 1850 and 1914  the Scandinavian countries had the highest literacy rates in Europe  or in the world  and the Netherlands was well above the European average  This fact was of enormous value in helping the national economies find their niches in the evolving currents of the international economy

Location was an important factor for all four countries  All had immediate access to the sea  and this had important implications for a significant international resource  fish  as well as for cheap transport  merchant marines  and the shipbuilding industry  Each took advantage of these opportunities in its own way  The people of the Netherlands  with a long tradition of fisheries and mercantile shipping  had difficulty in developing good harbors suitable for steamships  eventually they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam  with exceptional results for transit trade with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of overseas foodstuffs and raw materials  sugar  tobacco  chocolate  grain  and eventually oil   Denmark also had an admirable commercial history  particularly with respect to traffic through the Sound  the strait separating Denmark and Sweden   In 1857  in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other commercial nations  Denmark abolished the Sound toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the Sound  This  along with other policy shifts toward free trade  resulted in a significant increase in traffic through the Sound and in the port of Copenhagen

The political institutions of the four countries posed no significant barriers to industrialization or economic growth  The nineteenth century passed relatively peacefully for these countries  with progressive democratization taking place in all of them  They were reasonably well governed  without notable corruption or grandiose state projects  although in all of them the government gave some aid to railways  and in Sweden the state built the main lines  As small countries dependent on foreign markets  they followed a liberal trade policy in the main  though a protectionist movement   developed in Sweden  In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms took place gradually from the late eighteenth century through the first half of the nineteenth  resulting in a new class of peasant landowners with a definite market orientation

The key factor in the success of these countries  along with high literacy  which contributed to it  was their ability to adapt to the international division of labor determined by the early industrializers and to stake out areas of specialization in international markets for which they were especially well suited  This meant a great dependence on international commerce  which had notorious fluctuations  but it also meant high returns to those factors of production that were fortunate enough to be well placed in times of prosperity  In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870  and in 1913  22 percent of a much larger national income  In the early twentieth century  Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production  butter  pork products  and eggs  It exported 80 percent of its butter  almost all to Great Britain  where it accounted for 40 percent of British butter imports

10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The early industrializes controlled most of the international economy  leaving these countries to stake out new areas of specialization along the margins
 Aided by their high literacy rates these countries were able to claim key areas of specialization within established international markets
 High literacy rates enabled these countries to take over international markets and adapt the international division of labor to suit their strengths
 The international division of labor established by the early industrializers was suited to these countries  a key factor in their success


11  According to paragraph 6  a major problem with depending heavily on international markets was that they
 lacked stability
 were not well suited to agricultural products
 were largely controlled by the early industrializers

Although the Netherlands and Scandinavia began to industrialize relatively late  they did so very successfully




 Although these countries all started with small  uneducated populations  industrialization led to significant population growth and higher literacy rates
 Thanks to their ready access to the sea  these countries enjoyed advantages in mercantile shipping  fishing  and shipbuilding
 	Because they all started with good harbors for steamships  these countries started with an important advantage in the competition for transit trade
 	These countries were helped by the fact that their governments were relatively stable and honest and generally  supported liberal trade policies
 These countries were successful primarily because their high literacy rates helped them fill specialized market niches
 Because they were never fully dependent on international commerce  these countries were able to survive notorious fluctuations in international markets
