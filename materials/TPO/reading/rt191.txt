The Roman Army s Impact on Britain


In the wake of the Roman Empire s conquest of Britain in the first century A D   a large number of troops stayed in the new province  and these troops had a considerable impact on Britain with their camps  fortifications  and participation in the local economy  Assessing the impact of the army on the civilian population starts from the realization that the soldiers were always unevenly distributed across the country  Areas rapidly incorporated into the empire were not long affected by the military  Where the army remained stationed  its presence was much more influential  The imposition of a military base involved the requisition of native lands for both the fort and the territory needed to feed and exercise the soldiers  animals  The imposition of military rule also robbed local leaders of opportunities to participate in local government  so social development was stunted and the seeds of disaffection sown  This then meant that the military had to remain to suppress rebellion and organize government


Economic exchange was clearly very important as the Roman army brought with it very substantial spending power  Locally a fort had two kinds of impact  Its large population needed food and other supplies  Some of these were certainly brought from long distances  but demands were inevitably placed on the local area  Although goods could be requisitioned  they were usually paid for  and this probably stimulated changes in the local economy  When not campaigning  soldiers needed to be occupied  otherwise they represented a potentially dangerous source of friction and disloyalty  Hence a writing tablet dated 25 April tells of 343 men at one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking  building a bathhouse  operating kilns  digging clay  and working lead  Such activities had a major effect on the local area  in particular with the construction of infrastructure such as roads  which improved access to remote areas


Each soldier received his pay  but in regions without a developed economy there was initially little on which it could be spent  The pool of excess cash rapidly stimulated a thriving economy outside fort gates  Some of the demand for the services and goods was no doubt fulfilled by people drawn from far afield  but some local people certainly became entwined in this new economy  There was informal marriage with soldiers  who until AD 197 were not legally entitled to wed  and whole new communities grew up near the forts  These settlements acted like small towns  becoming centers for the artisan and trading populations





The army also provided a mean of personal advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from the native peoples  as a man obtained hereditary Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an auxiliary regiment  Such units recruited on an ad hoc  as needed  basis from the area in which they were stationed  and there was evidently large scale recruitment within Britain  The total numbers were at least 12 500 men up to the reign of the emperor Hadrian  A D  117 138   with a peak around A D  80  Although a small proportion of the total population  this perhaps had a massive local impact when a large proportion of the young men were removed from an area  Newly raised regiments were normally transferred to another province from whence it was unlikely that individual recruits would ever return  Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European continent  although one is recorded in Morocco  The reverse process brought young men to Britain  where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of service  and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman character of the frontier population  By the later Roman period    frontier garrisons  groups of soldiers  were only rarely transferred  service in units became effectively hereditary  and forts were no longer populated or maintained at full strength

This process of settling in as a community over several generations  combined with local recruitment  presumably accounts for the apparent stability of the British northern frontier in the later Roman period  It also explains why some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any formal authority in Britain  at the beginning of the fifth century A D  The circumstances that had allowed natives to become Romanized also led the self sustaining military community of the frontier area to become effectively British
