Groundwater
Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground  filling all the available spaces  By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water  this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle  Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface  from precipitation  rain and snow  and from lakes and streams  There it remains  sometimes for long periods  before emerging at the surface again  At first thought it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the  solid  ground underfoot to hold all this water
The necessary space is there  however  in many forms  The commonest spaces are those among the particles sand grains and tiny pebbles of loose  unconsolidated sand and gravel  Beds of this material  out of sight beneath the soil  are common  They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed  For example  as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away  huge volumes of water flowed from them  The water was always laden with pebbles  gravel  and sand  known as glacial outwash  that was deposited as the flow slowed down
The same thing happens to this day  though on a smaller scale  wherever a sediment laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land  dropping its load as the current slows  the water usually spreads out fanwise  depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth  fan shaped slope  Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea  the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first  but will be located inland at some future date  when the sea level falls or the land rises  such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick
In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil  if they are now below the water s upper surface  the water table   the gravels and sands of the former riverbed  and its sandbars  will be saturated with groundwater
So much for unconsolidated sediments  Consolidated  or cemented  sediments  too  contain millions of minute water holding pores  This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally plugged with cementing chemicals  also  parts of the original grains may become dissolved by percolating groundwater  either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards  The result is that sandstone  for example  can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed
Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment  loose or cemented  consists of empty space  Most crystalline rocks are much more solid  a common exception is basalt  a form of solidified volcanic lava  which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous
The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity  But note that porosity is not the same as permeability  which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material  this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking them
Much of the water in a sample of water saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place  But some will remain  clinging to all solid surfaces  It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface  leaving it totally dry  The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can  and water that cannot  drain away
The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another  even though their porosities may be the same  What happens depends on pore size  If the pores are large  the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to hold  and it will drain away  but if the pores are small enough  the water in them will exist as thin films  too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place  then the water will be firmly held



1  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about the ground that we walk on
 It cannot hold rainwater for long periods of time
 It prevents most groundwater from circulating
 It has the capacity to store large amounts of water
 It absorbs most of the water it contains from rivers

2  The word  incredible  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 confusing
 comforting
 unbelievable
 interesting



3  The word  out of sight  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 far away
 hidden
 partly visible
 discovered

4  According to paragraph 2  where is groundwater usually found
 Inside pieces of sand and gravel
 On top of beds of rock
 In fast rivers that are flowing beneath the soil
 In spaces between pieces of sediment

5  The phrase  glacial outwash  in the passage refers to
 fast rivers
 glaciers
 the huge volumes of water created by glacial melting
 the particles carried in water from melting glaciers




6  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as places that sediment laden rivers can deposit their sediments EXCEPT
 A mountain valley
 Flat land
 A lake floor
 The seafloor



7  The word  overlie  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 cover
 change
 separate
 	surround



8  The phrase  So much for  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 that is enough about
 now let us turn to
 of greater concern are
 this is related to

9  The word  plugged  in the passage is closet in meaning to washed
 dragged
 filled up
 soaked through




10  According to paragraphs 6 and 7  why is basalt unlike most crystalline forms of rock
 It is unusually solid
 It often has high porosity
 It has a low proportion of empty space
 It is highly permeable

11  What is the main purpose of paragraph 7
 To explain why water can flow through rock
 To emphasize the large amount of empty space in all rock
 To point out that a rock cannot be both porous and permeable
 To distinguish between two related properties of rock


12  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Surface tension is not strong enough to retain drops of water in rocks with large pores but it strong enough to hold on to thin films of water in rocks with small pores
 Water in rocks is held in place by large pores and drains away from small size pores through surface tension
 Small pores and large pores both interact with surface tension to determine whether a rock will hold water as heavy drops or as a thin film
 If the force of surface tension is too weak to hold water in place as heavy drops  the water will continue to be held firmly in place as a thin film when large pores exist



13  Look at the four squares  â–ˆ  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
What  then  determines what proportion of the water stays and what proportion drains away
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Much of the ground is actually saturated with water





Answer choices

 Sediments that hold water were spread by glaciers and are still spread by rivers and streams
 Water is stored underground in beds of loose sand and gravel or in cemented sediment
 The size of a saturated rock s pores determines how much water it will retain when the rock is put in a dry place
 Groundwater often remains underground for a long time before it emerges again
 Like sandstone  basalt is a crystalline rock that is very porous
 Beds of unconsolidated sediments are typically located at inland sites that were once underwater
