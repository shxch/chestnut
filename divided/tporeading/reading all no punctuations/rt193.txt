Discovering the Ice Ages
In the middle of the nineteenth century  Louis Agassiz  one of the first scientists to study glaciers  immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and became a professor at Harvard University  where he continued his studies in geology and other sciences  For his research  Agassiz visited many places in the northern parts of Europe and North America  from the mountains of Scandinavia and New England to the rolling hills of the American Midwest  In all these diverse regions  Agassiz saw signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation  In flat plains country  he saw moraines  accumulations of earth and loose rock that form at the edges of glaciers  that reminded him of the terminal moraines found at the end of valley glaciers in the Alps  The heterogeneous material of the drift  sand  clay  and rocks deposited there  convinced him of its glacial origin
The areas covered by this material were so vast that the ice that deposited it must have been a continental glacier larger than Greenland or Antarctica  Eventually  Agassiz and others convinced geologists and the general public that a great continental glaciation had extended the polar ice caps far into regions that now enjoy temperate climates  For the first time  people began to talk about ice ages  It was also apparent that the glaciation occurred in the relatively recent past because the drift was soft  like freshly deposited sediment  We now know the age of the glaciation accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon 14 in logs buried in the drift  The drift of the last glaciation was deposited during one of the most recent epochs of geologic time  the Pleistocene  which lasted from 1 8 million to 10 000 years ago  Along the east coast of the United States  the southernmost advance of this ice is recorded by the enormous sand and drift deposits of the terminal moraines that form Long Island and Cape Cod
It soon became clear that there were multiple glacial ages during the Pleistocene  with warmer interglacial intervals between them  As geologists mapped glacial deposits in the late nineteenth century  they became aware that there were several layers of drift  the lower ones corresponding to earlier ice ages  Between the older layers of glacial material were well developed soils containing fossils of warm climate plants  These soils were evidence that the glaciers retreated as the climate warmed  By the early part of the twentieth century  scientists believed that four distinct glaciations had affected North America and Europe during the Pleistocene epoch
This idea was modified in the late twentieth century  when geologists and oceanographers examining oceanic sediment found fossil evidence of warming and cooling of the oceans  Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic record of the Pleistocene than continental glacial deposits did  The fossils buried in Pleistocene and earlier ocean sediments were of foraminifera small  single celled marine organisms that secrete shells of calcium carbonate  or calcite  These shells differ in their proportion of ordinary oxygen  oxygen 16  and the heavy oxygen isotope  oxygen 18   The ratio of oxygen 16 to oxygen 18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer s shell depends on the temperature of the water in which the organism lived  Different ratios in the shells preserved in various layers of sediment reveal the temperature changes in the oceans during the Pleistocene epoch

Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect  They could trace the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers  even in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in temperature around the equator  for example  The oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice  During glaciations  the lighter oxygen 16 has a greater tendency to evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen 18 does  Thus  more of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms  From this analysis of marine   sediments  geologists have learned that there were many shorter  more regular cycles of glaciation and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the glacial drift of the continents alone

3  According to paragraph 1  what persuaded Louis Agassiz that glaciation in the past had been widespread
 Geologic differences between mountain valleys and flat plains
 The presence of similar glacial material in many different regions
 Geologic research on mountain glaciers in the Alps
 Evidence of regional differences in the drift caused by glacial erosion


4  The word  enjoy  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 experience
 resemble
 expect
 dominate

5  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Agassiz and other geologists of his time were not able to determine
 which geographic regions had been covered with ice sheets in the last ice age
 the exact dates at which drifts had been deposited during the last ice age
 the exact composition of the drifts laid during the last ice age
 how far south along the east coast of the United States the ice had advanced during the last ice age
6  According to paragraph 3  what did geologists conclude as a result of finding well developed soils containing warm climate plant fossils between layers of glacial drift
 There had been only one warm period before the Pleistocene epoch
 There had been multiple periods of mild weather between ice ages
 Several glacial periods occurred after the Pleistocene epoch
 Some earlier epochs were warmer than the Pleistocene


7  According to paragraph 3 and 4  scientists modified their theory about the exact number of glaciations because of evidence obtained from
  ocean sediments
 interglacial soils
 glacial deposits
 air samples

8  The word  reveal  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 result from
 vary with
 show
 preserve

9  According to paragraph 4  scientists use foraminifera shells to learn about Pleistocene ocean conditions by
 measuring the amount of calcium carbonate present in the shells
 determining the proportion of shell in each layer of sediment
 comparing shells deposited during the Pleistocene with those buried earlier
 calculating the relative quantity of two oxygen isotopes in the calcite



10  In can be inferred from paragraph 5 that foraminifera fossil shells containing calcite with high percentages of oxygen 16 were deposited at times when
 polar ice extended as far as equatorial regions of land and sea
 extensive glaciation was not occurring
 there were no great increases in ocean temperature
 there was heavy snowfall on continental glaciers

11 In paragraph 5  why does the author include the information that the  oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice
 To explain how scientists were able to calculate how frequently the continental ice sheets expanded and contracted
 To explain how scientists have determined that there was no great change in ocean temperatures at the equator during past glaciations
 To provide evidence that oxygen 16 has a greater tendency to evaporate than does oxygen 18
 To suggest that equatorial marine organisms absorb more heavy isotopes than do marine organisms elsewhere

12  According to the passage  when did scientists begin to realize that more than one ice age had occurred
 In the mid nineteenth century
 In the late nineteenth century
 In the early twentieth century
 In the late twentieth century

Louis Agassiz was the first to note signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation in diverse regions of Europe and North America








Answer Choices

 Evidence of a pattern of glacier like deposits eventually convinced most geologists that an enormous continental glacier had extended into the temperate zone
 Glacial research showed that many layers of ice were deposited  with each new period of glaciation extending farther south than the one before
 Isotopic analysis of marine sediments showed that periods of glaciation and deglaciation were more frequent  shorter  and more cyclic than previously thought
 Nineteenth century geologists came to accept the idea that the areas covered by polar ice had reached as far as the equator  a far larger area than Agassiz had thought
 Nineteenth century geologists studying the layers of drift concluded that during the Pleistocene epoch  several glaciations had occurred with warm periods between them
 Research involving foraminifera fossil shells show that ocean temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere varied greatly during the most extensive periods of glaciation
