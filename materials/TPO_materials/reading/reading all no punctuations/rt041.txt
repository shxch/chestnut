Deer Populations of the Puget Sound
Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States  The black tailed deer  a lowland  west side cousin of the mule deer of eastern Washington  is now the most common  The other species  the Columbian white tailed deer  in earlier times was common in the open prairie country  it is now restricted to the low  marshy islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River
Nearly any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer s diet  Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants  the black tailed deer browses on huckleberry  salal  dogwood  and almost any other shrub or herb  But this is fair weather feeding  What keeps the black tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy  One compensation for not hibernating is the built in urge to migrate  Deer may move from high elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall  Even with snow on the ground  the high bushy understory is exposed  also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar  hemlock  red alder  and other arboreal fodder
The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country  The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal  Famous explorers of the North American frontier  Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14  1805  in nearly starved circumstances  They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk  To keep 40 people alive that winter  they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer  And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring  the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation  Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century  when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson s Bay Company  deer populations continued to fluctuate  David Douglas  Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s  found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832  A recent Douglas biographer states   The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone  in 1832   hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops
Reduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times  A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land  logging  burning  and clearing  eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads  cities  towns  and factories  No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further  Recall the fate of the Columbian white tailed deer  now in a protected status  But for the black tailed deer  human pressure has had just the opposite effect  Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner  1953   in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time  says that  since the early 1940s  the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history  the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320 000 deer  mule and black tailed deer   which will yield about 65 000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period
The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions  First  the major predators of deer wolves  cougar  and lynx have been greatly reduced in numbers  Second  conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting  But the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests  Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging  fire  or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer  In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse  like huckleberry and vine maple  Arthur Einarsen  longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest  found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive  The protein content of shade grown vegetation  for example  was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings





1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is true of the white tailed deer of Puget Sound
 It is native to lowlands and marshes
 It is more closely related to the mule deer of eastern Washington than to other types of deer
 It has replaced the black tailed deer in the open prairie
 It no longer lives in a particular type of habitat that it once occupied


2  It can be inferred from the discussion in paragraph 2 that winter conditions
 cause some deer to hibernate
 make food unavailable in the highlands for deer
 make it easier for deer to locate understory plants
 prevent deer from migrating during the winter

3  The word  inhibits  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 consists of
 combines
 restricts
 establishes



















4  The phrase  in the same breath  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 impatiently
 humorously
 continuously
 immediately

5  The author tells the story of the explorers Lewis and Clark in paragraph 3 in order to illustrate which of the following points
 The number of deer within the Puget Sound region has varied over time
 Most of the explorers who came to the Puget Sound area were primarily interested in hunting game
 There was more game for hunting in the East of the United States than in the West
 Individual explorers were not as successful at locating games as were the trading companies

6  According to paragraph 3  how had Fort Vancouver changed by the time David Douglas returned in 1832
 The fort had become the headquarters for the Hudson s Bay Company
 Deer had begun populating the meadows around the fort
 Deer populations near the fort had been destroyed
 Crop yields in the area around the fort had decreased
















   7  Why does the author ask readers to recall  the fate of the Columbian white tailed deer  in the discussion of changes in the wilderness landscape
 To provide support for the idea that habitat destruction would lead to population decline
 To compare how two species of deer caused biotic changes in the wilderness environment
 To provide an example of a species of deer that has successfully adapted to human settlement
 To argue that some deer species must be given a protected status

 8  The phrase  indefinite period  in the passage is closest in meaning to period
 whose end has not been determined
 that does not begin when expected
 that lasts only briefly
 whose importance remains unknown

  9  Which of the following statements about deer populations is supported by the information in paragraph 4
 Deer populations reached their highest point during the 1940s and then began to decline
 The activities of settlers contributed in unexpected ways to the growth of some deer populations in later times
 The cleaning of wilderness land for construction caused biotic changes from which the black tailed deer population has never recovered
 Since the 1940s the winter populations of deer have fluctuated more than the summer populations have

10．The word  rebound  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 decline
 recovery
 exchange
 movement



11．Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Arthur Einarsen s longtime family with the Pacific Northwest helped him discover areas where deer had an increase in suitable browse
 Arthur Einarsen found that deforested feeding grounds provided deer with more and better food
 Biologist like Einarsen believe it is important to find additional open areas with suitable browse for deer to inhabit
 According to Einarsen  huckleberry and vine maple are examples of vegetation that may someday improve the nutrition of deer in the open areas of the Pacific Northwest

 A reduction in the number of predators
 Restrictions on hunting
 The effects of logging and fire
 Laws that protected feeding grounds of deer

13．Look at the four squares  █  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
There food is available and accessible throughout the winter
Where would the sentence best fit






14． Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Deer in the Puget Sound area eat a wide variety of foods and migrate seasonally to find food




Answer Choices

 The balance of deer species in the Puget Sound region has changed over time  with the Columbian white tailed deer now outnumbering other types of deer
 Deer populations naturally fluctuate  but early settlers in the Puget Sound environment caused an overall decline in the deer populations of the areas at that time
 In the long term  black tailed deer in the Puget Sound area have benefitted from human activities through the elimination of their natural predators  and more and better food in deforested areas
 Because Puget Sound deer migrate  it was and still remains difficult to determine accurately how many deer are living at any one time in the western United States
 Although it was believed that human settlement of the American West would cause the total number of deer to decrease permanently  the opposite has occurred for certain types of deer
 Wildlife biologists have long been concerned that the loss of forests may create nutritional deficiencies for deer
