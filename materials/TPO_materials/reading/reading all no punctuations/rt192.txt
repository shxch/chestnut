Succession  Climax  and Ecosystems
In the late nineteenth century  ecology began to grow into an independent science from its roots in natural history and plant geography  The emphasis of this new  community ecology  was on the composition and structure of communities consisting of different species  In the early twentieth century  the American ecologist Frederic Clements pointed out that a succession of plant communities would develop after a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption  heavy flood  or forest fire  An abandoned field  for instance  will be invaded successively by herbaceous plants  plants with little or no woody tissue   shrubs  and trees  eventually becoming a forest  Light loving species are always among the first invaders  while shade tolerant species appear later in the succession
Clements and other early ecologists saw almost lawlike regularity in the order of succession  but that has not been substantiated  A general trend can be recognized  but the details are usually unpredictable  Succession is influenced by many factors  the nature of the soil  exposure to sun and wind  regularity of precipitation  chance colonizations  and many other random processes
The final stage of a succession  called the climax by Clements and early ecologists  is likewise not predictable or of uniform composition  There is usually a good deal of turnover in species composition  even in a mature community  The nature of the climax is influenced by the same factors that influenced succession  Nevertheless  mature natural environments are usually in equilibrium  They change relatively little through time unless the environment itself changes
For Clements  the climax was a  superorganism   an organic entity  Even some authors who accepted the climax concept rejected Clements  characterization of it as a superorganism  and it is indeed a misleading metaphor  An ant colony may be legitimately called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances  But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation  Many authors prefer the term  association  to the term  community  in order to stress the looseness of the interaction
Even less fortunate was the extension of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants  This resulted in the  biome   a combination of coexisting flora and fauna  Though it is true that many animals are strictly associated with certain plants  it is misleading to speak of a  spruce moose biome   for example  because there is no internal cohesion to their association as in an organism  The spruce community is not substantially affected by either the presence or absence of moose  Indeed  there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose  The opposition to the Clementsian concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason  soon joined by various other ecologists  Their major point was that the distribution of a given species was controlled by the habitat requirements of that species and that therefore the vegetation types were a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species
With  climax    biome    superorganism   and various other technical terms for the association of animals and plants at a given locality being criticized  the term  ecosystem  was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of associated organisms together with the physical factors of their environment  Eventually  the energy transforming role of such a system was emphasized  Ecosystems thus involve the circulation  transformation  and accumulation of energy and matter through the medium of living things and their activities  The ecologist is concerned primarily with the quantities of matter and energy that pass through a given ecosystem  and with the rates at   which they do so
Although the ecosystem concept was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s  it is no longer the dominant paradigm  Gleason s arguments against climax and biome are largely valid against ecosystems as well  Furthermore  the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to analyze  even with the help of large computers  Finally  younger ecologists have found ecological problems involving behavior and life history adaptations more attractive than measuring physical constants  Nevertheless  one still speaks of the ecosystem when referring to a local association of animals and plants  usually without paying much attention to the energy aspects



1  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is a criticism of Clements  view of succession
 The principles of succession are more lawlike than Clements thought they are
 More evidence is needed to establish Clements  predictions about succession
 The details of succession are affected by random processes
 Many of the factors that determine which plants will grow in an environment  such as the nature of the soil and the exposure to sun  do not change at all

 lawlike regularity
 tendency

4  The word  likewise  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 sometimes
 similarly
 apparently
 consequently



5  The word  legitimately  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 commonly
 broadly
 properly
 officially

6  According to paragraph 4  why do many authors prefer the term  association  to  community  when describing a climax plant formation
 Because the term  association  does not suggest the presence of a tight network involving interactive communication
  Because the term  association  indicates that the grouping is not necessarily beneficial to all members
 Because the term  community  indicates continuing dynamic development that a climax formation does not have
 Because the term  community  suggests an organization that has been designed for a specific purpose

7  In paragraph 5  the author challenges the idea of a  biome  by noting that
 there are usually no very strong connections among the plants and animals living in a place
 plants and animals respond in the same way to the same circumstances
 particular combinations of flora and fauna do not generally come about purely by chance
 some animals are dependent on specific kinds of plants for food

8  Why does the author make the statement   Indeed  there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose
 To highlight a fact whose significance the ecologist Herbert Gleason had missed
 To propose the idea that a spruce forest is by itself a superorganism
 To emphasize that moose are not limited to a single kind of environment
 To criticize the idea of a spruce moose biome

9  The word  initiated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 approved
 identified
 started
 foreseen

10  According to paragraph 5  Gleason s opposition to the Clementsian views of plant ecology was based on the claim that plant species grow in places where
 they can enter into mutually beneficial relationships with other species
 conditions suit them  regardless of whether particular other species are present
 habitats are available for a wide variety of plant and animal species
 their requirements are met  and those of most other species are not















11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Unlike the terms  climax    biome    and  superorganism    which refer to the particular association of plants and animals at a given location  the term  ecosystem  refers specifically to the physical factors within an environment
 The terms  climax    biome    superorganism   and  ecosystem  all refer to the system of plants and animals in an associated environment  but some are more controversial than others
 When the older terms of ecology became too technical  they were replaced by the more popular and more widely used term  ecosystem
 The term  ecosystem  gradually replaced discredited terms for the combination of a physical environment and the plants and animals living together in it


12  According to paragraph 6  what did ecologists mainly study when the ecosystem concept was the dominant paradigm
 The physical factors present in different environments
 The typical activities of animals and the effect of those activities on plants
 The rates at which ecosystems changed from one kind to another
 The flow of energy and matter through ecosystems






13 Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
They may be more interested in researching  for example  the adaptations that some aquatic animals undergo to survive in dry desert environments
Where would the sentence best fit



14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

The study of the combination of plant species that inhabit a particular locality became a scientific discipline toward the end of the nineteenth century








Answer Choices

 Areas that are recovering from serious disturbances like volcanic eruptions and heavy floods provide special opportunities to observe the development of plant communities
 Whether a given species will be found in a given ecosystem strongly depends on what other species it would interact with in that ecosystem
 Computer aided studies of entire system of associated organisms together with their environment provide a solid basis for current studies of specific ecological problems
 According to the earliest theories of ecology  the development of plant communities proceeds in lawlike fashion and results in stable climax communities
 The idea of associations of plants and animals that function as  superorganisms  was later rejected by biologists who saw no strong evidence in support of that idea
 The once popular idea of communities as integrated ecosystems has been largely rejected by modern ecologists  who are more interested in problems involving behavior and adaptations
