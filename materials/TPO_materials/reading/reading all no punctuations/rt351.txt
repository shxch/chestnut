Europe in the twelfth century
Europe in the eleventh century underwent enormous social  technological  and economic changes  but this did not create a new Europe it created two new ones  The north was developed as a rigidly hierarchical society in which status was determined  or was at least indicated  by the extent to which one owned  controlled  or labored on land  whereas the Mediterranean south developed a more fluid  and therefore more chaotic  world in which industry and commerce predominated and social status both reflected and resulted from the role that one played in the public life of the community  In other words  individual identity and social community in the north were established on a personal basis  whereas in the south they were established on a civic basis   By the start of the twelfth century  northern and southern Europe were very different places indeed  and the Europeans themselves noticed it and commented on it

Political dominance belonged to the north  Germany  France  and England had large populations and large armies that made them  in the political and military senses  the masters of Western Europe  Organized by the practices known collectively as feudalism   these kingdoms emerged as powerful states with sophisticated machineries of government  Their kings and queens were the leading figures of the age  their castles and cathedrals stood majestically on the landscape as symbols of their might  their armies both energized and defined the age  Moreover  feudal society showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new needs by encouraging the parallel development of domestic urban life and commercial networks  in some regions of the north  in fact  feudal society may even have developed in response to the start of the trends toward bigger cities  But southern Europe took the lead in economic and cultural life  Though the leading Mediterranean states were small in size  they were considerably wealthier than their northern counterparts  The Italian city of Palermo in the twelfth century  for example  alone generated four times the commercial tax revenue of the entire kingdom of England  Southern communities also possessed urbane  multilingual cultures that made them the intellectual and artistic leaders of the age  Levels of general literacy in the south far surpassed those of the north  and the people of the south put that learning to use on a large scale  Science  mathematics  poetry  law  historical writing  religious speculation  translation  and classical studies all began to flourish  throughout most of the twelfth century  most of the continent s best brains flocked to southern Europe

So too did a lot of the north s soldiers  One of the central themes of the political history of the twelfth century was the continual effort by the northern kingdoms to extend their control southward in the hope of tapping into the Mediterranean bonanza  The German emperors starting with Otto I  936 973   for example  struggled ceaselessly to establish their control over the cities of northern Italy  since those cities generated more revenue than all of rural Germany combined  The kings of France used every means at their disposal to push the lower border of their kingdom to the Mediterranean shoreline  And the Normans who conquered and ruled England established outposts of Norman power in Sicily and the adjacent lands of southern Italy  the English kings also hoped or claimed at various times to be  either through money or marriage diplomacy  the rulers of several Mediterranean states  But as the northern world pressed southward  so too did some of the cultural norms and social mechanisms of the south expand northward  Over the course of the twelfth century  the feudal kingdoms witnessed a proliferation of cities modeled in large degree on those of the south  Contact with the merchants and financiers of the Mediterranean led to the development of northern industry and international trade  which helped to pay for many of the castles and cathedrals mentioned earlier   And education spread as well  culminating in the foundation of what is arguably medieval Europe s greatest invention  the university  The relationship of north and south was symbiotic  in other words  and the contrast between them was more one of differences in degree than of polar opposition
