Now in Europe in the Middle Ages before the invention of printing and the printing press  all books  all manuscripts were hand made  And the material typically used for the pages was parchment  which is animal skin that s stretched and dried under tension  so it become s really flat and can be written on   During the 1400s  when printing was being developed  paper became the predominant material for books in Europe  but prior to that  it was parchment  Parchment is durable  much more so than paper  and it could be reused which came in handy since it was a costly material and in short supply  so it wasn t uncommon for the scribes or monks who produced the manuscripts

Ah  remember before printing books were made mainly in monasteries   Well  the scribes often recycled the parchment that d been used for earlier manuscripts  They simply
erased the ink off the parchment and wrote something new in its place
A manuscript page that was written on  erased and then used again is
called a palimpsest

Palimpsests were created  well  we know about two methods that were used for removing ink from parchment  In the late Middle Ages  it was customary to scrape away the surface of the parchment with an abrasive  which completely wiped out any writing that was there  But earlier in the Middle Ages  the original ink was usually removed by washing the used parchment with milk  That removed the ink  But with the passing of time  the original writing might reappear  In fact   it might reappear to the extent that scholars could make out and even decipher the original text

Perhaps  the most famous example is the Archimedes  palimpsest

Archimedes lived in Greece around 200 BCE  and as you probably know  he s considered one of the greatest Mathematicians who ever lived  even though many of his writings had been lost   including what many now think to be his most important work called The Method

But in 1998  a book of prayers from the Middle Ages sold in an art auction for a lot of money  more money than anyone would pay for a damaged book from the 12th century  Beautiful or not  why  It had been discovered that the book was a palimpsest  and beneath the surface writing of the manuscript laid  guess what  Mathematical theorems and diagrams from Archimedes

Archimedes  writings were originally done on papyrus scrolls  Then in the 10th century  a scribe made a copy on parchment of some of his texts and diagrams including  as it turns out  The Method   This was extremely fortunate  since later on  the original papyrus scrolls disappeared  About 200 years later in the 12th century  this parchment manuscript became a palimpsest when a scribe used the parchment to make a prayer book  So the pages  the pieces of parchment themselves  had been preserved  But the Archimedes  text was erased and written over  and no one knew it existed

It wasn t until 1906 that a scholar came across the prayer book in a library and realized it was a palimpsest  and that the underlying layer of texts could only have come from Archimedes  That was when his work The Method was discovered for the first time

Um    the palimpsest then went through some more tough times  but eventually it ended up in an art auction where was bought and then donated to an art museum in Baltimore  for conservation and study  To avoid further damage to the manuscript  the research team at the art museum has had to be extremely selective in the techniques they used to see the original writing  They ve used ultraviolet light and some other techniques  and if you re interested in that sort of thing  you can learn more about it in an art conservation class

But actually  it was a physicist who came up with a method that was a breakthrough  He realized that the iron in the ancient ink would display if exposed to a certain X ray imaging method  and except for small portions of the text that couldn t be deciphered  this technique s been very helpful in seeing Archimedes  texts and drawings through the medieval overwriting
