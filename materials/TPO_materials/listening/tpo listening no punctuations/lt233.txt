TPO23 Lecture2   Environmental Science  Earth Budget
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class
Professor  Basically  a cloud either contributes to the cooling of Earth s surface or to its heating  Earth s climate system is constantly trying to strike a balance between the cooling and warming effects of clouds
It s very close  but overall the cumulative effects of cloud are to cool Earth rather than heat it  And this balance between the amount of solar radiation  energy from the Sun  that s absorbed by Earth  and the amount that s reflected back into space  We call this Earth s radiation budget  And one way we keep track of the radiation budget is by looking at the albedo of the different surfaces on the planet
A surface s albedo is the percentage of incoming solar energy  sunlight  that s reflected off that surface back into space  Oceans have a low albedo  because they reflect very little energy  Most of the solar energy that reaches the ocean gets absorbed and heats the water  Um    rainforests also have low albedos  Well  by contrast  deserts and areas covered by ice and snow  these places have high albedos  And clouds  in general  cloud also have high albedos  That means that a large percentage of the solar energy clouds receive is reflected into space
OK  Now  when we say that clouds have a high albedo  We are talking about the effect of all the clouds on earth averaged together  But different types of clouds have different reflective properties  they have different albedos
Student  So which type of clouds cools Earth  And which type heat it
Professor  Well  high thin clouds contribute to heating while low thick clouds cool Earth  High thin clouds are very transparent to solar radiation  like  uh  clear air  So they mostly transmit incoming solar energy down to Earth  There s not much reflection going at all  At the same time  these clouds trap in some of Earth s heat  Because of the trapped heat  these clouds have an overall heating effect
Student  Oh  OK  Since low thick clouds are not transparent to radiation
Professor  Exactly  They block most of the solar energy so it never reaches Earth s surface  They reflect much of it back out into space
Student  So that s how they contribute to cooling
Professor  Yep  And as I said earlier  this cooling effect predominates  Now  what if there was a process that could control the type of clouds that form
Student  Are you talking about controlling the weather
Professor  Well  I am not sure I would go that far  But we recently noticed an increase in cloud cover over an area of the ocean waters around Antarctica  An increased area of low thick clouds  the type that reflects a lare portion of solar energy back to space and cools the Earth
Well  the reason for this increased cloud cover  it turns out  is the exceptionally large amount of microscopic marine plants  Well  the current hypothesis is that these microorganisms produce a chemical  dimetho sulfide that interacts with the oxygen in the air  creating conditions that lead to the formation of the low thick clouds we observed  Well  that s true  It could have huge implications  So  maybe we are talking about controlling the weather  Perhaps  if the microorganisms near Antarctica really are responsible  perhaps we can accelerate the process somehow
