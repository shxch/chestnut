Pro  So we ve been talking about the printing press  how it changed people s lives  making books more accessible to everyone  More books meant more reading  right  But  as you know  not everyone has perfect vision  This increase in literacy  um  in reading  led to an increase in demand for eyeglasses  And here s something you probably haven t thought of  This increased demand impacted societal attitudes towards eyeglasses

But  first let me back up a bit and talk about vision correction before the printing press  And  um  what did people with poor vision do  I mean  especially those few people who were actually literate  What did they do before glasses were invented  Well  they had different ways of dealing with not seeing well  If you think about it  poor vision wasn t their only problem  I mean  um  think about the conditions they lived in  houses were dark  sometimes there weren t any windows  candles were the only source of light  So in some places  um  like ancient Greece for example  the wealthiest people with poor vision could have someone else read to them  easy solution if you could afford it

Another solution was something called a  reading stone   Around 1000 C E  European monks would take a piece of clear rock  often quartz  and place it on top of the reading material  The clear rock magnified the letters  making them appear larger  um  well  it s like what happens when a drop of water falls on something  whatever s below the drop of water appears larger  right  Well  the  reading stone  works in a similar way

But rocks like quartz  well  quartz of optical quality weren t cheap  Late in the 13th century  glass makers in Italy came up with a less expensive alternative  They made reading stones out of clear glass  And these clear glass reading stones evolved into the eyeglasses we know today  So we re pretty sure that glasses were invented about the late 1200 s  well  over a hundred years before the printing press  But it s not clear who exactly invented them first or exactly what year  But record shows that they were invented in both Europe and China at about the same time  By the way  we call this  independent discovery   Independent discovery means when something is invented in different parts of the world at the same time and it s not as unusual as it sounds  You can look at the timeline charts in the back of your textbook to see when things were invented in different cultures at about the same time to see what I m talking about

So now let s tie this to what I ve said before about societal attitudes towards glasses  Initially in parts of Europe and in China  glasses were a symbol of wisdom and intelligence  This is evident in the artwork from the period  European paintings often portrayed doctors or judges wearing glasses  In China  glasses were very expensive  So in addition to intelligence  they also symbolize affluence  um  wealth  In 14th century Chinese portraits  the bigger the glasses  the smarter and wealthier the subject was  So glasses were a status symbol in some parts of the world

Now let s get back to the invention of the painting press in 1440  What happened  Suddenly  books became readily available and more people wanted to read  So the need  oh well  actually not only the need but the demand for more affordable glasses rose drastically  Eventually  inexpensive glasses were produced  and then glasses were available to everyone  People could purchase them easily from a traveling peddler
