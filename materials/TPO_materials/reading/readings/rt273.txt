Predator Prey Cycles
How do predators affect populations of the prey animals  The answer is not as simple as might be thought  Moose reached Isle Royale in Lake Superior by crossing over winter ice and multiplied freely there in isolation without predators  When wolves later reached the island  naturalists widely assumed that the wolves would play a key role in controlling the moose population  Careful studies have demonstrated  however  that this is not the case  The wolves eat mostly old or diseased animals that would not survive long anyway  In general  the moose population is controlled by food availability  disease and other factors rather than by wolves

When experimental populations are set up under simple laboratory conditions  the predator often exterminates its pre and then becomes extinct itself  having nothing left to eat  However  if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided  the prey population drops to low level but not extinction  Low prey population levels then provide inadequate food for the predators  causing the predator population to decrease  When this occurs  the prey population can rebound  In this situation the predator and prey population may continue in this cyclical pattern for some time

Population cycles are characteristic of small mammals  and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators  Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snow shoe hare follows a roughly ten year cycle  Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a typical cycle  and a hundredfold change can occur  Two factors appear to be generating the cycle  food plants and predators

The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are willow and birch twigs  As hare density increases  the quantity of these twigs decreases  forcing the hares to feed on low quality high fiber food  Lower birth rates  low juvenile survivorship  and low growth rates follow  so there is a corresponding decline in hare abundance  Once the hare population has declined  it takes two to three year for the quantity of twigs to recover

A key predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx  The Canada lynx shows a ten year cycle of abundance that parallels the abundance cycle of hares  As hare numbers fall  so do lynx numbers  as their food supply depleted

What causes the predator prey oscillations  Do increasing number of hares lead to overharvesting of plants  which in turn results in reduced hare populations  or do increasing numbers of lynx lead to overharvesting hares  Field experiments carried out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992 provide an answer  Krebs investigated experimental plots in Canada s Yukon territory that contained hare populations  When food was added to those plots  no food effect  and predators were excluded  no predator effect  from an experimental area  hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed there the cycle was lost  However  the cycle was retained if either of the factors was allowed to operate alone  if predators were excluded but food was not added  food effect alone   or if food was added in the presence of predators  predator effect alone   Thus both factors can affect the cycle  which  in practice  seems to be generated by conjunction of the two factors

Predators are an essential factor in maintaining communities that are rich and diverse in species  Without predators  the species that is the best competitor for food  shelter  nesting sites  and other environmental resources tends to dominate and exclude the species with which it competes  This phenomenon is known as  competitor exclusion   However  if the community contains a predator of the strongest competitor species  then the population of that competitor is controlled  Thus even the less competitive species are able to survive  For example  sea stars prey on a variety of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor  This opens up space for many other organisms  When sea stars are removed  species diversity falls sharply  Therefore  from the stand point of diversity  it is usually a mistake to eliminate a major predator from a community



1  In paragraph 1  why does the author discuss the moose and wolves on Isle Royal
 To provide an example of predators moving to new habitats by following migrating prey
 To show that the interactions between predator populations and prey populations are not always might be expected
 To suggest that prey populations are more influenced by predation than food availability and disease
 To argue that studies of geographically isolated populations tend not to be useful to naturalists


2  The word  rebound  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  escape
  recover
  survive
  resist

3  Paragraph 2 implies which of the following about experimental environments in which predators become extinct
  They may yield results that do not accurate predict changes of populations in the wild
  In these environments  the prey species is better adapted than the predator species
  These environments are appropriate only for studying small populations of predators and prey
  They are unrealistic because some predators are also the prey of other predators

4  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about the small mammals that experience population cycles
  Their population cycles are not affected by predators
  Their predators  populations periodically disappear
  They typically undergo ten year cycles
  They have access to places safe from predators

5  The word  roughly  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  usually
  repeating
  approximately
  observable

6  The word  generating  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  producing
  changing
  speeding up
  smoothing out



7  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are true of the food of snowshoe hares EXCEPT
  The preferred food fore hares consists of willow and birch twigs
  High fiber food is the most nutritious for hares
  Depletion of the supply of willow and birch twigs cause low birth and growth rates
  The food supply takes two or three years to recover after a peak in hare population density

8  The word  conjunction  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  determination
  combination
  alternation
  transformation


9  According to paragraph 5  which of the following statements best characterizes the abundance cycle of the Canada lynx
  It closely follows the cycle the snowshoe hare
  When the numbers of lynx fall  the numbers of snowshoe hares soon decrease
  When hare numbers decrease  lynx numbers increase
  It is not clearly related to the availability of lynx food
10  According to paragraph 6  which of the following was true of the hare population cycle in Krebs s experiment
  The effects of providing food while at the same time introducing predators cancelled each other  so there was no cycle
  The cycle existed when either the food supply was limited or there were predators
  There was a cycle when there were no predators and food was supplied
  If the hares had places to hide from the lynx  the hare population increased tenfold and then remained at that level
11  According to paragraph 7  which of the following statements correctly characterizes the effect of sea stars on the ecosystem in which they are predators of bivalves
  Bivalve population are kept low  allowing species that compete with bivalves to survive
  The numbers of most species of bivalves are greatly reduced  leaving the bivalve species that is the strongest competitor to dominate among the survivors
  Biological diversity begins to decrease because many bivalve species disappear
  Sea stars dominate at first but then die off because of the depleted food supply
12  According to paragraph 7  which of the following is true of the phenomenon of competitor exclusion
  It results in more diverse communities
  It requires the presence of predators
  It affects all competitions equally
  It happens only when there is a dominant competitor
13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
As a result  there are not enough of the strong competitions to monopolize the environment s resources
Where would the sentence best fit
14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
The relationships between predators and prey are complex



Answer Choices

  Studies of the interactions between wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior reveal that wolf predation is not the primary factor controlling the moose population
  Predators help maintain biological diversity by limiting populations of a dominant competitor species  thereby preventing that species from excluding others
  A species  population tends to rise and falls in a cycle pattern if the food supply for the population is limited  or if the population has a major predator
  Ecologists are interested in studying predator prey population cycles because understanding how predators and prey interact will allow better wildlife management programs
  In predator prey population cycles  predator populations increase or decrease following similar population changes in the species they prey on
  The removal of sea stars reduces the diversity of the community in which they are predators  and is therefore a bad idea
