Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a paleontology class

Professor
As we ve discussed  birds are apparently descendants of dinosaurs and shared many commonalities with some dinosaur species  like…um…feathers and maybe even flight and of course egg laid  OK

So  many paleontologists  myself included  have wondered about other similarities between dinosaurs and birds  Since adult dinosaur fossils have sometimes been discovered near or on top of nests  we ve been looking at the dinosaur parenting behavior

Student
Parenting behavior  well  that sounds so gentle and caring  But dinosaurs were ferocious reptiles and reptiles don t take care of their young  do they

Professor
Well  some reptiles incubate their eggs  crocodiles do  And as for popular attitudes towards dinosaurs…well  take the Oviraptor for instance

In the 1920s  a paleontologist discovered the fossil remains of a small dinosaur near a nest containing eggs  He assumed the dinosaur was stealing the eggs  so he named it Oviraptor that means egg thief in Latin  which fueled the generally negative public image of such dinosaurs

But by the 1990s  other experts had convincingly made the case that instead of robbing the nest  the Oviraptor was probably taking care of the eggs  You see  dinosaurs  closest living relatives – birds and crocodiles – display nesting behavior  And dinosaur fossils have been found in postures that we now believe to indicate brooding behavior  that is  sitting on the eggs until they hatch

So we are curious about the type of care dinosaurs gave to their young  And we d like to figure out which dinosaur parent  the male or the female gave the care

Student
Shouldn t the behavior of crocodiles and birds give us some clues then

Professor
Well  with crocodiles  it is the female who guards the nest  and with birds  it depends on the species  it can be the male or the female that takes care the eggs  or both  In over 90 percent of all bird species  both parents take care of the eggs and the young birds

Student
But sometimes it s just the male

Professor
Well  exclusive care by the male parent is much less common  but it does occur  Now  for animals other than birds  the care of young by both parents is pretty unusual in the animal kingdom  Males contribute to parental care in fewer than five percent of all mammalian species  It s even less frequent among reptiles  And exclusive care by the male is very rare  So researchers have wondered about the evolution of male parenting behavior in birds for quite some time  And now there s research showing that for some of the birds  dinosaur relatives  it s likely that the male parent was also in charge of taking care of the eggs

Student
How did they figure that out

Professor
Well  first they looked at clutch volume  that s the number of eggs in the nest of crocodiles  birds and three types of dinosaurs  including Oviraptors that are thought to be closely related to the dinosaur ancestors of birds

So when researchers examined fossilized remains of nests  they found that the dinosaurs had larger clutch volumes  more eggs in the nests that is  than most of the crocodiles and birds that were studied  But  and this is important  their clutch volumes matched those of birds that have only male parental care  You see  bird species in which only the males take care of the nest tend to have the largest clutches of eggs

Student
So what s the connection between bird and dinosaur behavior

Professor
Well  researchers now believe  because of this study  that the male parenting behavior of these birds might have its origins in the behavior of dinosaurs

Student
Based only on evidence of clutch volume size  the number of eggs

Professor
No  there s more  They also examined the fossilized bones of those three types of dinosaurs that were found on or near nests to determine their sex  You see  adult female birds during egg production produce a layer of spongy bone tissue inside certain long bones  And so did female dinosaurs of the kinds that were investigated  This spongy tissue serves as a source of calcium for eggshell formation  But when the dinosaur fossils were examined  there were no spongy bone deposits

Student
Meaning that those dinosaurs on the nests were probably adult males who wouldn t have needed calcium for making eggshells

Professor
Exactly  And then there s this  birds like the kiwi  the ostrich and the emu  they share certain physical characteristics with these dinosaurs  And interestingly  they also show a consistent pattern of nest care by the male
