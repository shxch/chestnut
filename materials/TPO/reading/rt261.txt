Energy and the Industrial Revolution

For years historians have sought to identify crucial elements in the eighteenth century rise in industry  technology  and economic power known as the Industrial Revolution  and many give prominence to the problem of energy  Until the eighteenth century  people relied on energy derived from plants as well as animal and human muscle to provide power  Increased efficiency in the use of water and wind helped with such tasks as pumping  milling  or sailing  However  by the eighteenth century  Great Britain in particular was experiencing an energy shortage  Wood  the primary source of heat for homes and industries and also used in the iron industry as processed charcoal  was diminishing in supply  Great Britain had large amounts of coal  however  there were not yet efficient means by which to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery  This was to occur with progress in the development of the steam engine

In the late 1700s James Watt designed an efficient and commercially viable steam engine that was soon applied to a variety of industrial uses as it became cheaper to use  The engine helped solve the problem of draining coal mines of groundwater and increased the production of coal needed to power steam engines elsewhere  A rotary engine attached to the steam engine enabled shafts to be turned and machines to be driven  resulting in mills using steam power to spin and weave cotton  Since the steam engine was fired by coal  the large mills did not need to be located by rivers  as had mills that used water  driven machines  The shift to increased mechanization in cotton production is apparent in the import of raw cotton and the sale of cotton goods  Between 1760 and 1850  the amount of raw cotton imported increased 230 times  Production of British cotton goods increased sixtyfold  and cotton cloth became Great Britain s most important product  accounting for one half of all exports  The success of the steam engine resulted in increased demands for coal  and the consequent increase in coal production was made possible as the steam powered pumps drained water from the ever deeper coal seams found below the water table

The availability of steam power and the demands for new machines facilitated the transformation of the iron industry  Charcoal  made from wood and thus in limited supply  was replaced with coal derived coke  substance left after coal is heated  as steam driven bellows came into use for producing of raw iron  Impurities were burnt away with the use of coke  producing a high quality refined iron  Reduced cost was also instrumental in developing steam powered rolling mills capable of producing finished iron of various shapes and sizes  The resulting boom in the iron industry expanded the annual iron output by more than 170 times between 1740 and 1840  and by the 1850s Great Britain was producing more tons of iron than the rest of the world combined  The developments in the iron industry were in part a response to the demand for more machines and the ever widening use of higher quality iron in other industries

Steam power and iron combined to revolutionize transport  which in turn had further implications  Improvements in road construction and sailing had occurred  but shipping heavy freight over land remained expensive  even with the use of rivers and canals wherever possible  Parallel rails had long been used in mining operations to move bigger loads  but horses were still the primary source of power  However  the arrival of the steam engine initiated a complete transformation in rail transportation  entrenching and expanding the Industrial Revolution  As transportation improved  distant and larger markets within the nation could be reached  thereby encouraging the development of larger factories to keep pace with increasing sales  Greater productivity and rising demands provided entrepreneurs with profits that could be reinvested to take advantage of new technologies to further expand capacity  or to seek alternative investment opportunities  Also  the availability of jobs in railway construction attracted many rural laborers accustomed to seasonal and temporary employment  When the work was completed  many moved to other construction jobs or to factory work in cities and towns  where they became part of an expanding working class




1  Why does the author provide the information that  Great Britain had large amounts of coal
  To reject the claim that Britain was facing an energy shortage in the eighteenth century
  To explain why coal rather than other energy resources became the primary source of heat for homes and industries in eighteenth century Britain
 To indicate that Britain s energy shortage was not the result of a lack of fuel
  To explain why coal mining became an important industry in nineteenth century





2  What was  the problem of energy  that had to be solved to make the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century possible
  Water and wind could not be used efficiently
  There was no efficient way to power machinery
  Steam engines required large amounts of coal  which was in short supply
  Neither humans nor animals were strong enough to provide the power required for industrial application






3  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a development in cotton mills brought about by Watt s steam engine
  The importing of huge quantities of raw cotton by Britain
  Increased mechanization
  More possibilities for mill location
  Smaller mills

4  The phrase  apparent in  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  clearly seen in
  aided by
  associated with
  followed by

5  According to paragraph 2  what was Britain s most important export by 1850
  Raw cotton
  Cotton cloth
  Steam powered pumps
  Coal

6  The word  consequent  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  resulting
  encouraging
  well documented
  immediate

7  What is the role of paragraph 2 in the passage as a whole
  It explains how by increasing the supply of raw materials from other countries  British industries were able to reduce costs and increase production
  It explains how the production of mechanical energy and its benefits spread quickly across countries that were linked commercially with Great Britain
  It demonstrates why developments in a single industry could not have caused the Industrial Revolution
  It illustrates why historians have assigned great importance to the issue of energy in the rise of the Industrial Revolution


8  According to paragraph 3  why was the use of coke important for the iron industry
  It helped make wood into charcoal
  It reduced the dependency on steam powered machines used for the production of iron
  It replaced charcoal in the production of raw and refined iron
  It powered the machines used to extract coal in coal mines

9  According to paragraph 3  all of the following were true of the iron industry in Great Britain during the 1800s EXCEPT
  Steam driven bellows were used to produce raw iron
 By the 1850s Britain was the world s largest producer of iron
 Steam powered mills made it possible to produce iron of different shapes and sizes
  Greater demand for higher quality iron increased its price







10  The word  initiated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 anticipated
 accelerated
 spread
  started

11  Paragraph 4 implies which of the following about the transformation in rail transportation
 Because railway construction employed mostly rural laborers  unemployment increased among urban workers
  It resulted in more trade within the country  but less trade with markets that could be reached only by ocean shipping
  It made shipping freight overland to distant markets less expensive
  It resulted in higher wages for factory workers

12  The phrase  accustomed to  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  in need of
  used to
  tired of
  encouraged by

The coming of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth century Britain depended on the development of the steam engine to power machinery






Answer Choices

  For years  historians disregarded the issue of energy as a major element in the rise of the Industrial Revolution and focused instead on technological developments and increased production
  The introduction and growth of steam powered rail transport was a major factor in Britain s economic expansion during the Industrial Revolution
  An expansion of the Industrial Revolution outside Great Britain occurred when British industries began to import raw cotton and high quality iron
  By 1850  the use of steam power in Britain s mills  mines  and iron industry made Britain a world leader in the production of cotton cloth and iron
  Since the basic infrastructure was in place  the Industrial Revolution fueled itself with enlarging markets requiring ever more expansion of factories and workforce
  By the end of the 1800s  railway construction attracted so many laborers that factories could not find enough workers to keep up with increasing sales
