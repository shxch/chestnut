Questions 34-44 are based on the following passage.
Creating Worlds: A Career in Game Design
If you love video games and have thought about how
the games you play might be changed or improved, or if
you’ve imagined creating a video game of your own, you
might want to consider a career as a video game designer.
There 34 were a number of steps you can take to
determine whether game design is the right field for you
and, if it is, to prepare yourself for such a career.
Before making the choice, you should have some
sense of what a video game designer does. Every video
game, whether for a console, computer, or mobile device,
starts with a concept that originates in the mind of a
designer. The designer envisions the game’s fundamental
35 elements: the settings, characters, and plots that make
each game unique, and is thus a primary creative force
behind a video game.
Conceptualizing a game is only the beginning of a
video game designer’s 36 job, however, no matter how
good a concept is, it will never be translated into a video
game unless it is communicated effectively to all the other
members of the video game development team. 37 A
designer must generate extensive documentation and

At this point, the writer is considering adding the
following sentence.
Successful communication is essential if a
designer’s idea is to become a reality.
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Yes, because it supports the conclusion drawn in
the following sentence.
B) Yes, because it illustrates a general principle
discussed in the paragraph.
C) No, because it distracts from the focus of the
paragraph by introducing irrelevant material.

38 explain his or her ideas clearly in order to ensure that
the programmers, artists, and others on the team all share
the same vision. 39 Likewise, anyone considering a
career as a video game designer must be 40 skilled
writers and speakers. In addition, because video game
development is a collaborative effort and because the
development of any one game may take months or even
years, a designer must be an effective team player as well
as detail oriented.
[1] A basic understanding of computer programming
is essential. [2] In fact, many designers 41 initially begin
their pursuits as programmers. [3] Consider taking some
general computer science courses as well as courses in
artificial intelligence and graphics in order to increase
your understanding of the technical challenges involved
in developing a video game. [4] Courses in psychology
and human behavior may help you develop 42 emphatic
collaboration skills, while courses in the humanities, such
as in literature and film, should give you the background
necessary to develop effective narrative structures. [5] A

designer also needs careful educational preparation.
[6] Finally, because a designer should understand the
business aspects of the video game industry, such as
budgeting and marketing, you may want to consider
taking some business courses. [7] Although demanding
and deadline driven, 43 video game design can be a
lucrative and rewarding field for people who love gaming
and have prepared themselves with the necessary skills
and knowledge. 44
