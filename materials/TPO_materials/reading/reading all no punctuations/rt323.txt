In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how social interactions can produce and enforce regular spacing in a population  They studied competition and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica  Though these bees do no sting  rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites
Stingless bees are abundant in tropical and subtropical environments  where they gather nectar and pollen from a wide variety of flowers  They generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers  Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies  while other species are not  Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high density clumps  Nonaggressive species feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers
Hubbell and Johnson studied several species of stingless bees to determine whether there is a relationship between aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution  They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions  while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped  clumped  distribution  They concentrated their studies on a thirteen hectare tract of tropical dry forest that contained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees
Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions  they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions  So as one of the first steps in their study  they mapped the distributions of trees suitable for nesting  They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly through the study area  They also found that the number of potential nest sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies  What did these measurements show the researchers  The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by availability of suitable trees  and a clumped or regular distribution of colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or regular distribution of potential nest sites
Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately  and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly  All four species with regular nest distributions were highly aggressive to bees from other colonies of their own species  The fifth species was not aggressive  and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area
The researchers also studied the process by which the aggressive species establish new colonies  Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species  Aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with pheromones  chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their species  The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site  however  it also attracts workers from other nests
If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time  they may fight for possession  Fights may be escalated into protracted battles  The researchers observed battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks  Each dawn  fifteen to thirty workers from two competing colonies arrived at the contested nest site  The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other  In the displays  pairs of bees faced each other  slowly flew vertically to a height of about three meters  and then grappled each other to the ground  When the two bees hit the ground  they separated  faced off  and performed another aerial display  Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights  which were apparently ritualized  The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A M  each morning  only to re form and begin again the next day just after dawn  While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality  fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1  000 bees in a single battle


1 	The word  rival  in the passage is closest in leaning to
 established
 competing
 nearby
 different


2 	According to paragraph 2  some species of stingless bees are aggressive mainly toward
 Nonaggressive bees that forage on the same flowers
 Aggressive bees of other species
 Bees from their own colony
 Bees of their own species from different colonies

3 	According to paragraph 3  Hubbell and Johnson hypothesized that
 The distribution pattern of bee colonies determines the degree of aggressiveness the bees display
 Nests of nonaggressive bees have either a random or a clumped distribution  while nests of aggressive bees have a regular distribution
 nests of nonaggressive bees are generally both closer together and more regularly distributed than those of aggressive bees
 nests of aggressive bees tend to be more regular in shape than those of nonaggressive bees


 


4  According to paragraph 4  why did Hubbell and Johnson begin their study by mapping all the potential nest sites
 To determine whether the availability of potential nest sites played a role in the distribution of bee colonies
 To know exactly where in the study area the colonies of all the different bee species were located
 To be sure that suitable nesting sites were equally available in all parts of study area
 To find out whether different species of bees preferred different types of trees as potential nest sites

5  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The limited number of colonies was not due to the distribution or availability of potential nesting sites
 There was no lack of suitable trees or potential nesting sites in the study area
 The number of nests was directly related to the number or the distribution of suitable trees
 Neither the number nor the distribution of colonies could be explained by the availability of suitable nest sites


6  According to paragraph 5  Hubbell and Johnson determined
  the order in which the colonies in the study area had been established
  the level of aggressiveness of each of the nine species
  the distribution pattern of the nests of five of the nine species
  the number of colonies of each of the nine species

7  Why does the author indicate that  The fifth species was not aggressive  and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area
 To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson s original hypothesis
 To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness
 To introduce the hypothesis that  within the same species  not all colonies are aggressive
 To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites

9  According to paragraph 6  what is one result of using pheromones to mark nest sites
 The use of pheromones tends to result in nest clumping
  Pheromones attract animals other than bees to prospective nest sites
 Pheromones tend to make bees aggressive
 Pheromones secreted by bees of one colony also attract bees of other colonies

11  Paragraph 7 supports which of the following ideas about fights over occupied nests
 They are more violent than battles over unoccupied nest sites
 They mostly occur between colonies over unoccupied sites
 They are more frequent than battles over unoccupied sites
 They last longer than battles over unoccupied sites do

For example  a clumped distribution of nests might simply reflect a clumped distribution of suitable nesting sites
Where does the sentence best fit


13  Select from the seven sentences below the three sentences that correctly characterize aggressive species of stingless bees and the two sentences that correctly characterize nonaggressive species


  Aggressive Stingless Bees  	 Nonaggressive Stingless Bees

  Answer Choices

                 Nests are regularly distributed
                 Nests are sometimes located together
                 Nests always occur in large clumps
                 Colonies are generally made up of fewer than 100 workers
                 Members of a colony feed alone or in small groups
                 Bees feed mainly on flowers that grow in high density clumps
                 Nest spacing is maintained by fighting
