Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class
Professor
All right  I hope you all had a chance to finish the assigned readings about animal play  because I want to spend some time discussing the different viewpoints presented in those articles  Let s start with the play as preparation hypothesis  Jerry  can you explain it
Male Student
Yeah  Play as preparation  Young animals play in order to get really good at certain specific things they will need to do when they are adults  things like chasing  pouncing  climbing  In other words  they play in order to practice survival skills  like movements used in hunting and fighting  That hypothesis makes a lot of sense  like  maybe the most sense of all the theories we read about
Professor
And what leads you to that conclusion
Male Student
Well  like wolves  the young pups  they fight a lot and bite  you know  not to hurt each other  but     It just seems obvious why those wolf pups play like that  It gives them practice with skills that will make them better hunters or fighters as adults
Female Student
Oh  I don t know about that  I mean  some of the things a young animal does while playing are totally different from the things they ll do as an adult  There was a really good example in the second article  I can t remember what it is called exactly  uh  self â€¦
Professor
Self handicapping
Female Student
Right  Self handicapping  Like during a fake fight  a play fight  if one of the animals is winning  the winning animal might just stop and give up its advantage
Professor
Yes  And often it shifts to a submissive posture too  Of course self handicapping hardly ever happens in a real fight  Because in a real fight  well  the point is to win  So  this self handicapping  it is important to take this into account before just deciding to go with that first explanation  And in fact  there really isn t much in the way of solid experimental evidence to support the play as preparation hypothesis
Female Student
What about the other one  The flexibility hypothesis
Professor
Ah  yes  Let s talk about that  As you say  play is much more than just pretend fighting or practicing other adult behaviors  Apparently  it also contributes to the development of a brain that s flexible  a brain that s quickly able to get a handle on unfamiliar situations  This notion  the flexibility hypothesis  well  many of my colleagues find it quite persuasive
Female Student
So  like with kids  a little kid might play a game with a friend  and then they might race each other across the field  So they are switching from one type of play to another  There s a lot of variety  I mean  they are learning to respond to whatever happens
Professor
Well  that s the general idea  But let s hold off on talking about human behaviors from now  OK  According to the flexibility hypothesis  yes  the diversity  the variety in play can lead to a broader behavioral vocabulary
Male Student
A broader behavioral vocabulary  Can you explain what that means
Professor
Well  sometimes playing results in an animal doing something it would not normally do  That can lead to the animal learning to adapt  to come up with new behaviors that can help it cope with major problems later on  like staying safe or finding food
Female Student
Yeah  And there was that brain study you had us read about too
Professor
Oh  the one on how play affects development within the brain
Female Student
Right  That s it  About the animals raised in an environment where they did not get opportunities to play
Professor
Yes  Wasn t the conclusion interesting  That playing literally stimulates growth  creates connections within the brain  We need to do further studies  but
Female Student
Excuse me  can we go back to play fighting for a minute  I am wondering  can the flexibility hypothesis really explain that
Professor
Play fighting  Actually  that s something the flexibility hypothesis explains very well  Since play fighting includes variations in speed and intensity  and quick role reversals involved with self handicapping  An animal that s play fighting is constantly responding to changes  So it s earning to be flexible
