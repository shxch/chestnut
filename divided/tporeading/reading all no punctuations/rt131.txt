Types of Social Groups
Life places us in a complex web of relationships with other people  Our humanness arises out of these relationships in the course of social interaction  Moreover  our humanness must be sustained through social interaction and fairly constantly so  When an association continues long enough for two people to become linked together by a relatively stable set of expectations  it is called a relationship
People are bound within relationships by two types of bonds  expressive ties and instrumental ties  Expressive ties are social links formed when we emotionally invest ourselves in and commit ourselves to other people  Through association with people who are meaningful to us  we achieve a sense of security  love  acceptance  companionship  and personal worth  Instrumental ties are social links formed when we cooperate with other people to achieve some goal  Occasionally  this may mean working with instead of against competitors  More often  we simply cooperate with others to reach some end without endowing the relationship with any larger significance
Sociologists have built on the distinction between expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish between two types of groups  primary and secondary  A primary group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct  intimate  cohesive relationship with one another  Expressive ties predominate in primary groups  we view the people as ends in themselves and valuable in their own right  A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an impersonal relationship and have come together for a specific  practical purpose  Instrumental ties predominate in secondary groups  we perceive people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right  Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships  This happens in many work settings  People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes  jokes  gossip  and satisfactions
A number of conditions enhance the likelihood that primary groups will arise  First  group size is important  We find it difficult to get to know people personally when they are milling about and dispersed in large groups  In small groups we have a better chance to initiate contact and establish rapport with them  Second  face to face contact allows us to size up others  Seeing and talking with one another in close physical proximity makes possible a subtle exchange of ideas and feelings  And third  the probability that we will develop primary group bonds increases as we have frequent and continuous contact  Our ties with people often deepen as we interact with them across time and gradually evolve interlocking habits and interests
Primary groups are fundamental to us and to society  First  primary groups are critical to the socialization process  Within them  infants and children are introduced to the ways of their society  Such groups are the breeding grounds in which we acquire the norms and values that equip us for social life  Sociologists view primary groups as bridges between individuals and the larger society because they transmit  mediate  and interpret a society s cultural patterns and provide the sense of oneness so critical for social solidarity
Second  primary groups are fundamental because they provide the settings in which we meet most of our personal needs  Within them  we experience companionship  love  security  and an overall sense of well being  Not surprisingly  sociologists find that the strength of a group s primary ties has implications for the group s functioning  For example  the stronger the primary group ties of a sports team playing together  the better their record is
Third  primary groups are fundamental because they serve as powerful instruments for social control  Their members command and dispense many of the rewards that are so vital to us and that make our lives seem worthwhile  Should the use of rewards fail  members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who deviate from the primary group s norms  For instance  some social groups employ shunning  a person can remain in the community  but others are forbidden to interact with the person  as a device to bring into line individuals whose behavior goes beyond that allowed by the particular group  Even more important  primary groups define social reality for us by structuring our experiences  By providing us with definitions of situations  they elicit from our behavior that conforms to group devised meanings  Primary groups  then  serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them
