Trade and the Ancient Middle East
Trade was the mainstay of the urban economy in the Middle East  as caravans negotiated the surrounding desert  restricted only by access to water and by mountain ranges  This has been so since ancient times  partly due to the geology of the area  which is mostly limestone and sandstone  with few deposits of metallic ore and other useful materials Ancient demands for obsidian  a black volcanic rock useful for making mirrors and tools  led to trade with Armenia to the north  while jade for cutting tools was brought from Turkistan  and the precious stone lapis lazuli was imported from Afghanistan  One can trace such expeditions back to ancient Sumeria  the earliest known Middle Eastern civilization  Records show merchant caravans and trading posts set up by the Sumerians in the surrounding mountains and deserts of Persia and Arabia  where they traded grain for raw materials  such as timber and stones  as well as for metals and gems
Reliance on trade had several important consequences  Production was generally in the hands of skilled individual artisans doing piecework under the tutelage of a master who was also the shop owner  In these shops differences of rank were blurred as artisans and masters labored side by side in the same modest establishment  were usually members of the same guild and religious sect  lived in the same neighborhoods  and often had assumed  or real  kinship relationships  The worker was bound to the master by a mutual contract that either one could repudiate  and the relationship was conceptualized as one of partnership
This mode of craft production favored the growth of self governing and ideologically egalitarian craft guilds everywhere in the Middle Eastern city  These were essentially professional associations that provided for the mutual aid and protection of their members  and allowed for the maintenance of professional standards  The growth of independent guilds was furthered by the fact that surplus was not a result of domestic craft production but resulted primarily from international trading  the government left working people to govern themselves  much as shepherds of tribal confederacies were left alone by their leaders  In the multiplicity of small scale local egalitarian or quasi egalitarian organizations for fellowship  worship  and production that flourished in this laissez faire environment  individuals could interact with one another within a community of harmony and ideological equality  following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves by shared consensus while minimizing distinctions of wealth and power
The mercantile economy was also characterized by a peculiar moral stance that is typical of people who live by trade an attitude that is individualistic  calculating  risk taking  and adaptive to circumstances  As among tribespeople  personal relationships and a careful weighing of character have always been crucial in a mercantile economy with little regulation  where one s word is one s bond and where informal ties of trust cement together an international trade network  Nor have merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance for aristocratic professions of moral superiority  favoring instead an egalitarian ethic of the open market  where steady hard work  the loyalty of one s fellows  and   entrepreneurial skill make all the difference  And  like the pastoralists  Middle Eastern merchants and artisans unhappy with their environment could simply pack up and leave for greener pastures an act of self assertion wholly impossible in most other civilizations throughout history
Dependence on long distance trade also meant that the great empires of the Middle East were built both literally and figuratively on shifting sand  The central state  though often very rich and very populous  was intrinsically fragile  since the development of new international trade routes could undermine the monetary base and erode state power  as occurred when European seafarers circumvented Middle Eastern merchants after Vasco da Gama s voyage around Africa in the late fifteenth century opened up a southern route  The ecology of the region also permitted armed predators to prowl the surrounding barrens  which were almost impossible for a state to control  Peripheral peoples therefore had a great advantage in their dealings with the center  making government authority insecure and anxious


    1  According to paragraph 1  why has trade been so important throughout the history of the Middle East
 The rare and valuable metals and stones found in Middle Eastern deserts have always been in high demand in surrounding areas
 Growing conditions throughout the Middle East are generally poor  forcing Middle Eastern people to depend on imported grain
