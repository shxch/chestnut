Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where more snowfalls during a year than melts  Snow falls as hexagonal crystals  but once on the ground  snow is soon transformed into a compacted mass of smaller  rounded grains  As the air space around them is lessened by compaction and melting  the grains become denser  With further melting  refreezing  and increased weight from newer snowfall above  the snow reaches a granular recrystallized stage intermediate between flakes and ice known as firn  With additional time  pressure  and refrozen meltwater from above  the small firn granules become larger  interlocked crystals of blue glacial ice  When the ice is thick enough  usually over 30 meters  the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become plastic and to flow outward or downward from the area of snow accumulation

Glaciers are open systems  with snow as the system s input and meltwater as the system s main output  The glacial system is governed by two basic climatic variables  precipitation and temperature  For a glacier to grow or maintain its mass  there must be sufficient snowfall to match or exceed the annual loss through melting  evaporation  and calving  which occurs when the glacier loses solid chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes  If summer temperatures are high for too long  then all the snowfall from the previous winter will melt  Surplus snowfall is essential for a glacier to develop  A surplus allows snow to accumulate and for the pressure of snow accumulated over the years to transform buried snow into glacial ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow  Glaciers are sometimes classified by temperature as faster flowing temperate glaciers or as slower flowing polar glaciers

Glaciers are part of Earth s hydrologic cycle and are second only to the oceans in the total amount of water contained  About 2 percent of Earth s water is currently frozen as ice  Two percent may be a deceiving figure  however  since over 80 percent of the world s freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers  with the majority of it in Antarctica  The total amount of ice is even more awesome if we estimate the water released upon the hypothetical melting of the world s glaciers  Sea level would rise about 60 meters  This would change the geography of the planet considerably  In contrast  should another ice age occur  sea level would drop drastically  During the last ice age  sea level dropped about 120 meters

When snowfalls on high mountains or in Polar Regions  it may become part of the glacial system  Unlike rain  which returns rapidly to the sea or atmosphere  the snow that becomes part of a glacier is involved in a much more slowly cycling system  Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the liquid water system as meltwater  In the meantime  however  this ice is not static  Glaciers move slowly across the land with tremendous energy  carving into even the hardest rock formations and thereby reshaping the landscape as they engulf  push  drag  and finally deposit rock debris in places far from its original location  As a result  glaciers create a great variety of landforms that remain long after the surface is released from its icy covering

Throughout most of Earth s history  glaciers did not exist  but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth s land surface is covered by glaciers  Present day glaciers are found in Antarctica  in Greenland  and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia  In the recent past  from about 2 4 million to about 10 000 years ago  nearly a third of Earth s land area was periodically covered by ice thousands of meters thick  In the much more distant past  other ice ages have occurred

5  According to paragraph 2  surplus snow affects a glacier in all the following ways EXCEPT
 It provides the pressure needed to cause glacial ice to flow
 It offsets losses of ice due to melting  evaporation  and calving
 It brings about the formation of firn in the snow it buries
 It results in temperate glaciers that are thicker than polar glaciers



6  Paragraph 2 implies that which of the following conditions produces the fastest moving glaciers
 A climate characteristic of the polar regions

11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 As a glacier moves  it leaves behind rock formations that have been engulfed  pushed  and dragged by the glacier
 Glaciers reshape the landscape by carving into rock and transporting the resulting debris to distant locations
 Glaciers carve the hardest rock formations with great energy and slowly reshape them into debris
 The tremendous energy of slowly moving glaciers transports and finally deposits rock debris into large rock formations

12  According to paragraph 5  in what way is the present time unusual in the history of Earth
 There are glaciers
 More land is covered by glaciers than at anytime in the past
 There is no ice age
 No glaciers are found in Australia
13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Firn has the appearance of wet sugar  but it is almost as hard as ice
Where would the sentence best fit
14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Glaciers are part of Earth s hydrologic cycle




Answer Choices

 Glaciers  which at present contain 80 percent of Earth s freshwater  form when accumulated snow is compressed and recrystallized into ice over a period of years
 When there are glaciers on Earth  water is cycled through the glacier system  but the cycle period may be hundreds of thousands of years during periods of ice ages
 The glacial system is governed by precipitation and temperature in such a way that glaciers cannot form in temperate latitudes
 When glacial ice reaches a depth of 30 meters  the weight of the ice causes ice crystals at the bottom to flow  and the resulting movement of the glacier carves the landscape
 If global warming melted the world s glaciers  sea level would rise about 60 meters worldwide
 Glaciers have had little effect on Earth s surface because only 2 percent of Earth s water is currently contained in glaciers  and there are fewer glaciers now than at most times in the past
