When we talk about pollination ecology  we are talking about the relationship between a plant and its pollinator  From the plants  perspective  the ideal pollinator is an animal that is under fed  ready to eat and in a hurry  The pollinator  on the other hand  wants to remain well fed with as little effort as possible  These factors help drive the evolution of plants and their pollinators  both of which depend on this balanced and delicate relationship  Sometimes only certain insects or birds can pollinate certain plant species  So to really understand pollination ecology  both the flower and its pollinators must be studied
Let s start with flowers
There are several important factors associated with pollination  when and how often a plan flowers  how long the flowering cycle lasts  and the number of flowers that open at the same time  For example  flowering may coincide with the migration of a certain animal species that pollinates the plant  or producing many flowers at once may increase the number of pollinators a plant attracts
Other characteristics of flowers are also important  Features such as color  scent and shape attract pollinators  as does the reward in the flower  the pollen or the nectar  that feeds the pollinator  For example  flowers that attract bats tend to be green or cream colored  because visibility is important  Bats are practically blind  remember  And these flowers bloom at night when bats are active
Now  there s a flower in the Amazon rainforest called a royal water lily and the characteristics of its flowers change during the pollination process  The royal water lily uses color  temperature and scent to attract the beetles that pollinate it  When the flowers of the royal water lily first open up  when they first bloom  they are white  They also emit a strong odor and their temperature rises  Producing heat serves two purposes  It magnifies the scent of the flower and it helps the beetles maintain their body temperature  When a beetle arrives at the flower  the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that the beetle becomes covered with pollen  Then when the flower opens  its color changes to red and it cools down  When the beetle flies out  it carries the pollen to a different  heated  white  fragrant flower
As you can see  plants go to a lot of trouble to attract attention  So what kind of attention are they attracting  And why
Well  sometimes flowers provide shelter for insects  a place to lay eggs for instance  But usually the attraction is food  nectar and pollen  Nectar is mainly a sugar solution  while pollen is a grain made up of part of the plant s cell structure   In both nectar and pollen production  quality and quantity vary over time  But they are always related to the needs of the pollinator
You can see that the relationship between pollinators and plants are delicate  so any number of factors can disturb them
Human development is one  And agriculture is generally believed to be the most harmful  It can fragment habitats in a variety of ways  reducing the number of pollinators  which in turn may reduce the number or size of the flowers  which of course affects the animals that feed on them  Exotic plant species not native to the area can move in and compete  Even bees brought in to pollinate crops can alter natural pollen dispersal systems of rainforest plants
On the other hand  recent studies have shown that the disruption of one aspect of the pollination cycle doesn t usually lead to the extinction of other species  It turns out that plant pollinator relationships are more adaptable to change than we thought  So really it is hard to know just how agriculture affects the pollination of plants  ?
