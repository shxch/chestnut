Okay  So  uh  to continue our discussion… When philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge  they don t mean the source of information about any particular subject  They mean how we know what we know

Let s start with one philosophical view foundationalism

Foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims  what we think we know  that is  they need to have a base  And think of knowledge as a house  you need a solid foundation on which to build your house  And if you have a strong foundation  your house is more likely to be solid  Well  foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge  If you have a solid base for your knowledge claims  then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong  valid  true

First  you need some good foundational knowledge claims  and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these  Now  as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational  well  that s where this gets particularly interesting  in fact it sort of depends on which philosopher you ask  Take John Locke for instance

Locke s viewpoint essentially was that when humans are born  their minds are like blank slates  that is  we don t have any kind of knowledge when we are born  We get our knowledge from our senses  you know  taste  touch  smell  sight  hearing  So  when we look at the world  first as babies and then as we grow  that s where our knowledge comes from  Our senses  our experiences serve as the foundation for our knowledge

Now  for a very different view  let s turn to another philosopher René Descartes

Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations  He believed that our senses are not to be trusted  So he wanted to find a more solid foundation for knowledge  He began with what has come to be called methodological doubt  And when we say methodological doubt  well … Descartes believed that everything should be questioned  that is  approach it with doubt and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false  that one thing would serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims

So unlike John Locke  Descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses  He points out that at some time or another  everyone has been deceived by their senses  We have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong illusions  perhaps  mirages  When driving in a car on a hot summer day  you may see what looks like shimmering water on the road  which  as science tells us  is really just a mirage  an illusion caused by the heating of the air  Our senses are wrong  they ve deceived us  And Descartes thinks that since our senses can deceive us  we ought not take for granted that what they tell us is really true  That s the first step in his methodological doubt

From there he wonders  well  ok  I can doubt my senses  but can I doubt that I am sitting in this room  Can it seem that we are not really here  That we are somewhere else  He conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room  But then he says  well  couldn t I just be dreaming  He s had dreams that were so real that he thought he was awake when in fact he was actually asleep  And this is another good point  It s really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming  Yet another proof for Descartes that we can t always trust what our senses are apparently telling us  We could be dreaming  And there s really no good way to prove that we are not

So the common sense picture of reality  that the world is really the way it looks to us  Descartes shows that we cannot just assume this to be true beyond all doubt  And he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming  But consider this  he says  while one is thinking or doubting  or doing any of those sorts of mental activities  one has to exist  right  To even think that I doubt that I exist  you have to exist  And so what Descartes has done is find at least one thing that he can be certain of  He says   I exist   And that s a start  And other knowledge he tells us can be based on that foundation
