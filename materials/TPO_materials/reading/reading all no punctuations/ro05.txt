Aggression
When one animal attacks another  it engages in the most obvious example of aggressive behavior  Psychologists have adopted several approaches to understanding aggressive behavior in people 
The Biological Approach  Numerous biological structures and chemicals appear to be involved in aggression  One is the hypothalamus  a region of the brain  In response to certain stimuli  many animals show instinctive aggressive reactions  The hypothalamus appears to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern  electrical stimulation of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals  In people  however  whose brains are more complex  other brain structures apparently moderate possible instincts 
An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people  Sociobiology views much social behavior  including aggressive behavior  as genetically determined  Consider Darwin s theory of evolution  Darwin held that many more individuals are produced than can find food and survive into adulthood  A struggle for survival follows  Those individuals who possess characteristics that provide them with an advantage in the struggle for existence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next generation  In many species  such characteristics include aggressiveness  Because aggressive individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce  whatever genes are linked to aggressive behavior are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generations 
The sociobiology view has been attacked on numerous grounds  One is that people s capacity to outwit other species  not their aggressiveness  appears to be the dominant factor in human survival  Another is that there is too much variation among people to believe that they are dominated by  or at the mercy of  aggressive impulses 
The Psychodynamic Approach  Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior  including aggression  Sigmund Freud  for example  believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable reactions to the frustrations of daily life  Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people  including their parents  because even the most attentive parents cannot gratify all of their demands immediately  Yet children  also fearing their parents  punishment and the loss of parental love  come to repress most aggressive impulses  The Freudian perspective  in a sense  sees us as  steam engines   By holding in rather than venting  steam   we set the stage for future explosions  Pent up aggressive impulses demand outlets  They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture  or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life 
According to psychodynamic theory  the best ways to prevent harmful aggression may be to encourage less harmful aggression  In the steam engine analogy  verbal aggression may vent some of the aggressive steam  So might cheering on one s favorite sports team  Psychoanalysts  therapists adopting a psychodynamic approach  refer to the venting of aggressive impulses as  catharsis   Catharsis is theorized to be a safety valve  But research findings on the usefulness of catharsis are mixed  Some studies suggest that catharsis leads to reductions in tension and a lowered likelihood of future aggression  Other studies  however  suggest that letting some steam escape actually encourages more aggression later on 
The Cognitive Approach  Cognitive psychologists assert that our behavior is influenced by our values  by the ways in which we interpret our situations and by choice  For example  people who believe that aggression is necessary and justified as during wartime are likely to act aggressively  whereas people who believe that a particular war or act of aggression is unjust  or who think that aggression is never justified  are less likely to behave aggressively 
One cognitive theory suggests that aggravating and painful events trigger unpleasant feelings  These feelings  in turn  can lead to aggressive action  but not automatically  Cognitive factors intervene  People decide whether they will act aggressively or not on the basis of factors such as their experiences with aggression and their interpretation of other people s motives  Supporting evidence comes from research showing that aggressive people often distort other people s motives  For example  they assume that other people mean them harm when they do not 
Catharsis  In psychodynamic theory  the purging of strong emotions or the relieving of tensions 



1  According to paragraph 2  what evidence indicates that aggression in animals is related to the hypothalamus  
 Some aggressive animal species have a highly developed hypothalamus  
 Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus delays animals  inborn reaction patterns 
 Animals behaving aggressively show increased activity in the hypothalamus 
 Animals who lack a hypothalamus display few aggressive tendencies 






2  According to Darwin s theory of evolution  members of a species are forced to struggle for survival because
 not all individuals are skilled in finding food
 individuals try to defend their young against attackers
 many more individuals are born than can survive until the age of reproduction
 individuals with certain genes are more likely to reach adulthood

6  According to paragraph 5  Freud believed that children experience conflict between a desire to vent aggression on their parents and  
 a frustration that their parents do not give them everything they want
 a fear that their parents will punish them and stop loving them

7  Freud describes people as  steam engines  in order to make the point that people  
 deliberately build up their aggression to make themselves stronger
 usually release aggression in explosive ways
 must vent their aggression to prevent it from building up
 typically lose their aggression if they do not express it
