Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class

Professor
In any introductory course  I think it s always a good idea to step back and ask our selves  What are we studying in this class  and why are we studying it
So  for example  when you looked at the title of this course in the catalog  Introduction to World History  what did you think you were getting into       what made you sign up for it  besides filling the social science requirement
Anyone

Male student
Well       just the the history of everything       you know  starting at the beginning       with       I guess  the Greeks and Romans       the Middle Ages  the Renaissance       you know  that kinda stuff       like what we did in high school
Professor
OK       Now  what you re describing is one approach to world history

In fact  there are several approaches basic  models  or  conceptual frameworks  of what we study when we  do  history  And what you studied in high school what I call the  Western Heritage Model   this used to be the most common approach in U S  high schools and colleges       in fact  it s the model I learned with  when I was growing up back oh  about a hundred years ago
Uh       at Middletown High School  up in Maine      l guess it made sense to my teachers back then since  well  the history of western Europe was the cultural heritage of everyone in my class       and this remained the dominant approach in most U S  schools till       oh  maybe       30  40 years ago       But it doesn t take more than a quick look around campus even just this classroom today to see that the student body in the U S  is much more diverse than my little class in Middletown High       and this Western Heritage Model was eventually replaced by or sometimes combined with one or more of the newer approaches       and I wanna take a minute to describe these to you today  so you can see where this course fits in
OK       so       up until the mid twentieth century  the basic purpose of most world history courses was to learn about a set of values       institutions       ideas       which were considered the  heritage  of the people of Europe things like       democracy       legal systems       types of social organization       artistic achievements
Now  as I said  this model gives us a rather limited view of history  So  in the 1960s and 70s it was combined with or replaced by what I call the  Different Cultures Model   The  60s were a period in which people were demanding more relevance in the curriculum  and there was criticism of the European focus that you were likely to find in all the academic disciplines  For the most part  the Different Cultures Model didn t challenge the basic assumptions of the Western Heritage Model  What it did was insist on representing other civilizations and cultural categories  in addition to those of western Europe
In other words  the heritage of all people  not just what goes back to the Greeks and Romans  but also the origins of African       Asian       Native American civilizations  Though more inclusive  it s still  basically  a  heritage model        which brings us to a third approach  what I call the  Patterns of Change Model
Like the Different Cultures Model  this model presents a wide cultural perspective  But  with this model  we re no longer limited by notions of fixed cultural or geo graphical boundaries  So  then  studying world history is not so much a question of how a particular nation or ethnic group developed  but rather it s a look at common themes conflicts       trends that cut across modern day borders of nations or ethnic groups  In my opinion  this is the best way of studying history  to better understand current day trends and conflicts
For example  let s take the study of the Islamic world  Well  when I first learned about Islamic civilization  it was from the perspective of Europeans  Now  with the Patterns of Change Model  we re looking at the past through a wider lens  So we would be more interested  say  in how interactions with Islamic civilization the religion       art       literature affected cultures in Africa       India       Spain       and so on
Or       let s take another example  Instead of looking at each cultural group as having a separate  linear development from some ancient origin  in this course we ll be looking for the common themes that go beyond cultural or regional distinctions  So       instead of studying       a particular succession of British kings       or a dynasty of Chinese emperors       in this course  we ll be looking at the broader concepts of monarchy  imperialism       and political transformation
