TPO 9 Lecture 2 Environmental Science

Listen to a part of lecture in an environmental science class

Lecturer  So since we re on the topic of global climate change and its effects  in Alaska  in the northern Arctic part of Alaska  over the last     oh    thirty years or so  temperatures have increased about half a degree Celsius per decade  and scientists have noticed that there s been a change in surface vegetation during this time  Shrubs are increasing in the  tundra

Tundra is flat land with very little vegetation  Just a few species of plants grow there because the temperature is very cold  and there s not much precipitation  And because of the cold temperatures  the tundra has two layers  top layer  which is called the active layer  is frozen in the winter and spring  but thaws in the summer  Beneath this active layer is a second layer called  permafrost   which is frozen all year around  and is impermeable to water

Female Student  So because of the permafrost  none of the plants that grow there can have deep roots  can they

Lecturer  No  and that s one of the reasons that shrubs survive in the Arctic  Shrubs are little bushes  They re not tall and being low to the ground protects them from the cold and wind  And their roots don t grow very deep  so the permafrost doesn t interfere with their growth  OK

Now since the temperatures have been increasing in Arctic Alaska  the growth of shrubs has increased  And this has presented climate scientists with a puzzle

Male Student  I m sorry  when you say the growth of shrubs has increased  do you mean that the shrubs are bigger  or that there are more shrubs

Lecturer  Good question  And the answer is both  The size of the shrubs has increased and shrub cover has spread to what was previously shrub free tundra  Ok  so what s the puzzle  Warmer temperatures should lead to increased vegetation growth  right  Well  the connection is not so simple  The temperature increase has occurred during the winter and spring  not during the summer  But the increase in shrubs has occurred in the summer  So how can increase temperatures in the winter and spring result in increased shrub growth in the summer

Well  it may be biological processes that occur in the soil in the winter  that cause increased shrub growth in the summer  and here s how  there are  microbes   microscopic organisms that live in the soil  These microbes enable the soil to have more nitrogen  which plants need to live and they remain quite active during the winter  There re two reasons for this  first  they live in the active layer  which  remember  contains water that doesn t penetrate the permafrost  Second  most of the precipitation in the Arctic is in the form of snow  And the snow  which blankets the ground in the winter  actually has an insulating effect on the soil beneath it  And it allows the temperature of the soil to remain warm enough for microbes to remain active  So there s been increased nutrient production in the winter  And that s what s responsible for the growth of shrubs in the summer and their spread to new areas of the tundra  Areas with more new nutrients are the areas with the largest increase in shrubs

Female student  But  what about run off in the spring  when the snow finally melts  Won t the nutrients get washed away  Spring thaw always washes away soil  doesn t it

Lecturer  Well  much of the soil is usually still frozen during peak run off  And the nutrients are deep down in the active layer anyway  not high up near the surface  which is the part of the active layer most affected by run off

But as I was about to say  there s more to the story  The tundra is windy  and the snow is blown across the tundra  it s caught by shrubs  And deep snow drifts often form around shrubs  And we ve already mentioned the insulating effect of snow  So that extra warmth means even more microbial activity  which means even more food for the shrubs  which means even more shrubs and more snow around etc   It s a circle  a loop  And because of this loop  which is promoted by warmer temperatures in winter and spring  well  it looks like the tundra may be turning into shrub land

Female student  But will it be long term  I mean maybe the shrubs will be abundant for a few years  and then it ll change back to tundra

Lecturer  Well  shrub expansion has occurred in other environments  like semiarid grassland  and tall grass prairies  And shrub expansion in these environments does seem to persist  almost to the point of causing a shift  Once is established  shrub land thrives  particularly in the Arctic  because Arctic shrubs are good at taking advantage of increased nutrients in the soil  better than other Arctic plants
