Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his music history professor

Student
Um  professor Jenkins  The listening journal you assigned us to keep for the Intro to World Music class  well  I am not sure I understand what to do  I listened to the pieces you assigned this week more than once  but when I tried to write about them  I didn t know what to say

Professor
Well  it s not easy to write about music  even for people who are supposedly expert at it

Student
That makes me feel a little better  But I am just not familiar with how you keep a listening journal  I ve kept journals for other classes  summarizing and writing about how I felt about readings

Professor
Well  a listening journal isn t all that different  I want you to note your feelings about musical compositions too

Student
OK  There were pieces I like more than others  but I think you want our comments to be a little more…I don t know  analytical  Right

Professor
Well  whether you like a piece or not is important  but you should be able to explain why you like a particular piece and be able to talk about its historical and musical context  Actually  the listening journal is a tool to help you listen to music actively  to think about what you are hearing

Student
Maybe I am finding it difficult because I am not real familiar with most of the music you assigned  I mean  if it s hip hop or something I listen to with my friends…

Professor
Yes  because hip hop is a form that s familiar and meaningful to you  But you ll see as the semester progresses and you start learning more about musical forms  you ll become a more adept listener  And you ll start noticing patterns

Student
OK  So the songs we listened to this week  the …the Canto

Professor
The Cante jondo  You remember we said it means  deep song  in Andalusian Spanish  Not only because it s sung in a deep register  but also because it s a song about deeper or serious matters  certainly not lighthearted

Student
Really  Hmm…I guess I didn t catch the double meaning  That s kind of cool  But anyway  even with the translations you gave us for the lyrics and everything  I don t know  I could tell it s sad  but I wasn t trying to analyze it  from a musical perspective that is

Professor
OK  So this is what you should do  Go back and listen to the song selection and this time pay attention to the melody  to repetition  to the …

Student
There was plenty of that  Some parts sounded like the same note played over and over again

Professor
That s exactly the kind of observation you would record in a listening journal  So  melody repetition  rhythm  how the piece is structured  as well as your reasons for liking or disliking it

You know what  I thought everyone was clear about this  but you ve just given me a great idea  I am going to draw up a list of questions everyone should keep in mind when they are writing their journals  Other students may be having the same problem you are having  Lecture3 Archaeology Clovis Culture
