All right  so now we ve talked about folk legends and seen that their     one of their key features is there s usually some real history behind them  They are often about real people  so you can identify with the characters  and that s what engages us in them  The particular stories might not be true and some of the characters or events might be made up  But there s still a sense that the story could have been true since it is about a real person  That s distinct contrast from the other main branch of popular storytelling  which is folk tales

Folk tales are imaginative stories that     um     like folk legends  they have been passed down orally  from storyteller to storyteller for     since ancient times  But with folk tales you don t ever really get the sense that the story might have been true  They are purely imaginative and so quite revealing  I think anyway  about the culture and the connection between folk tales and culture  which we ll talk about

But first let s go over the various types of folk tale and focus specifically on Norwegian folk tales since they illustrate the variety pretty well  There are in general three main types of Norwegian folk tales

One is animal stories  where animals are the main characters  They can be wild animals or domestic  and a lot of times they can talk and behave like humans  but at the same time  they retain their animal characteristics too  They tend to involve animals like bears  wolves and foxes  The point of these stories  their  their internal objectives  so the speak  is usually to explain some feature of the animal  how it arose  So there s one about a fox who fools a bear into going ice fishing with his tail  When the bear puts his tail into the water through a hole in the ice  to try and catch a fish  the ice freezes around it  and he ends up pulling his tail off  So that s why bears to this day have such short tails

The second category of Norwegian folk tale is the supernatural  Eh     stories about giants and dragons and trolls  and humans with supernatural powers or gifts  like invisibility cloaks  Or where people are turned into animals and back again into a person  those are called transformation stories

There s a well known Norwegian supernatural folk tale  a transformation story called East of the Sun and West of the Moon  which we ll read  It involves a prince who is a white bear by night and a human by day  And he lives in the castle that s east of the Sun and west of the Moon  which the heroine in the story has to try to find  Besides being a good example of a transformation story  this one also has a lot of the common things that tend to show up in folk tales  You will find the standard opening   once upon a time         And it has stock characters like a prince  and a poor but beautiful peasant girl  she is the heroine I mentioned  And     um     it has a very conventional form  So no more than two characters are involved in any one scene  And it has a happy ending  And it s     the story is presented as though     well  even though a lot of the actions that occurred are pretty fantastic  so you d never think of it as realistic  The characters still act like     they resemble real people  They are not real or even based on historical figures  But you might have a supernatural story involving a king  and he d act like you d expect a Norwegian king to act

OK  The third main kind of folk tale is the comical story  We ll say more later about these  but for now  just be aware of the category and that they can contain supernatural aspects  but they are usually more playful and amusing overall than supernatural stories

Now  as I said  traditionally  folk tales were just passed down orally  Each generation of storytellers had their own style of telling a story  But     um     in Norway  before the 19th century  folk tales were just for kids  They weren t seen as worthy of analysis or academic attention  But this changed when the romantic movement spread throughout Europe in the mid 19th century  Romantics looked at folk tales as sort of a reflection of the soul of the people  So there was something distinctly Norwegian in folk tales from Norway  And there was renewed pride in the literature and art forms of individual countries  As a result  the first collection of Norwegian folk tales is published in 1852  And there have been many new editions published since then  For the people of Norway  these stories are now an important part of what it means to be Norwegian
