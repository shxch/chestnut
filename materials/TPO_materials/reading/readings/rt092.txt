Teachers  it is thought  benefit from the practice of reflection  the conscious act of thinking deeply about and carefully examining the interactions and events within their own classrooms  Educators T  Wildman and J  Niles  1987  describe a scheme for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers  This was justified by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity of scientific fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the discipline of teaching
Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which reflection might flourish–a subject on which there is little guidance in the literature  They designed an experimental strategy for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years  They were concerned that many would be  drawn to these new  refreshing  conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher reflection is too great to bridge  Reflection on a complex task such as teaching is not easy   The teachers were taken through a program of talking about teaching events  moving on to reflecting about specific issues in a supported  and later an independent  manner
Wildman and Niles observed that systematic reflection on teaching required a sound ability to understand classroom events in an objective manner  They describe the initial understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being  utilitarian …and not rich or detailed enough to drive systematic reflection   Teachers rarely have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an objective manner  Further observation revealed the tendency of teachers to evaluate events rather than review the contributory factors in a considered manner by  in effect  standing outside the situation
Helping this group of teachers to revise their thinking about classroom events became central  This process took time and patience and effective trainers  The researchers estimate that the initial training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours  with the same number of hours again being required to practice the skills of reflection
Wildman and Niles identify three principles that facilitate reflective practice in a teaching situation  The first is support from administrators in an education system  enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students  The second is the availability of sufficient time and space  The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the immediate demands of others in order to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills  The third is the development of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers  Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their professional life with which they were not comfortable  Wildman and Niles make a summary comment   Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher as reflective practitioner will not happen simply because it is a good or even compelling idea
The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice  Others have noted this  making a similar point about the teaching profession s cultural inhibitions about reflective practice  Zeichner and Liston  1987  point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a  reflective  professional decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician  putting into practice the ideas of theirs  More basic than the cultural issues is the matter of motivation  Becoming a reflective practitioner requires extra work  Jaworski  1993  and has only vaguely defined goals with  perhaps  little initially perceivable reward and the threat of vulnerability  Few have directly questioned what might lead a teacher to want to become reflective  Apparently  the most obvious reason for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing  There appear to be many unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect –for example  the value of externally motivated reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might reflect by habit

2  According to paragraph 1  it was believed that reflection could help teachers
 understand intellectual principles of teaching
 strengthen their intellectual connection to their work
 use scientific fact to improve discipline and teaching
 adopt a more disciplined approach to teaching


3  The word  flourish  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 continue
 occur
 succeed

4  All of the following are mentioned about the experimental strategy described in paragraph 2 EXCEPT
 It was designed so that teachers would eventually reflect without help from others
 It was used by a group of teachers over a period of years
 It involved having teachers take part in discussions of classroom events
 It involved having teachers record in writing their reflections about teaching

5  According to paragraph 2  Wildman and Niles worried that the teachers they were working with might feel that
 the number of teachers involved in their program was too large
 the concepts of teacher reflection were so abstract that they could not be applied
 the ideas involved in reflection were actually not new and refreshing
 several years would be needed to acquire the habit of reflecting on their teaching


6  The word  objective  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unbiased
 positive
 systematic
 thorough
7  According to paragraph 3  what did the teachers working with Wildman and Niles often fail to do when they attempted to practice reflection
 Correctly calculate the amount of time needed for reflection
 Provide sufficiently detailed descriptions of the methods they used to help them reflect
 Examine thoughtfully the possible causes of events in their classrooms
 Establish realistic goals for themselves in practicing reflection

8  How is paragraph 4 related to other aspects of the discussion of reflection in the passage
 It describes and comments on steps taken to overcome problems identified earlier in the passage
 It challenges the earlier claim that teachers rarely have the time to think about their own or others  teaching
 It identifies advantages gained by teachers who followed the training program described earlier in the passage
 It explains the process used to define the principles discussed later in the passage


9  The word  compelling  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 commonly held
 persuasive
 original
 practical

10  According to paragraph 6  teachers may be discouraged from reflecting because
 it is not generally supported by teacher educators
 the benefits of reflection may not be apparent immediately
 it is impossible to teach and reflect on one s teaching at the same time
 they have often failed in their attempts to become reflective practitioners

11  Which of the sentences below expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The practice of being reflective is no longer simply a habit among teachers but something that is externally motivated
 Most teachers need to explore ways to form the habit of reflection even when no external motivation exists
 Many aspects of the motivation to reflect have not been studied  including the comparative benefits of externally motivated and habitual reflection among teachers
 There has not been enough exploration of why teachers practice reflection as a habit with or without external motivation


12  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
However  changing teachers  thinking about reflection will not succeed unless there is support for reflection in the teaching environment

Wildman and Niles have conducted research on reflection in teaching





Answer Choices

 Through their work with Virginia teachers  Wildman and Niles proved conclusively that reflection  though difficult  benefits both teachers and students
 Wildman and Niles found that considerable training and practice are required to understand classroom events and develop the skills involved in reflection
 Wildman and Niles identified three principles that teachers can use to help themselves cope with problems that may arise as a result of reflection
 Wildman and Niles concluded that teachers need sufficient resources as well as the cooperation and encouragement of others to practice reflection
 There are numerous obstacles to implementing reflection in schools and insufficient understanding of why teachers might want to reflect
 Whether teachers can overcome the difficulties involved in reflection may depend on the nature and intensity of their motivation to reflect
