Savanna Formation
Located in tropical areas at low altitudes  savannas are stable ecosystems  some wet and some dry consisting of vast grasslands with scattered trees or shrubs  They occur on a wide range of soil types and in extremes of climate  There is no simple or single factor that determines if a given site will be a savanna  but some factors seem to play important roles in their formation

Savannas typically experience a rather prolonged dry season  One theory behind savanna formation is that wet forest species are unable to withstand the dry season  and thus savanna  rather than rain forest  is favored on the site  Savannas experience an annual rainfall of between 1 000 and 2 000 millimeters  most of it falling in a five  to eight month wet season  Though plenty of rain may fall on a savanna during the year  for at least part of the year little does  creating the drought stress ultimately favoring grasses  Such conditions prevail throughout much of northern South America and Cuba  but many Central American savannas as well as coastal areas of Brazil and the island of Trinidad do not fit this pattern  In these areas  rainfall per month exceeds that in the above definition  so other factors must contribute to savanna formation

In many characteristics  savanna soils are similar to those of some rain forests  though more extreme  For example  savanna soils  like many rain forest soils  are typically oxisols  dominated by certain oxide minerals  and ultisols  soils containing no calcium carbonate   with a high acidity and notably low concentrations of such minerals as phosphorus  calcium  magnesium  and potassium  while aluminum levels are high  Some savannas occur on wet  waterlogged soils  others on dry  sandy  well drained soils  This may seem contradictory  but it only means that extreme soil conditions  either too wet or too dry for forests  are satisfactory for savannas  More moderate conditions support moist forests

Waterlogged soils occur in areas that are flat or have poor drainage  These soils usually contain large amounts of clay and easily become water saturated  Air cannot penetrate between the soil particles  making the soil oxygen poor  By contrast  dry soils are sandy and porous  their coarse textures permitting water to drain rapidly  Sandy soils are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals and so tend to be nutritionally poor  Though most savannas are found on sites with poor soils  because of either moisture conditions or nutrient levels of both   poor soils can and do support lush rain forest

Most savannas probably experience mild fires frequently and major burns every two years or so  Many savanna and dry forest plant species are called pyrophytes  meaning they are adapted in various ways to withstand occasional burning  Frequent fire is a factor to which rain forest species seem unable to adapt  although ancient charcoal remains from Amazon forest soils dating prior to the arrival of humans suggest that moist forests also occasionally burn  Experiments suggest that if fire did not occur in savannas in the Americas  species composition would change significantly  When burning occurs  it prevents competition among plant species from progressing to the point where some species exclude others  reducing the overall diversity of the ecosystem  But in experimental areas protected from fire  a few perennial grass species eventually come to dominate  outcompeting all others  Evidence from other studies suggests that exclusion of fire results in markedly decreased plant species richness  often with an increase in tree density  There is generally little doubt that fire is a significant factor in maintaining savanna  certainly in most regions

On certain sites  particularly in South America  savanna formation seems related to frequent cutting and burning of moist forests for pastureland  Increase in pastureland and subsequent overgrazing have resulted in an expansion of savanna  The thin upper layer of humus  decayed organic matter  is destroyed by cutting and burning  Humus is necessary for rapid decomposition of leaves by bacteria and fungi and for recycling by surface roots  Once the humus layer disappears  nutrients cannot be recycled and leach from the soil  converting soil from fertile to infertile and making it suitable only for savanna vegetation  Forests on white  sandy soil are most susceptible to permanent alteration



1  The word  prolonged  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 predictable
 destructive
 lengthy
 unproductive


2  In paragraph 2  the author mentions savannas in Central America  Brazil  and the island of Trinidad in order to
 argue that these savannas are similar to those in South America and Cuba
 point out exceptions to the pattern of savanna formation in areas with drought stress
 provide additional examples of savannas in areas with five to eight month wet seasons
 indicate areas where savannas are being gradually replaced by rain forests






3  According to paragraph 3  rain forests and savannas differ in that
 the soils in rain forests contain fewer minerals than savanna soils do
 savannas affect soil conditions more than rain forests do
 unlike rain forests  savannas prefer sandy  well drained soils to solids that are very wet
 unlike rain forests  savannas may develop under both very dry and very wet soil conditions

4  The word  notably  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 similarly
 especially
 usually
 relatively

5  According to paragraph 3  all of the following are true of savanna soils EXCEPT
 They have high concentrations of potassium
 They contain high levels of aluminum
 They are very acidic
 They contain large amounts of certain oxide minerals

6  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of waterlogged soils
 Their upper layers are usually sandy and porous
 They cannot support savannas
 They contain little oxygen
 They are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals


7  The fact that  poor soils can and do support lush rain forest  suggests that
 poor soils alone may not be enough to explain why an area becomes a savanna
 rain forest vegetation can significantly lower the quality of soils
 drought stress is the single most important factor in savanna formation
 minerals are more important than moisture for the growth of trees


8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Rain forest species seem unable to adapt to fires created by humans
 Ancient charcoal remains suggest that  prior to the arrival of humans  fires occurred frequently in rain forests
 Ancient charcoal remains in Amazon forests suggest that rain forest species adapted to the area long before the arrival of humans
 Rain forest species appear unable to adapt to frequent fires  but evidence from the past suggests that rain forests sometimes do burn

9  The word  markedly  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 dangerously
 noticeably
 rapidly
 gradually

10  Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements regarding the importance of fires in maintaining savannas
 Fires prevent the growth of pyrophytes
 Fires eliminate some species and thus reduce the overall diversity of the ecosystem
 Fires that occur once every two years are unlikely to help maintain savannas
 Fires prevent some species from eliminating other species with which they compete








11  The word  subsequent  in the passage is closest in meaning to

 repeated

12  According to paragraph 6  human activity affects soils in all of the following ways EXCEPT
 Decomposition of leaves occurs too fast for surface roots to obtain nutrients
 Nutrients are not recycled
 Humus is destroyed
 certain soils become unable to support vegetation other than savanna vegetation

Several factors seem to play important roles in savanna formation







Answer Choices

 	Savannas can form in areas with a five to eight month wet season  but they more commonly have a longer wet season
 	Soil stress caused by drought  extreme moisture  or low nutrient levels favors the formation of savannas
 	Studies conducted in various regions indicate that an upper layer of white  sandy  soil is present in most permanent savannas
 	Drought stress affects trees and shrubs in savannas far less than it affects savanna grasses
 	Frequent fire is a major factor contributing to the formation and maintenance of savannas
 	In some areas  human cutting and burning is associated with savanna formation  and increase in pastureland had led to savanna expansion
