TPO 1 Lecture 4 Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor
For today s discussion  we ll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments  Now you had to read about two animal species  the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot  Marmots are rodents  They are large ground squirrels  about the size of an average house cat  And they live in a variety of habitats  And even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating  according to this case study  marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies  Why is that

Student
Well  when they are not hibernating  you can find them in open areas  And they are pretty active during the day  which makes them easy to observe  right

Professor
Uh huh  so first let s discuss the Eastern marmots  They reside throughout the eastern region of North America where there is a temperate climate  where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year  which is when they do all their mating  playing and eating

Student
Oh  I see  At first I wasn t sure what growing season meant  just from the reading  But now I get it  It s the amount of time it takes for them to grow  right  So it would be five months

Professor
Umm  Oh  uhâ€¦ I m sorry but no  It has nothing to do with that  It s not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to grow  It s when the food is available  That is when it s not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and  umm  vegetative parts of a plant s herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat  So growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat  OK  So now how would you describe the Eastern marmots  social habits

Student
Well  they are really territorial  and loners  and just so aggressive even with other Eastern marmots  And their mating ritual is just so impersonal

Professor
Uh huh  Now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation  the mating process begins  For them  well  they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways  Then about six to eight weeks after birth  the offspring leave their mothers

Student
Really  Just six weeks  Is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young

Professor
Well  it s not as if they aren t ready for the real world because they are  Remember  they mature quickly and the weather s nice  Also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation  So roughly six weeks after birth  Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment  So how does this relate to their behavior

Student
Oh  I get it  Since the climate s not too bad  the Eastern marmots don t have to rely on each other too much and they really don t need to stay together as a family to survive either

Professor
Uh ha  Any contrast  the Olympic marmots  What about them
Student
Well  they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old  They re really friendly with each other  And what I really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies  And they are not at all aggressive and territorial like the Eastern marmots  So their social behavior is so different from Eastern marmots because of the climate where they live  That seems so bizarre

Professor
Well  the Olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher  So there is a lot more wind and snow  The growing season only lasts about two to three months  So in that much shorter period of time  all the Olympic marmots  male and female  eat  play  work and nurture the young together  Because the climate is so harsh  cooperation increases the survival rate of the Olympic marmots  They keep their young at home until they are physically able to survive on their own  This could explain why the social behavior of the Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Eastern marmots
