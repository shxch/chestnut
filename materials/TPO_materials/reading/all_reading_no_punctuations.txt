 Applied Arts and Fine Arts

Although we now tend to refer to the various crafts according to the materials used to construct them clay  glass  wood  fiber  and metal it was once common to think of crafts in terms of function  which led to their being known as the  applied arts   Approaching crafts from the point of view of function  we can divide them into simple categories  containers  shelters and supports  There is no way around the fact that containers  shelters  and supports must be functional  The applied arts are thus bound by the laws of physics  which pertain to both the materials used in their making and the substances and things to be contained  supported  and sheltered  These laws are universal in their application  regardless of cultural beliefs  geography  or climate  If a pot has no bottom or has large openings in its sides  it could hardly be considered a container in any traditional sense  Since the laws of physics  not some arbitrary decision  have determined the general form of applied art objects  they follow basic patterns  so much so that functional forms can vary only within certain limits  Buildings without roofs  for example  are unusual because they depart from the norm  However  not all functional objects are exactly alike  that is why we recognize a Shang Dynasty vase as being different from an Inca vase  What varies is not the basic form but the incidental details that do not obstruct the object s primary function  

Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the maker of applied art objects  It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the maker of fine art objects  This assumption misses a significant difference between the two disciplines  Fine art objects are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied art objects are  Because their primary purpose is not functional  they are only limited in terms of the materials used to make them  Sculptures must  for example  be stable  which requires an understanding of the properties of mass  weight distribution  and stress  Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the canvas will be taut  and the paint must not deteriorate  crack  or discolor  These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work  For example  in the early Italian Renaissance  bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof  This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg  In other words  the demands of the laws of physics  not the sculptor s aesthetic intentions  placed the ball there  That this device was a necessary structural compromise is clear from the fact that the cannonball quickly disappeared when sculptors learned how to strengthen the internal structure of a statue with iron braces  iron being much stronger than bronze   

Even though the fine arts in the twentieth century often treat materials in new ways  the basic difference in attitude of artists in relation to their materials in the fine arts and the applied arts remains relatively constant  It would therefore not be too great an exaggeration to say that practitioners of the fine arts work to overcome the limitations of their materials  whereas those engaged in the applied arts work in concert with their materials

2  Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence  Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 

 Functional applied art objects cannot vary much from the basic patterns determined by the laws of physics  
 The function of applied art objects is determined by basic patterns in the laws of physics  
 Since functional applied art objects vary only within certain limits  arbitrary decisions cannot have determined their general form  
 The general form of applied art objects is limited by some arbitrary decision that is not determined by the laws of physics  

















  3  According to paragraph 2  sculptors in the Italian Renaissance stopped using cannonballs in bronze statues of horses because 
 they began using a material that made the statues weigh less 
 they found a way to strengthen the statues internally 
 the aesthetic tastes of the public had changed over time 
 the cannonballs added too much weight to the statues 
4  Why does the author discuss the bronze statues of horses created by artists in the early Italian Renaissance 
 To provide an example of a problem related to the laws of physics that a fine artist must overcome
 To argue that fine artists are unconcerned with the laws of physics
 To contrast the relative sophistication of modern artists in solving problems related to the laws of physics
 To note an exceptional piece of art constructed without the aid of technology

Answer Choices

 Applied art objects fulfill functions  such as containing or sheltering  and objects with the same function have similar characteristics because they are constrained by their purpose 
 It is easy to recognize that Shang Dynasty vases are different from Inca vases 
 Fine art objects are not functional  so they are limited only by the properties of the materials used 
 Renaissance sculptors learned to use iron braces to strengthen the internal structures of bronze statues 
 In the twentieth century  fine artists and applied artists became more similar to one another in their attitudes toward their materials 
 In all periods  fine artists tend to challenge the physical limitations of their materials while applied artists tend to cooperate with the physical properties of their materials

The Origins of Cetaceans

It should be obvious that cetaceans whales  porpoises  and dolphins are mammals  They breathe through lungs  not through gills  and give birth to live young  Their streamlined bodies  the absence of hind legs  and the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals  However  unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds  seals  sea lions  and walruses  whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea   it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like  Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record  How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged  Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate  or transitional  between land mammals and cetaceans 
Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans  In 1979  a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale  The fossil was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made  Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old  The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea 

The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte  an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans  Although limited to a skull  the Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the origins of cetaceans  The skull is cetacean like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales  Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals  The skull also lacks a blowhole  another cetacean adaptation for diving  Other features  however  show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh eating mammals  the mesonychids  and cetaceans  It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean  It probably bred and gave birth on land 

Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989  Several skeletons of another early whale  Basilosaurus  were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert  This whale lived around 40 million years ago  12 million years after Pakicetus  Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included  for the first time in an archaeocyte  a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes  Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50 foot long Basilosaurus on land  Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional  or vestigial  hind legs 

An even more exciting find was reported in 1994  also from Pakistan  The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans   the walking whale that swam   lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago  It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus  The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs  The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped  The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea  The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke  the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans  The structure of the backbone shows  however  that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down  even though a fluke was missing  The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water  On land  where it probably bred and gave birth  Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion  It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea

 Fossil legs of early whales are a rare find 
 The legs provided important information about the evolution of cetaceans 
 The discovery allowed scientists to reconstruct a complete skeleton of the whale 
 Until that time  only the front legs of early whales had been discovered

Desert Formation

The deserts  which already occupy approximately a fourth of the Earth s land surface  have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace  The expansion of desert like conditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification  It has been estimated that an additional one fourth of the Earth s land surface is threatened by this process  

Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water  In some cases the loose soil is blown completely away  leaving a stony surface  In other cases  the finer particles may be removed  while the sand sized particles are accumulated to form mobile hills or ridges of sand  

Even in the areas that retain a soil cover  the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of the soil s ability to absorb substantial quantities of water  The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil spaces  sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration  Water absorption is greatly reduced  consequently runoff is increased  resulting in accelerated erosion rates  The gradual drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation  so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is established  

In some regions  the increase in desert areas is occurring largely as the result of a trend toward drier climatic conditions  Continued gradual global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years  The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases  

There is little doubt  however  that desertification in most areas results primarily from human activities rather than natural processes  The semiarid lands bordering the deserts exist in a delicate ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures  Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel  In wet periods  the land may be able to respond to these stresses  During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins  though  the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its diminished capacity  and desertification results  

Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes  overcultivation  overgrazing  firewood gathering  and overirrigation  The cultivation of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as population densities have grown  These regions are especially likely to have periods of severe dryness  so that crop failures are common  Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation  crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion  

The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands  where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation  The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil  This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion  


Firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and heating in many countries  The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the removal of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs  The increasing use of dried animal waste as a substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because this valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land  

The final major human cause of desertification is soil salinization resulting from overirrigation  Excess water from irrigation sinks down into the water table  If no drainage system exists  the water table rises  bringing dissolved salts to the surface  The water evaporates and the salts are left behind  creating a white crustal layer that prevents air and water from reaching the underlying soil  

The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected  as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process  Once the soil has been removed by erosion  only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form  In areas where considerable soil still remains  though  a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface

Many factors have contributed to the great increase in desertification in recent decades  
 
 	
 	









Answer Choices


 Growing human populations and the agricultural demands that come with such growth have upset the ecological balance in some areas and led to the spread of deserts  
 As periods of severe dryness have become more common  failures of a number of different crops have increased  
 Excessive numbers of cattle and the need for firewood for fuel have reduced grasses and trees  leaving the land unprotected and vulnerable  
 Extensive irrigation with poor drainage brings salt to the surface of the soil  a process that reduces water and air absorption  
 Animal dung enriches the soil by providing nutrients for plant growth  
 Grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation in semiarid lands  



Early Cinema
The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial  peepshow  format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater  In the peepshow format  a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose  Thomas Edison s peepshow device  the Kinetoscope  was introduced to the public in 1894  It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors  or arcades  which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short  50 foot film at any one time  The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines  For the price of 25 cents  or 5 cents per machine   customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films  or  in the case of famous prizefights  successive rounds of a single fight  
These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors  which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier  In the phonograph parlors  customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes  moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music  The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way  Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes  for roughly $1 000 apiece  to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them  which cost approximately $10 to $15 each   He refused to develop projection technology  reasoning that if he made and sold projectors  then exhibitors would purchase only one machine a projector from him instead of several 
Exhibitors  however  wanted to maximize their profits  which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time  rather than one at a time  and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission  About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894  showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere  Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins  and Orville and Woodville Latham  with the assistance of Edison s former assistant  William Dickson  perfected projection devices  These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters  legitimate theaters  local town halls  makeshift storefront theaters  fairgrounds  and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience 
With the advent of projection in 1895 1896  motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption  Previously  large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater  where vaudeville  popular dramas  musical and minstrel shows  classical plays  lectures  and slide and lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time  But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment  which depended on either live performance or  in the case of the slide and lantern shows  the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program 
Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts  the substance of the movies themselves is mass produced  prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor  Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures  their creative control remained limited  What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies  the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains  of waves striking the shore  and of people walking in the street  and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera 
With the advent of projection  the viewer s relationship with the image was no longer private  as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope  which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid  It suddenly became public an experience that the viewer shared with dozens  scores  and even hundreds of others  At the same time  the image that the spectator looked at expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches  in height  to the life size proportions of 6 or 9 feet

Aggression
When one animal attacks another  it engages in the most obvious example of aggressive behavior  Psychologists have adopted several approaches to understanding aggressive behavior in people 
The Biological Approach  Numerous biological structures and chemicals appear to be involved in aggression  One is the hypothalamus  a region of the brain  In response to certain stimuli  many animals show instinctive aggressive reactions  The hypothalamus appears to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern  electrical stimulation of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals  In people  however  whose brains are more complex  other brain structures apparently moderate possible instincts 
An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people  Sociobiology views much social behavior  including aggressive behavior  as genetically determined  Consider Darwin s theory of evolution  Darwin held that many more individuals are produced than can find food and survive into adulthood  A struggle for survival follows  Those individuals who possess characteristics that provide them with an advantage in the struggle for existence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next generation  In many species  such characteristics include aggressiveness  Because aggressive individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce  whatever genes are linked to aggressive behavior are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generations 
The sociobiology view has been attacked on numerous grounds  One is that people s capacity to outwit other species  not their aggressiveness  appears to be the dominant factor in human survival  Another is that there is too much variation among people to believe that they are dominated by  or at the mercy of  aggressive impulses 
The Psychodynamic Approach  Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior  including aggression  Sigmund Freud  for example  believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable reactions to the frustrations of daily life  Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people  including their parents  because even the most attentive parents cannot gratify all of their demands immediately  Yet children  also fearing their parents  punishment and the loss of parental love  come to repress most aggressive impulses  The Freudian perspective  in a sense  sees us as  steam engines   By holding in rather than venting  steam   we set the stage for future explosions  Pent up aggressive impulses demand outlets  They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture  or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life 
According to psychodynamic theory  the best ways to prevent harmful aggression may be to encourage less harmful aggression  In the steam engine analogy  verbal aggression may vent some of the aggressive steam  So might cheering on one s favorite sports team  Psychoanalysts  therapists adopting a psychodynamic approach  refer to the venting of aggressive impulses as  catharsis   Catharsis is theorized to be a safety valve  But research findings on the usefulness of catharsis are mixed  Some studies suggest that catharsis leads to reductions in tension and a lowered likelihood of future aggression  Other studies  however  suggest that letting some steam escape actually encourages more aggression later on 
The Cognitive Approach  Cognitive psychologists assert that our behavior is influenced by our values  by the ways in which we interpret our situations and by choice  For example  people who believe that aggression is necessary and justified as during wartime are likely to act aggressively  whereas people who believe that a particular war or act of aggression is unjust  or who think that aggression is never justified  are less likely to behave aggressively 
One cognitive theory suggests that aggravating and painful events trigger unpleasant feelings  These feelings  in turn  can lead to aggressive action  but not automatically  Cognitive factors intervene  People decide whether they will act aggressively or not on the basis of factors such as their experiences with aggression and their interpretation of other people s motives  Supporting evidence comes from research showing that aggressive people often distort other people s motives  For example  they assume that other people mean them harm when they do not 
Catharsis  In psychodynamic theory  the purging of strong emotions or the relieving of tensions 



1  According to paragraph 2  what evidence indicates that aggression in animals is related to the hypothalamus  
 Some aggressive animal species have a highly developed hypothalamus  
 Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus delays animals  inborn reaction patterns 
 Animals behaving aggressively show increased activity in the hypothalamus 
 Animals who lack a hypothalamus display few aggressive tendencies 






2  According to Darwin s theory of evolution  members of a species are forced to struggle for survival because
 not all individuals are skilled in finding food
 individuals try to defend their young against attackers
 many more individuals are born than can survive until the age of reproduction
 individuals with certain genes are more likely to reach adulthood


















3  The word  inevitable  in the passage is closest in meaning to

 regrettable
 controllable
 unsuitable

4  The word  gratify  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 identify
 modify
 satisfy
 simplify

5  The word  they  in the passage refers to  
 future explosions
 pent up aggressive impulses
 outlets

6  According to paragraph 5  Freud believed that children experience conflict between a desire to vent aggression on their parents and  
 a frustration that their parents do not give them everything they want
 a fear that their parents will punish them and stop loving them
 a desire to take care of their parents
 a desire to vent aggression on other family members


7  Freud describes people as  steam engines  in order to make the point that people  
 deliberately build up their aggression to make themselves stronger
 usually release aggression in explosive ways
 must vent their aggression to prevent it from building up
 typically lose their aggression if they do not express it

Artisans and Industrialization
Before 1815 manufacturing in the United States had been done in homes or shops by skilled artisans  As master craft workers  they imparted the knowledge of their trades to apprentices and journeymen  In addition  women often worked in their homes part time  making finished articles from raw material supplied by merchant capitalists  After 1815 this older form of manufacturing began to give way to factories with machinery tended by unskilled or semiskilled laborers  Cheap transportation networks  the rise of cities  and the availability of capital and credit all stimulated the shift to factory production 
The creation of a labor force that was accustomed to working in factories did not occur easily  Before the rise of the factory  artisans had worked within the home  Apprentices were considered part of the family  and masters were responsible not only for teaching their apprentices a trade but also for providing them some education and for supervising their moral behavior  Journeymen knew that if they perfected their skill  they could become respected master artisans with their own shops  Also  skilled artisans did not work by the clock  at a steady pace  but rather in bursts of intense labor alternating with more leisurely time 
The factory changed that  Goods produced by factories were not as finished or elegant as those done by hand  and pride in craftsmanship gave way to the pressure to increase rates of productivity  The new methods of doing business involved a new and stricter sense of time  Factory life necessitated a more regimented schedule  where work began at the sound of a bell and workers kept machines going at a constant pace  At the same time  workers were required to discard old habits  for industrialism demanded a worker who was alert  dependable  and self disciplined  Absenteeism and lateness hurt productivity and  since work was specialized  disrupted the regular factory routine  Industrialization not only produced a fundamental change in the way work was organized  it transformed the very nature of work 
The first generation to experience these changes did not adopt the new attitudes easily  The factory clock became the symbol of the new work rules  One mill worker who finally quit complained revealingly about  obedience to the ding dong of the bell just as though we are so many living machines   With the loss of personal freedom also came the loss of standing in the community  Unlike artisan workshops in which apprentices worked closely with the masters supervising them  factories sharply separated workers from management  Few workers rose through the ranks to supervisory positions  and even fewer could achieve the artisan s dream of setting up one s own business  Even well paid workers sensed their decline in status 
In this newly emerging economic order  workers sometimes organized to protect their rights and traditional ways of life  Craft workers such as carpenters  printers  and tailors formed unions  and in 1834 individual unions came together in the National Trades  Union  The labor movement gathered some momentum in the decade before the Panic of 1837  but in the depression that followed  labor s strength collapsed  During hard times  few workers were willing to strike* or engage in collective action  And skilled craft workers  who spearheaded the union movement  did not feel a particularly strong bond with semiskilled factory workers and unskilled laborers  More than a decade of agitation did finally bring a workday shortened to 10 hours to most industries by the 1850 s  and the courts also recognized workers  right to strike  but these gains had little immediate impact 
Workers were united in resenting the industrial system and their loss of status  but they were divided by ethnic and racial antagonisms  gender  conflicting religious perspectives  occupational differences  political party loyalties  and disagreements over tactics  For them  the factory and industrialism were not agents of opportunity but reminders of their loss of independence and a measure of control over their lives  As United States society became more specialized and differentiated  greater extremes of wealth began to appear  And as the new markets created fortunes for the few  the factory system lowered the wages of workers by dividing labor into smaller  less skilled tasks

Swimming Machines
Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes  marlins  sailfishes  and swordfish  swim continuously  Feeding  courtship  reproduction  and even  rest  are carried out while in constant motion  As a result  practically every aspect of the body form and function of these swimming  machines  is adapted to enhance their ability to swim 
Many of the adaptations of these fishes serve to reduce water resistance  drag   Interestingly enough  several of these hydrodynamic adaptations resemble features designed to improve the aerodynamics of high speed aircraft  Though human engineers are new to the game  tunas and their relatives evolved their  high tech  designs long ago 
Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes have made streamlining into an art form  Their bodies are sleek and compact  The body shapes of tunas  in fact  are nearly ideal from an engineering point of view  Most species lack scales over most of the body  making it smooth and slippery  The eyes lie flush with the body and do not protrude at all  They are also covered with a slick  transparent lid that reduces drag  The fins are stiff  smooth  and narrow  qualities that also help cut drag  When not in use  the fins are tucked into special grooves or depressions so that they lie flush with the body and do not break up its smooth contours  Airplanes retract their landing gear while in flight for the same reason 
Tunas  mackerels  and billfishes have even more sophisticated adaptations than these to improve their hydrodynamics  The long bill of marlins  sailfishes  and swordfish probably helps them slip through the water  Many supersonic aircraft have a similar needle at the nose  
Most tunas and billfishes have a series of keels and finlets near the tail  Although most of their scales have been lost  tunas and mackerels retain a patch of coarse scales near the head called the corselet  The keels  finlets  and corselet help direct the flow of water over the body surface in such a way as to reduce resistance  see the figure   Again  supersonic jets have similar features 
Because they are always swimming  tunas simply have to open their mouths and water is forced in and over their gills  Accordingly  they have lost most of the muscles that other fishes use to suck in water and push it past the gills  In fact  tunas must swim to breathe  They must also keep swimming to keep from sinking  since most have largely or completely lost the swim bladder  the gas filled sac that helps most other fish remain buoyant  
One potential problem is that opening the mouth to breathe detracts from the streamlining of these fishes and tends to slow them down  Some species of tuna have specialized grooves in their tongue  It is thought that these grooves help to channel water through the mouth and out the gill slits  thereby reducing water resistance  
There are adaptations that increase the amount of forward thrust as well as those that reduce drag  Again  these fishes are the envy of engineers  Their high  narrow tails with swept back tips are almost perfectly adapted to provide propulsion with the least possible effort  Perhaps most important of all to these and other fast swimmers is their ability to sense and make use of swirls and eddies  circular currents  in the water  They can glide past eddies that would slow them down and then gain extra thrust by  pushing off  the eddies  Scientists and engineers are beginning to study this ability of fishes in the hope of designing more efficient propulsion systems for ships  
The muscles of these fishes and the mechanism that maintains a warm body temperature are also highly efficient  A bluefin tuna in water of 7°C  45°F  can maintain a core temperature of over 25°C  77°F   This warm body temperature may help not only the muscles to work better  but also the brain and the eyes  The billfishes have gone one step further  They have evolved special  heaters  of modified muscle tissue that warm the eyes and brain  maintaining peak performance of these critical organs

Nineteenth Century Politics in the United States
The development of the modern presidency in the United States began with Andrew Jackson who swept to power in 1829 at the head of the Democratic Party and served until 1837  During his administration  he immeasurably enlarged the power of the presidency   The President is the direct representative of the American people   he lectured the Senate when it opposed him   He was elected by the people  and is responsible to them   With this declaration  Jackson redefined the character of the presidential office and its relationship to the people 
During Jackson s second term  his opponents had gradually come together to form the Whig party  Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the market  banks  and commerce  The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing conflict between  the people  farmers  planters  and workers and a set of greedy aristocrats  This  paper money aristocracy  of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit  Democrats claimed  and sapped the nation s virtue by encouraging speculation and the desire for sudden  unearned wealth  The Democrats wanted the rewards of the market without sacrificing the features of a simple agrarian republic  They wanted the wealth that the market offered without the competitive  changing society  the complex dealing  the dominance of urban centers  and the loss of independence that came with it 
Whigs  on the other hand  were more comfortable with the market  For them  commerce and economic development were agents of civilization  Nor did the Whigs envision any conflict in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople and bankers on the other  Economic growth would benefit everyone by raising national income and expanding opportunity  The government s responsibility was to provide a well regulated economy that guaranteed opportunity for citizens of ability 
Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the market but also about how active the central government should be in people s lives  Despite Andrew Jackson s inclination to be a strong President  Democrats as a rule believed in limited government  Government s role in the economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies  and special privileges  In keeping with this philosophy of limited government  Democrats also rejected the idea that moral beliefs were the proper sphere of government action  Religion and politics  they believed  should be kept clearly separate  and they generally opposed humanitarian legislation 
The Whigs  in contrast  viewed government power positively  They believed that it should be used to protect individual rights and public liberty  and that it had a special role where individual effort was ineffective  By regulating the economy and competition  the government could ensure equal opportunity  Indeed  for Whigs the concept of government promoting the general welfare went beyond the economy  In particular  Whigs in the northern sections of the United States also believed that government power should be used to foster the moral welfare of the country  They were much more likely to favor social reform legislation and aid to education 
 In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was similar  To be competitive in winning votes  Whigs and Democrats both had to have significant support among farmers  the largest group in society  and workers  Neither party could win an election by appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor  The Whigs  however  enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business and commercial classes  Whigs appealed to planters who needed credit to finance their cotton and rice trade in the world market  to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses  and to workers who wished to improve themselves  Democrats attracted farmers isolated from the market or uncomfortable with it  workers alienated from the emerging industrial system  and rising entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies and open the economy to newcomers like themselves  The Whigs were strongest in the towns  cities  and those rural areas that were fully integrated into the market economy  whereas Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and languishing economically

The Expression of Emotions
Joy and sadness are experienced by people in all cultures around the world  but how can we tell when other people are happy or despondent  It turns out that the expression of many emotions may be universal  Smiling is apparently a universal sign of friendliness and approval  Baring the teeth in a hostile way  as noted by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century  may be a universal sign of anger  As the originator of the theory of evolution  Darwin believed that the universal recognition of facial expressions would have survival value  For example  facial expressions could signal the approach of enemies  or friends  in the absence of language 
Most investigators concur that certain facial expressions suggest the same emotions in all people  Moreover  people in diverse cultures recognize the emotions manifested by the facial expressions  In classic research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger  disgust  fear  happiness  and sadness  He then asked people around the world to indicate what emotions were being depicted in them  Those queried ranged from European college students to members of the Fore  a tribe that dwells in the New Guinea highlands  All groups  including the Fore  who had almost no contact with Western culture  agreed on the portrayed emotions  The Fore also displayed familiar facial expressions when asked how they would respond if they were the characters in stories that called for basic emotional responses  Ekman and his colleagues more recently obtained similar results in a study of ten cultures in which participants were permitted to report that multiple emotions were shown by facial expressions  The participants generally agreed on which two emotions were being shown and which emotion was more intense  
Psychological researchers generally recognize that facial expressions reflect emotional states  In fact  various emotional states give rise to certain patterns of electrical activity in the facial muscles and in the brain  The facial feedback hypothesis argues  however  that the causal relationship between emotions and facial expressions can also work in the opposite direction  According to this hypothesis  signals from the facial muscles   feedback   are sent back to emotion centers of the brain  and so a person s facial expression can influence that person s emotional state  Consider Darwin s words   The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it  On the other hand  the repression  as far as possible  of all outward signs softens our emotions   Can smiling give rise to feelings of good will  for example  and frowning to anger 
Psychological research has given rise to some interesting findings concerning the facial feedback hypothesis  Causing participants in experiments to smile  for example  leads them to report more positive feelings and to rate cartoons  humorous drawings of people or situations  as being more humorous  When they are caused to frown  they rate cartoons as being more aggressive 
What are the possible links between facial expressions and emotion  One link is arousal  which is the level of activity or preparedness for activity in an organism  Intense contraction of facial muscles  such as those used in signifying fear  heightens arousal  Self perception of heightened arousal then leads to heightened emotional activity  Other links may involve changes in brain temperature and the release of neurotransmitters  substances that transmit nerve impulses   The contraction of facial muscles both influences the internal emotional state and reflects it  Ekman has found that the so called Duchenne smile  which is characterized by   crow s feet  wrinkles around the eyes and a subtle drop in the eye cover fold so that the skin above the eye moves down slightly toward the eyeball  can lead to pleasant feelings 
Ekman s observation may be relevant to the British expression  keep a stiff upper lip  as a recommendation for handling stress  It might be that a  stiff  lip suppresses emotional response as long as the lip is not quivering with fear or tension  But when the emotion that leads to stiffening the lip is more intense  and involves strong muscle tension  facial feedback may heighten emotional response

Geology and Landscape

Most people consider the landscape to be unchanging  but Earth is a dynamic body  and its surface is continually altering slowly on the human time scale  but relatively rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth  about 4 500 billion years   There are two principal influences that shape the terrain  constructive processes such as uplift  which create new landscape features  and destructive forces such as erosion  which gradually wear away exposed landforms 

Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence  successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature  but in fact they tend to be relatively short lived in geological terms  As a general rule  the higher a mountain is  the more recently it was formed  for example  the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old  Lower mountains tend to be older  and are often the eroded relics of much higher mountain chains  About 400 million years ago  when the present day continents of North America and Europe were joined  the Caledonian mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas  Today  however  the relics of the Caledonian orogeny  mountain building period  exist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland  the northern Appalachians in the United States  the Scottish Highlands  and the Norwegian coastal plateau 

The Earth s crust is thought to be divided into huge  movable segments  called plates  which float on a soft plastic layer of rock  Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the plate margins  In this process  sedimentary rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26 000 feet  Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes  which fracture the Earth s crust and can displace enough rock to produce Block Mountains  A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of volcanic activity which occurs in regions of active fold mountain belts  such as in the Cascade Range of western North America  The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic materials  Many of the peaks are extinct volcanoes 

Whatever the reason for mountain formation  as soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to destructive forces  The exposed rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments  which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments  Thus  any landscape represents only a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of erosion 

The weather  in its many forms  is the main agent of erosion  Rain washes away loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks  Carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the rainwater  forming a weak acid  carbonic acid  that may chemically attack the rocks  The rain seeps underground and the water may reappear later as springs  These springs are the sources of streams and rivers  which cut through the rocks and carry away debris from the mountains to the lowlands 

Under very cold conditions  rocks can be shattered by ice and frost  Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas  and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys  carrying with them huge quantities of eroded rock debris  In dry areas the wind is the principal agent of erosion  It carries fine particles of sand  which bombard exposed rock surfaces  thereby wearing them into yet more sand  Even living things contribute to the formation of landscapes  Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and  in so doing  speed their splitting  In contrast  the roots of grasses and other small plants may help to hold loose soil fragments together  thereby helping to prevent erosion by the wind

Groundwater
Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground  filling all the available spaces  By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water  this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle  Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface  from precipitation  rain and snow  and from lakes and streams  There it remains  sometimes for long periods  before emerging at the surface again  At first thought it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the  solid  ground underfoot to hold all this water  
The necessary space is there  however  in many forms  The commonest spaces are those among the particles sand grains and tiny pebbles of loose  unconsolidated sand and gravel  Beds of this material  out of sight beneath the soil  are common  They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed  For example  as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away  huge volumes of water flowed from them  The water was always laden with pebbles  gravel  and sand  known as glacial outwash  that was deposited as the flow slowed down  
The same thing happens to this day  though on a smaller scale  wherever a sediment laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land  dropping its load as the current slows  the water usually spreads out fanwise  depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth  fan shaped slope  Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea  the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first  but will be located inland at some future date  when the sea level falls or the land rises  such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick 
In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil  if they are now below the water s upper surface  the water table   the gravels and sands of the former riverbed  and its sandbars  will be saturated with groundwater  
So much for unconsolidated sediments  Consolidated  or cemented  sediments  too  contain millions of minute water holding pores  This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally plugged with cementing chemicals  also  parts of the original grains may become dissolved by percolating groundwater  either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards  The result is that sandstone  for example  can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed 
Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment  loose or cemented  consists of empty space  Most crystalline rocks are much more solid  a common exception is basalt  a form of solidified volcanic lava  which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous 
The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity  But note that porosity is not the same as permeability  which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material  this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking them 
Much of the water in a sample of water saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place  But some will remain  clinging to all solid surfaces  It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface  leaving it totally dry  The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can  and water that cannot  drain away  
The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another  even though their porosities may be the same  What happens depends on pore size  If the pores are large  the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to hold  and it will drain away  but if the pores are small enough  the water in them will exist as thin films  too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place  then the water will be firmly held  



1  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about the ground that we walk on 
 It cannot hold rainwater for long periods of time 
 It prevents most groundwater from circulating 
 It has the capacity to store large amounts of water

11  What is the main purpose of paragraph 7  
 To explain why water can flow through rock
 To emphasize the large amount of empty space in all rock
 To point out that a rock cannot be both porous and permeable
 To distinguish between two related properties of rock


12  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 Surface tension is not strong enough to retain drops of water in rocks with large pores but it strong enough to hold on to thin films of water in rocks with small pores 
 Water in rocks is held in place by large pores and drains away from small size pores through surface tension 
 Small pores and large pores both interact with surface tension to determine whether a rock will hold water as heavy drops or as a thin film 
 If the force of surface tension is too weak to hold water in place as heavy drops  the water will continue to be held firmly in place as a thin film when large pores exist

Much of the ground is actually saturated with water 
 
 
 


Answer choices

 Sediments that hold water were spread by glaciers and are still spread by rivers and streams 
 Water is stored underground in beds of loose sand and gravel or in cemented sediment 
 The size of a saturated rock s pores determines how much water it will retain when the rock is put in a dry place 
 Groundwater often remains underground for a long time before it emerges again 
 Like sandstone  basalt is a crystalline rock that is very porous 
 Beds of unconsolidated sediments are typically located at inland sites that were once underwater 











The Origins of Theater
In seeking to describe the origins of theater  one must rely primarily on speculation  since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw  The most widely accepted theory  championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual  The process perceived by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly  During the early stages of its development  a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well being  Having little understanding of natural causes  it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces  and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces  Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires  the group repeats  refines and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies  or rituals 
Stories  myths  may then grow up around a ritual  Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence  Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations  As a person becomes more sophisticated  its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change  As a result  it may abandon or modify some rites  But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group s oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites  When this occurs  the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity  and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns  
Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular  it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being  Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative  Under this theory  relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures  Thus  the recalling of an event  a hunt  battle  or other feat  is elaborated through the narrator s pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person 
A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic  rhythmical or gymnastic  or from imitations of animal noises and sounds  Admiration for the performer s skill  virtuosity  and grace are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances  
In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater  scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater  Why did theater develop  and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual  Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs  One  set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B C   sees humans as naturally imitative as taking pleasure in imitating persons  things  and actions and in seeing such imitations  Another  advanced in the twentieth century  suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy  through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life  Thus  fantasy or fiction  of which drama is one form  permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears  confront them  and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact  The theater  then  is one tool whereby people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities 
But neither the human imitative instinct nor a penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater  Therefore  additional explanations are needed  One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems  For example  one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision  since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group  Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense  For example  some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well being and abandoned them  nevertheless  they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness

Timberline Vegetation on Mountains

The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a mountain slope is often a dramatic one  Within a vertical distance of just a few tens of meters  trees disappear as a life form and are replaced by low shrubs  herbs  and grasses  This rapid zone of transition is called the upper timberline or tree line  In many semiarid areas there is also a lower timberline where the forest passes into steppe or desert at its lower edge  usually because of a lack of moisture 

The upper timberline  like the snow line  is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions  It ranges from sea level in the Polar Regions to 4 500 meters in the dry subtropics and 3 500 4 500 meters in the moist tropics  Timberline trees are normally evergreens  suggesting that these have some advantage over deciduous trees  those that lose their leaves  in the extreme environments of the upper timberline  There are some areas  however  where broadleaf deciduous trees form the timberline  Species of birch  for example  may occur at the timberline in parts of the Himalayas 

At the upper timberline the trees begin to become twisted and deformed  This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes  which tend to attain greater heights on ridges  whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valleys  This is because middle  and upper  latitude timberlines are strongly influenced by the duration and depth of the snow cover  As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys  trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges  even though they are more exposed to high velocity winds and poor  thin soils there  In the tropics  the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less prone to dry out  they have less frost  and they have deeper soils 

There is still no universally agreed on explanation for why there should be such a dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline  Various environmental factors may play a role  Too much snow  for example  can smother trees  and avalanches and snow creep can damage or destroy them  Late lying snow reduces the effective growing season to the point where seedlings cannot establish themselves  Wind velocity also increases with altitude and may cause serious stress for trees  as is made evident by the deformed shapes at high altitudes  Some scientists have proposed that the presence of increasing levels of ultraviolet light with elevation may play a role  while browsing and grazing animals like the ibex may be another contributing factor  Probably the most important environmental factor is temperature  for if the growing season is too short and temperatures are too low  tree shoots and buds cannot mature sufficiently to survive the winter months 

Above the tree line there is a zone that is generally called alpine tundra  Immediately adjacent to the timberline  the tundra consists of a fairly complete cover of low lying shrubs  herbs  and grasses  while higher up the number and diversity of species decrease until there is much bare ground with occasional mosses and lichens and some prostrate cushion plants  Some plants can even survive in favorable microhabitats above the snow line  The highest plants in the world occur at around 6 100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas  At this great height  rocks  warmed by the sun  melt small snowdrifts 

The most striking characteristic of the plants of the alpine zone is their low growth form  This enables them to avoid the worst rigors of high winds and permits them to make use of the higher temperatures immediately adjacent to the ground surface  In an area where low temperatures are limiting to life  the importance of the additional heat near the surface is crucial  The low growth form can also permit the plants to take advantage of the insulation provided by a winter snow cover  In the equatorial mountains the low growth form is less prevalent

 Tree growth lasts longer in those latitudes than it does in the tropics 















9  Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  In correct choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Because of their deformed shapes at high altitudes  trees are not likely to be seriously harmed by the strong winds typical of those altitudes 
 As altitude increases  the velocity of winds increase  leading to a serious decrease in the number of trees found at high altitudes 
 The deformed shapes of trees at high altitudes show that wind velocity  which increase with altitude  can cause serious hardship for trees 
 Increased wind velocity at high altitudes deforms the shapes of trees  and this may cause serious stress for trees 
10  In paragraph 4  what is the author s main purpose in the discussion of the dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline 
 To argue that none of several environment factors that are believed to contribute to that phenomenon do in fact play a role in causing it 
 To argue in support of one particular explanation of that phenomenon against several competing explanations

At the timberline  whether upper or lower  there is a profound change in the growth of trees and other plants 
 
 
 


Answer choices


 Birch is one of the few species of tree that can survive in the extreme environments of the upper timberline 
 There is no agreement among scientists as to exactly why plant growth is sharply different above and below the upper timberline 
 The temperature at the upper timberline is probably more important in preventing tree growth than factors such as the amount of snowfall or the force of winds 
 The geographical location of an upper timberline has an impact on both the types of trees found there and their physical characteristics 
 High levels of ultraviolet light most likely play a greater role in determining tree growth at the upper timberline than do grazing animals such as the ibex 
 Despite being adjacent to the timberline  the alpine tundra is an area where certain kinds of low trees can endure high winds and very low temperatures 









 
TPO 3
Architecture
Architecture is the art and science of designing structures that organize and enclose space for practical and symbolic purposes  Because architecture grows out of human needs and aspirations  it clearly communicates cultural values  Of all the visual arts  architecture affects our lives most directly for it determines the character of the human environment in major ways 
Architecture is a three dimensional form  It utilizes space  mass  texture  line  light  and color  To be architecture  a building must achieve a working harmony with a variety of elements  Humans instinctively seek structures that will shelter and enhance their way of life  It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not simply constructions but also offer inspiration and delight  Buildings contribute to human life when they provide shelter  enrich space  complement their site  suit the climate  and are economically feasible  The client who pays for the building and defines its function is an important member of the architectural team  The mediocre design of many contemporary buildings can be traced to both clients and architects 
In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose  architecture employs methods of support that  because they are based on physical laws  have changed little since people first discovered them even while building materials have changed dramatically  The world s architectural structures have also been devised in relation to the objective limitations of materials  Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they deal with downward forces created by gravity  They are designed to withstand the forces of compression  pushing together   tension  pulling apart   bending  or a combination of these in different parts of the structure 
Even development in architecture has been the result of major technological changes  Materials and methods of construction are integral parts of the design of architecture structures  In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available  such as wood  stone  brick  Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired  Enormous changes in materials and techniques of construction within the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material  Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built now and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago 
Modern architectural forms generally have three separate components comparable to elements of the human body  a supporting skeleton or frame  an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces  and equipment  similar to the body s vital organs and systems  The equipment includes plumbing  electrical wiring  hot water  and air conditioning  Of course in early architecture such as igloos and adobe structures there was no such equipment  and the skeleton and skin were often one 
Much of the world s great architecture has been constructed of stone because of its beauty  permanence  and availability  In the past  whole cities grew from the arduous task of cutting and piling stone upon  Some of the world s finest stone architecture can be seen in the ruins of the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru  The doorways and windows are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above  A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created  That invention was the arch  a curved structure originally made of separate stone or brick segments  The arch was used by the early cultures of the Mediterranean area chiefly for underground drains  but it was the Romans who first developed and used the arch extensively in aboveground structures  Roman builders perfected the semicircular arch made of separate blocks of stone  As a method of spanning space  the arch can support greater weight than a horizontal beam  It works in compression to divert the weight above it out to the sides  where the weight is borne by the vertical elements on either side of the arch  The arch is among the many important structural breakthroughs that have characterized architecture throughout the centuries

Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer

The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s  This region has a semiarid climate  and for 50 years after its settlement  it supported a low intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming  In the early twentieth century  however  it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge aquifer  a rock layer containing large quantities of groundwater   This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians  who once inhabited the region 
The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583 000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota  Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30 000 years  Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron  but unfortunately  under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region  rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal  amounting to about half a centimeter a year 
The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930s  The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture  especially from the 1950s onward  transformed the economy of the region  More than 100 000 wells now tap the Ogallala  Modern irrigation devices  each capable of spraying 4 5 million liters of water a day  have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops  Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton  sorghum  wheat  and corn grown in the United States  In addition  40 percent of American grain fed beef cattle are fattened here 
This unprecedented development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate that is  virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically  In the 1930s  wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters  currently  they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more  In places  the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year  necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever more powerful pumps  It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates  much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years  The situation is most critical in Texas  where the climate is driest  the greatest amount of water is being pumped  and the aquifer contains the least water  It is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will  by the year 2030  support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated acreage in Texas that is supported in 1980 
The reaction of farmers to the inevitable depletion of the Ogallala varies  Many have been attempting to conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that require less water  Others  however  have adopted the philosophy that it is best to use the water while it is still economically profitable to do so and to concentrate on high value crops such as cotton  The incentive of the farmers who wish to conserve water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water  and in the process are drawing down the entire region s water supplies 
In the face of the upcoming water supply crisis  a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to transport vast quantities of water by canal or pipeline from the Mississippi  the Missouri  or the Arkansas rivers  Unfortunately  the cost of water obtained through any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at least tenfold  making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets  Somewhat more promising have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water  water in the soil  above the water table by injecting compressed air into the ground  Even if this process proves successful  however  it would almost triple water costs  Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution  as new strains of drought resistant crops continue to be developed  Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be  it is evident that within the High Plains  irrigation water will never again be the abundant  inexpensive resource it was during the agricultural boom years of the mid twentieth century

The Ogallala aquifer is a large underground source of water in the High Plains region of the United States 
 
 
 

Answer choices

 The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States 
 Given the aquifer s low recharge rate  its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion 
 Releasing capillary water and introducing drought resistant crops are less promising solutions to the water supply crisis than bringing in river water
 The periodic deepening of wells and the use of more powerful pumps would help increase the natural recharge rate of the Ogallala 
 In Texas  a great deal of attention is being paid to genetic engineering because it is there that the most critical situation exists 
 Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed  but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low 

 
The Long Term Stability of Ecosystems
Plant communities assemble themselves flexibly  and their particular structure depends on the specific history of the area  Ecologists use the term  succession  to refer to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time  The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community  while the long lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community  Pioneer and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years  These changes in plant numbers and the mix of species are cumulative  Climax communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years 
An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it relatively unchanged in a year s time  Individual fish may be replaced  but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next  We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem 
At one time  ecologists believed that species diversity made ecosystems stable  They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem  Support for this idea came from the observation that long lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than pioneer communities  Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity  To take an extreme example  farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crop  In contrast  a complex climax community  such as a temperate forest  will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pests 
The question of ecosystem stability is complicated  however  The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what  stability  means  Stability can be defined as simply lack of change  In that case  the climax community would be considered the most stable  since  by definition  it changes the least over time  Alternatively  stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance  such as a fire  This kind of stability is also called resilience  In that case  climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable  since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state 
Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity  At least in temperate zones  maximum diversity is often found in mid successional stages  not in the climax community  Once a redwood forest matures  for example  the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced  In general  diversity  by itself  does not ensure stability  Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability just the opposite  in fact  A more complicated system is  in general  more likely than a simple system to break down  A fifteen speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child s tricycle 
Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors contribute to the resilience of communities because climax communities all over the world are being severely damaged or destroyed by human activities  The destruction caused by the volcanic explosion of Mount St  Helens  in the northwestern United States  for example  pales in comparison to the destruction caused by humans  We need to know what aspects of a community are most important to the community s resistance to destruction  as well as its recovery 

Many ecologists now think that the relative long term stability of climax communities comes not from diversity but from the  patchiness  of the environment  an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is uniform  A local population that goes extinct is quickly replaced by immigrants from an adjacent community  Even if the new population is of a different species  it can approximately fill the niche vacated by the extinct population and keep the food web intact

Opportunists and Competitors
Growth  reproduction  and daily metabolism all require an organism to expend energy  The expenditure of energy is essentially a process of budgeting  just as finances are budgeted  If all of one s money is spent on clothes  there may be none left to buy food or go to the movies  Similarly  a plant or animal cannot squander all its energy on growing a big body if none would be left over for reproduction  for this is the surest way to extinction 
All organisms  therefore  allocate energy to growth  reproduction  maintenance  and storage  No choice is involved  this allocation comes as part of the genetic package from the parents  Maintenance for a given body design of an organism is relatively constant  Storage is important  but ultimately that energy will be used for maintenance  reproduction  or growth  Therefore the principal differences in energy allocation are likely to be between growth and reproduction 
Almost all of an organism s energy can be diverted to reproduction  with very little allocated to building the body  Organisms at this extreme are  opportunists   At the other extreme are  competitors   almost all of whose resources are invested in building a huge body  with a bare minimum allocated to reproduction 
Dandelions are good examples of opportunists  Their seed heads raised just high enough above the ground to catch the wind  the plants are no bigger than they need be  their stems are hollow  and all the rigidity comes from their water content  Thus  a minimum investment has been made in the body that becomes a platform for seed dispersal  These very short lived plants reproduce prolifically  that is to say they provide a constant rain of seed in the neighborhood of parent plants  A new plant will spring up wherever a seed falls on a suitable soil surface  but because they do not build big bodies  they cannot compete with other plants for space  water  or sunlight  These plants are termed opportunists because they rely on their seeds  falling into settings where competing plants have been removed by natural processes  such as along an eroding riverbank  on landslips  or where a tree falls and creates a gap in the forest canopy 
Opportunists must constantly invade new areas to compensate for being displaced by more competitive species  Human landscapes of lawns  fields  or flowerbeds provide settings with bare soil and a lack of competitors that are perfect habitats for colonization by opportunists  Hence  many of the strongly opportunistic plants are the common weeds of fields and gardens  
Because each individual is short lived  the population of an opportunist species is likely to be adversely affected by drought  bad winters  or floods  If their population is tracked through time  it will be seen to be particularly unstable soaring and plummeting in irregular cycles  
The opposite of an opportunist is a competitor  These organisms tend to have big bodies  are long lived  and spend relatively little effort each year on reproduction  An oak tree is a good example of a competitor  A massive oak claims its ground for 200 years or more  outcompeting all other would be canopy trees by casting a dense shade and drawing up any free water in the soil  The leaves of an oak tree taste foul because they are rich in tannins  a chemical that renders them distasteful or indigestible to many organisms  The tannins are part of the defense mechanism that is essential to longevity  Although oaks produce thousands of acorns  the investment in a crop of acorns is small compared with the energy spent on building leaves  trunk  and roots  Once an oak tree becomes established  it is likely to survive minor cycles of drought and even fire  A population of oaks is likely to be relatively stable through time  and its survival is likely to depend more on its ability to withstand the pressures of competition or predation than on its ability to take advantage of chance events  It should be noted  however  that the pure opportunist or pure competitor is rare in nature  as most species fall between the extremes of a continuum  exhibiting a blend of some opportunistic and some competitive characteristics

Lascaux Cave Paintings
In Southwest France in the 1940 s  playing children discovered Lascaux Grotto  a series of narrow cave chambers that contain huge prehistoric paintings of animals  Many of these beasts are as large as 16 feet  almost 5 meters   Some follow each other in solemn parades  but others swirl about  sideways and upside down  The animals are bulls  wild horses  reindeer  bison  and mammoths outlined with charcoal and painted mostly in reds  yellow  and browns  Scientific analysis reveals that the colors were derived from ocher and other iron oxides ground into a fine powder  Methods of applying color varied  some colors were brushed or smeared on rock surfaces and others were blown or sprayed  It is possible that tubes made from animal bones were used for spraying because hollow bones  some stained with pigment  have been found nearby 
One of the most puzzling aspects of the paintings is their location  Other rock paintings for example  those of Bushmen in South Africa are either located near cave entrances or completely in the open  Cave paintings in France and Spain  however  are in recesses and caverns far removed from original cave entrances  This means that artists were forced to work in cramped spaces and without sources of natural light  It also implies that whoever made them did not want them to be easily found  Since cave dwellers normally lived close to entrances  there must have been some reason why so many generations of Lascaux cave dwellers hid their art 
Scholars offer three related but different opinions about the mysterious origin and significance of these paintings  One opinion is that the paintings were a record of seasonal migrations made by herds  Because some paintings were made directly over others  obliterating them  it is probable that a painting s value ended with the migration it pictured  Unfortunately  this explanation fails to explain the hidden locations  unless the migrations were celebrated with secret ceremonies 
Another opinion is that the paintings were directly related to hunting and were an essential part of a special preparation ceremony  This opinion holds that the pictures and whatever ceremony they accompanied were an ancient method of psychologically motivating hunters  It is conceivable that before going hunting the hunters would draw or study pictures of animals and imagine a successful hunt  Considerable support exists for this opinion because several animals in the pictures are wounded by arrows and spears  This opinion also attempts to solve the overpainting by explaining that an animal s picture had no further use after the hunt 
A third opinion takes psychological motivation much further into the realm of tribal ceremonies and mystery  the belief that certain animals assumed mythical significance as ancient ancestors or protectors of a given tribe or clan  Two types of images substantiate this theory  the strange  indecipherable geometric shapes that appear near some animals  and the few drawings of men  Wherever men appear they are crudely drawn and their bodies are elongated and rigid  Some men are in a prone position and some have bird or animal heads  Advocates for this opinion point to reports from people who have experienced a trance state  a highly suggestive state of low consciousness between waking and sleeping  Uniformly  these people experienced weightlessness and the sensation that their bodies were being stretched lengthwise  Advocates also point to people who believe that the forces of nature are inhabited by spirits  particularly shamans* who believe that an animal s spirit and energy is transferred to them while in a trance  One Lascaux narrative picture  which shows a man with a birdlike head and a wounded animal  would seem to lend credence to this third opinion  but there is still much that remains unexplained  For example  where is the proof that the man in the picture is a shaman  He could as easily be a hunter wearing a headmask  Many tribal hunters  including some Native Americans  camouflaged themselves by wearing animal heads and hides 
Perhaps so much time has passed that there will never be satisfactory answers to the cave images  but their mystique only adds to their importance  Certainly a great art exists  and by its existence reveals that ancient human beings were not without intelligence  skill  and sensitivity

 to resist forces of nature thought to be present in animals 


11  According to paragraph 6  why might the puzzling questions about the paintings never be answered

Answer Choices

 The paintings may have recorded information about animal migrations  and may only have been useful for one migration at a time 
 The human figures represented in the paintings appear to be less carefully shaped than those of animals 
 It is possible that the animals in the paintings were of mythical significance to the tribe  and the paintings reflected an important spiritual practice 
 Unlike painters of the recently discovered paintings  other Lascaux cave painters usually painted on rocks near cave entrances or in open spaces outside the caves 
 Some scholars believe that the paintings motivated hunters by allowing them to picture a successful hunt 
 Scientific analysis suggests that paintings were sprayed onto the rock walls with tubes made from animal bones 















 
Electricity from Wind

Since 1980  the use of wind to produce electricity has been growing rapidly  In 1994 there were nearly 20 000 wind turbines worldwide  most grouped in clusters called wind farms that collectively produced 3 000 megawatts of electricity  Most were in Denmark  which got 3 percent of its electricity from wind turbines  and California  where 17 000 machines produced 1 percent of the state s electricity  enough to meet the residential needs of a city as large as San Francisco   In principle  all the power needs of the United States could be provided by exploiting the wind potential of just three states North Dakota  South Dakota  and Texas  

Large wind farms can be built in six months to a year and then easily expanded as needed  With a moderate to fairly high net energy yield  these systems emit no heat trapping carbon dioxide or other air pollutants and need no water for cooling  manufacturing them produces little water pollution  The land under wind turbines can be used for grazing cattle and other purposes  and leasing land for wind turbines can provide extra income for farmers and ranchers 

Wind power has a significant cost advantage over nuclear power and has become competitive with coal fired power plants in many places  With new technological advances and mass production  projected cost declines should make wind power one of the world s cheapest ways to produce electricity  In the long run  electricity from large wind farms in remote areas might be used to make hydrogen gas from water during periods when there is less than peak demand for electricity  The hydrogen gas could then be fed into a storage system and used to generate electricity when additional or backup power is needed 

Wind power is most economical in areas with steady winds  In areas where the wind dies down  backup electricity from a utility company or from an energy storage system becomes necessary  Backup power could also be provided by linking wind farms with a solar cell  with conventional or pumped storage hydropower  or with efficient natural gas burning turbines  Some drawbacks to wind farms include visual pollution and noise  although these can be overcome by improving their design and locating them in isolated areas 

Large wind farms might also interfere with the flight patterns of migratory birds in certain areas  and they have killed large birds of prey  especially hawks  falcons  and eagles  that prefer to hunt along the same ridge lines that are ideal for wind turbines  The killing of birds of prey by wind turbines has pitted environmentalists who champion wildlife protection against environmentalists who promote renewable wind energy  Researchers are evaluating how serious this problem is and hope to find ways to eliminate or sharply reduce this problem  Some analysts also contend that the number of birds killed by wind turbines is dwarfed by birds killed by other human related sources and by the potential loss of entire bird species from possible global warming  Recorded deaths of birds of prey and other birds in wind farms in the United States currently amount to no more than 300 per year  By contrast  in the United States an estimated 97 million birds are killed each year when they collide with buildings made of plate glass  57 million are killed on highways each year  at least 3 8 million die annually from pollution and poisoning  and millions of birds are electrocuted each year by transmission and distribution lines carrying power produced by nuclear and coal power plants 

The technology is in place for a major expansion of wind power worldwide  Wind power is a virtually unlimited source of energy at favorable sites  and even excluding environmentally sensitive areas  the global potential of wind power is much higher than the current world electricity use  In theory  Argentina  Canada  Chile  China  Russia  and the United Kingdom could use wind to meet all of their energy needs  Wind power experts project that by the middle of the twenty first century wind power could supply more than 10 percent of the world s electricity and 10 25 percent of the electricity used in the United States

 They rely largely on coal fired power plants  
 They contain remote areas where the winds rarely die down  
 Over 1 percent of the electricity in these states is produced by wind farms  
 Wind farms in these states are being expanded to meet the power needs of the United States  



4  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is true about periods when the demand for electricity is relatively low 
 These periods are times when wind turbines are powered by hydrogen gas  
 These periods provide the opportunity to produce and store energy for future use  
 These periods create storage problems for all forms of power generation  
 These periods occur as often as periods when the demand for electricity is high  

5  In paragraph 4  the author states that in areas where winds are not steady
 power does not reach all customers
 wind farms cannot be used
 solar power is more appropriate
 backup systems are needed

6  According to paragraph 4  what can be inferred about the problems of visual pollution and noise associated with wind farms  
 Both problems affect the efficiency of wind farms  
 Possible solutions are known for both problems  
 Wind power creates more noise than visual pollution  
 People are more concerned about visual pollution than noise  


7  The phrase  this problem  in the passage refers to

In the future  wind power is likely to become a major source of the world s energy supply 
 	
 	
 	



Answer Choices

 Wind farms have already produced sufficient amounts of electricity to suggest that wind power could become an important source of electric power 
 Wind power has several advantages  such as low pollution and projected cost declines  compared to other energy sources 
 Responding to environmentalists concerned about birds killed by wind turbines  analysts point to other human developments that are even more dangerous to birds 
 The wind energy produced by just a small number of states could supply all of the power needs of the United States 
 Although wind power is not economical in areas with steady winds  alternative wind sources can be used to simulate wind power 
 Smaller countries  which use less electricity than large countries  are especially suited to use wind power to meet all their energy needs

Deer Populations of the Puget Sound
Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States  The black tailed deer  a lowland  west side cousin of the mule deer of eastern Washington  is now the most common  The other species  the Columbian white tailed deer  in earlier times was common in the open prairie country  it is now restricted to the low  marshy islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River  
Nearly any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer s diet  Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants  the black tailed deer browses on huckleberry  salal  dogwood  and almost any other shrub or herb  But this is fair weather feeding  What keeps the black tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy  One compensation for not hibernating is the built in urge to migrate  Deer may move from high elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall  Even with snow on the ground  the high bushy understory is exposed  also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar  hemlock  red alder  and other arboreal fodder  
The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country  The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal  Famous explorers of the North American frontier  Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14  1805  in nearly starved circumstances  They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk  To keep 40 people alive that winter  they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer  And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring  the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation  Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century  when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson s Bay Company  deer populations continued to fluctuate  David Douglas  Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s  found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832  A recent Douglas biographer states   The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone  in 1832   hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops   
Reduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times  A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land  logging  burning  and clearing  eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads  cities  towns  and factories  No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further  Recall the fate of the Columbian white tailed deer  now in a protected status  But for the black tailed deer  human pressure has had just the opposite effect  Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner  1953   in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time  says that  since the early 1940s  the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history  the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320 000 deer  mule and black tailed deer   which will yield about 65 000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period   
The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions  First  the major predators of deer wolves  cougar  and lynx have been greatly reduced in numbers  Second  conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting  But the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests  Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging  fire  or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer  In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse  like huckleberry and vine maple  Arthur Einarsen  longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest  found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive  The protein content of shade grown vegetation  for example  was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings  





1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is true of the white tailed deer of Puget Sound  
 It is native to lowlands and marshes  
 It is more closely related to the mule deer of eastern Washington than to other types of deer  
 It has replaced the black tailed deer in the open prairie  
 It no longer lives in a particular type of habitat that it once occupied  


2  It can be inferred from the discussion in paragraph 2 that winter conditions 
 cause some deer to hibernate 
 make food unavailable in the highlands for deer 
 make it easier for deer to locate understory plants 
 prevent deer from migrating during the winter 

3  The word  inhibits  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 consists of 
 combines 
 restricts 
 establishes 



















4  The phrase  in the same breath  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 impatiently 
 humorously 
 continuously 
 immediately 

5  The author tells the story of the explorers Lewis and Clark in paragraph 3 in order to illustrate which of the following points  
 The number of deer within the Puget Sound region has varied over time  
 Most of the explorers who came to the Puget Sound area were primarily interested in hunting game  
 There was more game for hunting in the East of the United States than in the West  
 Individual explorers were not as successful at locating games as were the trading companies  

6  According to paragraph 3  how had Fort Vancouver changed by the time David Douglas returned in 1832  
 The fort had become the headquarters for the Hudson s Bay Company  
 Deer had begun populating the meadows around the fort  
 Deer populations near the fort had been destroyed  
 Crop yields in the area around the fort had decreased  
















   7  Why does the author ask readers to recall  the fate of the Columbian white tailed deer  in the discussion of changes in the wilderness landscape  
 To provide support for the idea that habitat destruction would lead to population decline
 To compare how two species of deer caused biotic changes in the wilderness environment
 To provide an example of a species of deer that has successfully adapted to human settlement
 To argue that some deer species must be given a protected status

 8  The phrase  indefinite period  in the passage is closest in meaning to period

 that lasts only briefly 
 whose importance remains unknown 

  9  Which of the following statements about deer populations is supported by the information in paragraph 4  
 Deer populations reached their highest point during the 1940s and then began to decline  
 The activities of settlers contributed in unexpected ways to the growth of some deer populations in later times  
 The cleaning of wilderness land for construction caused biotic changes from which the black tailed deer population has never recovered

Deer in the Puget Sound area eat a wide variety of foods and migrate seasonally to find food 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 The balance of deer species in the Puget Sound region has changed over time  with the Columbian white tailed deer now outnumbering other types of deer  
 Deer populations naturally fluctuate  but early settlers in the Puget Sound environment caused an overall decline in the deer populations of the areas at that time  
 In the long term  black tailed deer in the Puget Sound area have benefitted from human activities through the elimination of their natural predators  and more and better food in deforested areas  
 Because Puget Sound deer migrate  it was and still remains difficult to determine accurately how many deer are living at any one time in the western United States  
 Although it was believed that human settlement of the American West would cause the total number of deer to decrease permanently  the opposite has occurred for certain types of deer  
 Wildlife biologists have long been concerned that the loss of forests may create nutritional deficiencies for deer  






























 
Cave Art in Europe

The earliest discovered traces of art are beads and carvings  and then paintings  from sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period  We might expect that early artistic efforts would be crude  but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill  So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa  Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28 000 years ago  which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe  But painting may be even older than that  The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30 000 years ago  and maybe as much as 60 000 years ago  

The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe   1  in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances   2  in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves  and  3  in the inner reaches of caves  whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical religious activities were performed there  

The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals  The paintings rest on bare walls  with no backdrops or environmental trappings  Perhaps  like many contemporary peoples  Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury  and if that were indeed their belief  it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art  Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people sought to improve their luck at hunting  This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures  perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings  But if improving their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the paintings  it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared  Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals  Cave art seems to have reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period  when the herds of game were decreasing  

The particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed  perhaps  by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson  The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides  For example  wild cattle  bovines  and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance  probably because they were larger and heavier  meatier  than other animals in the environment  In addition  the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size  speed  natural weapons such as tusks and horns  and the unpredictability of their behavior  That is  mammoths  bovines  and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer  Thus  the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people  Consistent with this idea  according to the investigators  is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food  But in that period  when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals  because they were becoming extinct   the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals  

Upper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave paintings  Many shafts of spears and similar objects were decorated with figures of animals  The anthropologist Alexander Marshack has an interesting interpretation of some of the engravings made during the Upper Paleolithic  He believes that as far back as 30 000 B C   hunters may have used a system of notation  engraved on bone and stone  to mark phases of the Moon  If this is true  it would mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and were consciously aware of their environment  In addition to other artworks  figurines representing the human female in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper Paleolithic sites  It has been suggested that these figurines were an ideal type or an expression of a desire for fertility

 It is much more than 30 000 years old  


3．The word  principal  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 major

      4．According to paragraph 2  what makes some researchers think that certain cave paintings were connected with magical religious activities  
 The paintings were located where many people could easily see them  allowing groups of people to participate in the magical religious activities  
 Upper Paleolithic people shared similar beliefs with contemporary peoples who use paintings of animals in their magical religious rituals  
 Evidence of magical religious activities has been found in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves  
 The paintings were found in hard to reach places away from the inhabited parts of the cave

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 Upper Paleolithic people  like many contemporary peoples  believed that if they drew a human image in their cave art  it would cause death or injury  
 Many contemporary people believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury  so they  like Upper Paleolithic people  rarely depicted human figures in their cave art  
 If Upper Paleolithic people  like many contemporary peoples  believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury  this belief might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art  
 Although many contemporary peoples believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury  researchers cannot explain why Upper Paleolithic people rarely depicted human figures in their cave art  

7．According to paragraph 3  scholars explained chips in the painted figures of animals by proposing that
 Upper Paleolithic artists used marks to record the animals they had seen 
 the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals for hunting 
 the artists had removed rough spots on the cave walls 
 Upper Paleolithic people used the paintings to increase their luck at hunting

 Hunters did not fear deer and reindeers as much as they did large game animals such as horses and mammoths  
 Hunters were not interested in hunting deer and reindeer because of their size and speed  
 Hunters preferred the meat and hides of deer and reindeer to those of other animals  
 Hunters avoided deer and reindeer because of their natural weapons  such as horns  
11．According to paragraph 4  what change is evident in the art of the period following the Upper Paleolithic  
 This new art starts to depict small animals rather than large ones  
 This new art ceases to reflect the ways in which people obtained their food  
 This new art no longer consists mostly of representations of animals  
 This new art begins to show the importance of hunting to the economy  

12．According to paragraph 5  which of the following has been used as evidence to suggest that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and conscious awareness of their environment  
 They engraved animal figures on the shafts of spears and other objects  
 They may have used engraved signs to record the phases of the Moon  
 Their figurines represented the human female in exaggerated form  
 They may have used figurines to portray an ideal type or to express a desire for fertility

Answer choices

 Researchers have proposed several different explanations for the fact that animals were the most common subjects in the cave paintings  
 The art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic ceased to portray large game animals and focused instead on the kinds of animals that people of that period preferred to hunt  
 Some researchers believe that the paintings found in France provide more explicit evidence of their symbolic significance than those found in Spain  southern Africa  and Australia  
 The cave paintings focus on portraying animals without also depicting the natural environments in which these animals are typically found  
 Some researchers have argued that the cave paintings mostly portrayed large animals that provided Upper Paleolithic people with meat and materials  
 Besides cave paintings  Upper Paleolithic people produced several other kinds of artwork  one of which has been thought to provide evidence of complex thought  







 
Petroleum Resources

Petroleum  consisting of crude oil and natural gas  seems to originate from organic matter in marine sediment  Microscopic organisms settle to the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud  The organic matter may partially decompose  using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment  As soon as the oxygen is gone  decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved  

Continued sedimentation the process of deposits  settling on the sea bottom buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures  which convert the organic matter to oil and gas  As muddy sediments are pressed together  the gas and small droplets of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy layers nearby  Over long periods of time  millions of years   accumulations of gas and oil can collect in the sandy layers  Both oil and gas are less dense than water  so they generally tend to rise upward through water saturated rock and sediment  

Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations of oil  and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools  When an oil pool or field has been discovered  wells are drilled into the ground  Permanent towers  called derricks  used to be built to handle the long sections of drilling pipe  Now portable drilling machines are set up and are then dismantled and removed  When the well reaches a pool  oil usually rises up the well because of its density difference with water beneath it or because of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it  Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today  spouts of oil  or gushers  were common in the past  Gas pressure gradually dies out  and oil is pumped from the well  Water or steam may be pumped down adjacent wells to help push the oil out  At a refinery  the crude oil from underground is separated into natural gas  gasoline  kerosene  and various oils  Petrochemicals such as dyes  fertilizer  and plastic are also manufactured from the petroleum  

As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find  the search for it is extended into more hostile environments  The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries  Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean s continental shelves those gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents  More than one quarter of the world s oil and almost one fifth of the world s natural gas come from offshore  even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land  A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway  

Of course  there is far more oil underground than can be recovered  It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling  Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden  such as national parks or other public lands  Even given the best extraction techniques  only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface  The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground  

Moreover  getting petroleum out of the ground and from under the sea and to the consumer can create environmental problems anywhere along the line  Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or landslides  causing serious oil spills  Spillage from huge oil carrying cargo ships  called tankers  involved in collisions or accidental groundings  such as the one off Alaska in 1989  can create oil slicks at sea  Offshore platforms may also lose oil  creating oil slicks that drift ashore and foul the beaches  harming the environment  Sometimes  the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is removed  The Wilmington field near Long Beach  California  has subsided nine meters in 50 years  protective barriers have had to be built to prevent seawater from flooding the area  Finally  the refining and burning of petroleum and its products can cause air pollution  Advancing technology and strict laws  however  are helping control some of these adverse environmental effects

 Petroleum  is a broad term that includes both crude oil and natural gas 
 
 
 




Answer choices

 Petroleum formation is the result of biological as well as chemical activity  
 The difficulty of finding adequate sources of oil on land has resulted in a greater number of offshore drilling sites  
 Petroleum extraction can have a negative impact on the environment  
 Petroleum tends to rise to the surface  since it is lower in density than water  
 Current methods of petroleum extraction enable oil producers to recover about half of the world s petroleum reserves  
 Accidents involving oil tankers occur when tankers run into shore reefs or collide with other vessels

Meteorite Impact and Dinosaur Extinction
There is increasing evidence that the impacts of meteorites have had important effects on Earth  particularly in the field of biological evolution  Such impacts continue to pose a natural hazard to life on Earth  Twice in the twentieth century  large meteorite objects are known to have collided with Earth 
If an impact is large enough  it can disturb the environment of the entire Earth and cause an ecological catastrophe  The best documented such impact took place 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period of geological history  This break in Earth s history is marked by a mass extinction  when as many as half the species on the planet became extinct  While there are a dozen or more mass extinctions in the geological record  the Cretaceous mass extinction has always intrigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the age of the dinosaurs  For tens of millions of years  those great creatures had flourished  Then  suddenly  they disappeared  
The body that impacted Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period was a meteorite with a mass of more than a trillion tons and a diameter of at least 10 kilometers  Scientists first identified this impact in 1980 from the worldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after the impact  This sediment layer is enriched in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively abundant in a meteorite but very rare in the crust of Earth  Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater  this component of meteorites is easily identified  By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucat region of Mexico  The crater  now deeply buried in sediment  was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter  
This impact released an enormous amount of energy  excavating a crater about twice as large as the lunar crater Tycho  The explosion lifted about 100 trillion tons of dust into the atmosphere  as can be determined by measuring the thickness of the sediment layer formed when this dust settled to the surface  Such a quantity of material would have blocked the sunlight completely from reaching the surface  plunging Earth into a period of cold and darkness that lasted at least several months  The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth  starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland  Presumably  those environmental disasters could have been responsible for the mass extinction  including the death of the dinosaurs 
Several other mass extinctions in the geological record have been tentatively identified with large impacts  but none is so dramatic as the Cretaceous event  But even without such specific documentation  it is clear that impacts of this size do occur and that their results can be catastrophic  What is a catastrophe for one group of living things  however  may create opportunities for another group  Following each mass extinction  there is a sudden evolutionary burst as new species develop to fill the ecological niches opened by the event 
Impacts by meteorites represent one mechanism that could cause global catastrophes and seriously influence the evolution of life all over the planet  According to some estimates  the majority of all extinctions of species may be due to such impacts  Such a perspective fundamentally changes our view of biological evolution  The standard criterion for the survival of a species is its success in competing with other species and adapting to slowly changing environments  Yet an equally important criterion is the ability of a species to survive random global ecological catastrophes due to impacts  
Earth is a target in a cosmic shooting gallery  subject to random violent events that were unsuspected a few decades ago  In 1991 the United States Congress asked NASA to investigate the hazard posed today by large impacts on Earth  The group conducting the study concluded from a detailed analysis that impacts from meteorites can indeed be hazardous  Although there is always some risk that a large impact could occur  careful study shows that this risk is quite small

 present

2  In paragraph 2  why does the author include the information that dinosaurs had flourished for tens of millions of years and then suddenly disappeared 
 To support the claim that the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous is the best documented of the dozen or so mass extinctions in the geological record
 To explain why as many as half of the species on Earth at the time are believed to have become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous
 To explain why paleontologists have always been intrigued by the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous
 To provide evidence that an impact can be large enough to disturb the environment of the entire planet and cause an ecological disaster


3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the location of the meteorite impact in Mexico  
 The location of the impact site in Mexico was kept secret by geologists from 1980 to 1990 
 It was a well known fact that the impact had occurred in the Yucat region 
 Geologists knew that there had been an impact before they knew where it had occurred 
 The Yucat region was chosen by geologists as the most probable impact site because of its climate 

4  According to paragraph 3  how did scientists determine that a large meteorite had impacted Earth 
 They discovered a large crater in the Yucat region of Mexico 
 They found a unique layer of sediment worldwide 
 They were alerted by archaeologists who had been excavating in the Yucat region 
 They located a meteorite with a mass of over a trillion tons

10  Paragraph 6 supports which of the following statements about the factors that are essential for the survival of a species 
 The most important factor for the survival of a species is its ability to compete and adapt to gradual changes in its environment 
 The ability of a species to compete and adapt to a gradually changing environment is not the only ability that is essential for survival 
 Since most extinctions of species are due to major meteorite impacts  the ability to survive such impacts is the most important factor for the survival of a species 
 The factors that are most important for the survival of a species vary significantly from one species to another

Scientists have linked the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous with a meteorite impact on Earth 
 
 
 

Answer choices

 Scientists had believed for centuries that meteorite activity influenced evolution on Earth 
 An iridium enriched sediment layer and a large impact crater in the Yucat provide evidence that a large meteorite struck Earth about 65 million years ago 
 The site of the large meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous period was identified in 1990 
 Large meteorite impacts  such as one at the end of the Cretaceous period  can seriously affect climate  ecological niches  plants  and animals 
 There have also been large meteorite impacts on the surface of the Moon  leaving craters like Tycho 
 Meteorite impacts can be advantageous for some species  which thrive  and disastrous for other species  which become extinct 












TPO 5
Minerals and Plants
Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants for normal growth and development  The soil is the source of these minerals  which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil  Even nitrogen  which is a gas in its elemental state  is normally absorbed from the soil as nitrate ions  Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro nutrients and are therefore unable to support most plant life  So called serpentine soils  for example  are deficient in calcium  and only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can survive  In modern agriculture  mineral depletion of soils is a major concern  since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil 
Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms such as chlorosis  loss of chlorophyll resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue   necrosis  isolated dead patches   anthocyanin formation  development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or stem   stunted growth  and development of woody tissue in an herbaceous plant  Soils are most commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus  Nitrogen deficient plants exhibit many of the symptoms just described  Leaves develop chlorosis  stems are short and slender  and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems  petioles  and lower leaf surfaces  Phosphorus deficient plants are often stunted  with leaves turning a characteristic dark green  often with the accumulation of anthocyanin  Typically  older leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue  Iron deficiency is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves 
Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically  that is  in soilless liquid nutrient solutions  This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants  Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research  since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter  Aeroponics  a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution  is another method for growing plants without soil 
While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants  an overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth  Saline soils  which have high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts  limit plant growth  and research continues to focus on developing salt tolerant varieties of agricultural crops  Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  mercury  and aluminum  however  even copper and zinc  which are essential elements  can become toxic in high concentrations  Although most plants cannot survive in these soils  certain plants have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals 
Scientists have known for some time that certain plants  called hyperaccumulators  can concentrate minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal  A survey of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel  cobalt  copper  zinc  manganese  lead  and cadmium are other minerals of choice  Hyperaccumulators run the entire range of the plant world  They may be herbs  shrubs  or trees  Many members of the mustard family  spurge family  legume family  and grass family are top hyperaccumulators  Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world  where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may afford some protection against plant eating insects and microbial pathogens 
Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals–an environmentally friendly approach known as phytoremediation  This scenario begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating species in the target area  such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff  Toxic minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem and leaves  A harvest of the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the metal for industrial uses  After several years of cultivation and harvest  the site would be restored at a cost much lower than the price of excavation and reburial  the standard practice for remediation of contaminated soils  For examples  in field trials  the plant alpine pennycress removed zinc and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter  and Indian mustard  native to Pakistan and India  has been effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils 

1  According to paragraph 1  what is true of plants that can grow in serpentine soil

10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Before considering phytoremediation  hyperaccumulating species of plants local to the target area must be identified 
 The investigation begins with an evaluation of toxic sites in the target area to determine the extent of contamination 
 The first step in phytoremediation is the planting of hyperaccumulating plants in the area to be cleaned up 
 Mines and irrigation ponds can be kept from becoming contaminated by planting hyperaccumulating species in targeted areas 

11  It can be inferred from paragraph 6 that compared with standard practices for remediation of contaminated soils  phytoremediation

Plants need to absorb certain minerals from the soil in adequate quantities for normal growth and development 
 
 
 




Answer Choices

 Some plants are able to accumulate extremely high levels of certain minerals and thus can be used to clean up soils contaminated with toxic levels of these minerals 
 Though beneficial in lower levels  high levels of salts  other minerals  and heavy metals can be harmful to plants 
 When plants do not absorb sufficient amounts of essential minerals  characteristic abnormalities result 
 Because high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts limit growth in most plants  much research has been done in an effort to develop salt tolerant agricultural crops 
 Some plants can tolerate comparatively low levels of certain minerals  but such plants are of little use for recycling nutrients back into depleted soils 
 Mineral deficiencies in many plants can be cured by misting their roots with a nutrient solution or by transferring the plants to a soilless nutrient solution 





















 
The Origin of the Pacific Island People
The greater Pacific region  traditionally called Oceania  consists of three cultural areas  Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia  Melanesia  in the southwest Pacific  contains the large islands of New Guinea  the Solomons  Vanuatu  and New Caledonia  Micronesia  the area north of Melanesia  consists primarily of small scattered islands  Polynesia is the central Pacific area in the great triangle defined by Hawaii  Easter Island  and New Zealand  Before the arrival of Europeans  the islands in the two largest cultural areas  Polynesia and Micronesia  together contained a population estimated at 700 000 
Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them  in the absence of solid linguistic  archaeological  and biological data  many fanciful and mutually exclusive theories were devised  Pacific islanders are variously thought to have come from North America  South America  Egypt  Israel  and India  as well as Southeast Asia  Many older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and overall cultural creativity of the Pacific islanders  For example  British anthropologists G  Elliot Smith and W  J  Perry assumed that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize the Pacific  They inferred that the Egyptians even crossed the Pacific to found the great civilizations of the New World  North and South America   In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a balsa log raft westward with the winds and currents across the Pacific from South America to prove his theory that Pacific islanders were Native Americans  also called American Indians   Later Heyerdahl suggested that the Pacific was peopled by three migrations  by Native Americans from the Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii  by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island  and by Melanesians  In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian style reed boat to prove Egyptian influences in the Americas  Contrary to these theorists  the overwhelming evidence of physical anthropology  linguistics  and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came from Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the prevailing winds and currents 
The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of the Pacific islands include the appropriate boat building  sailing  and navigation skills to get to the islands in the first place  domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions  and a varied inventory of fishing implements and techniques  It is now generally believed that these prerequisites originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages  a group of several hundred related languages  and began to emerge in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B C E  The culture of that time  based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction  is assumed to have had a broad inventory of cultivated plants including taro  yarns  banana  sugarcane  breadfruit  coconut  sago  and rice  Just as important  the culture also possessed the basic foundation for an effective maritime adaptation  including outrigger canoes and a variety of fishing techniques that could be effective for overseas voyaging 
Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the pacific was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift  it seems reasonable that this feat was accomplished by deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and domesticated plants and animals  Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific  These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and political dynamics on the home islands  as well as the challenge and excitement of exploring unknown waters   
Because all Polynesians  Micronesians  and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia  all these peoples most certainly derived from that region and not the New World or elsewhere  The undisputed pre Columbian presence in Oceania of the sweet potato  which is a New World domesticate  has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl s  American Indians in the Pacific  theories  However  this is one plant out of a long list of Southeast Asian domesticates  As Patrick Kirch  an American anthropologist  points out  rather than being brought by rafting South Americans  sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning Polynesian navigators who could have reached the west coast of South America 



1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true statements about Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia EXCEPT 
 Collectively  these regions are traditionally known as Oceania 
 These islands of Micronesia are small and spread out 
 Hawaii  Easter Island  and New Zealand mark the boundaries of Polynesia 
 Melanesia is situated to the north of Micronesia 


2  By stating that the theories are  mutually exclusive  the author means that
 if one of the theories is true  then all the others must be false
 the differences between the theories are unimportant
 taken together  the theories cover all possibilities
 the theories support each other

3  The word  overwhelming  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 powerful
 favorable
 current 
 reasonable






4  According to paragraph 2  which of the following led some early researchers to believe that the Pacific islanders originally came from Egypt 
 Egyptians were known to have founded other great civilizations 
 Sailors from other parts of the world were believed to lack the skills needed to travel across the ocean 
 Linguistic  archaeological  and biological data connected the islands to Egypt 
 Egyptian accounts claimed responsibility for colonizing the Pacific as well as the Americas 

5  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about early theories of where the first inhabitants of the Pacific islands came from 
 They were generally based on solid evidence 
 They tried to account for the origin of the characteristic features of the languages spoken by Pacific islanders 
 They assumed that the peoples living in Southeast Asia did not have the skills needed to sail to the Pacific islands 
 They questioned the ideas of G  Elliot Smith and W  J  Perry

7  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as required for successful colonization of the Pacific islands EXCEPT
 knowledge of various Austronesian languages
 a variety of fishing techniques
 navigational skills
 knowledge of plant cultivation

8  In paragraph 3  why does the author provide information about the types of crops grown and boats used in Southeast Asia during the period around 5000 B  C  E  
 To evaluate the relative importance of agriculture and fishing to early Austronesian peoples
 To illustrate the effectiveness of archaeological and linguistic methods in discovering details about life in ancient times
 To contrast living conditions on the continent of Asia with living conditions on the Pacific islands
 To demonstrate that people from this region had the skills and resources necessary to travel to and survive on the Pacific islands


9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Some people have argued that the Pacific was settled by traders who became lost while transporting domesticated plants and animals 
 The original Polynesian settlers were probably marooned on the islands  but they may have been joined later by carefully prepared colonization expeditions 
 Although it seems reasonable to believe that colonization expeditions would set out fully stocked  this is contradicted by much of the evidence 
 The settlement of the Pacific islands was probably intentional and well planned rather than accidental as some people have proposed

11  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is NOT an explanation for why a group of people might have wanted to colonize the Pacific islands 
 As their numbers increased  they needed additional territory 
 The winds and currents made the islands easy to reach 
 The political situation at home made emigration desirable 
 They found exploration challenging and exciting 

12  Why does the author mention the views of  Patrick Kirch  
 To present evidence in favor of Heyerdahl s idea about American Indians reaching Oceania
 To emphasize the familiarity of Pacific islanders with crops from many different regions of the world
 To indicate that supposed proof for Heyerdahl s theory has an alternative explanation
 To demonstrate that some of the same crops were cultivated in both South America and Oceania

Together  Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia make up the region described as the Pacific islands  or Oceania 
 
 
 
Answer Choices

 The first Europeans to reach the area assumed that the islands  original inhabitants must have drifted to Oceania  perhaps from Egypt or the Americas 
 It is now believed that the process of colonization required a great deal of skill  determination  and planning and could not have happened by chance 
 Using linguistic and archaeological evidence  anthropologists have determined that the first Pacific islanders were Austronesian people from Southeast Asia 
 New evidence suggests that  rather than being isolated  Pacific islanders engaged in trade and social interaction with peoples living in Southeast Asia 
 Although early colonizers of the islands probably came from agriculture based societies  they were obliged to adopt an economy based on fishing 
 Computer simulations of the winds and currents in the Pacific have shown that reaching the Pacific islands was probably much easier than previously thought 




 
The Cambrian Explosion
The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and biological events  including the origin of Earth about 4 6 billion years ago  the origin of life about 3 5 billion years ago  the origin of eukaryotic life forms  living things that have cells with true nuclei  about 1 5 billion years ago  and the origin of animals about 0 6 billion years ago  The last event marks the beginning of the Cambrian period  Animals originated relatively late in the history of Earth in only the last 10 percent of Earth s history  During a geologically brief 100 million year period  all modern animal groups  along with other animals that are now extinct  evolved  This rapid origin and diversification of animals is often referred to as  the Cambrian explosion  
Scientists have asked important questions about this explosion for more than a century  Why did it occur so late in the history of Earth  The origin of multicellular forms of life seems a relatively simple step compared to the origin of life itself  Why does the fossil record not document the series of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals  Why did animal life evolve so quickly  Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these questions 
One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils during this important 100 million year period is that early animals were soft bodied and simply did not fossilize  Fossilization of soft bodied animals is less likely than fossilization of hard bodied animals  but it does occur  Conditions that promote fossilization of soft bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create an environment that discourages decomposition  In fact  fossil beds containing soft bodied animals have been known for many years  
The Ediacara fossil formation  which contains the oldest known animal fossils  consists exclusively of soft bodied forms  Although named after a site in Australia  the Ediacara formation is worldwide in distribution and dates to Precambrian times  This 700 million year old formation gives few clues to the origins of modern animals  however  because paleontologists believe it represents an evolutionary experiment that failed  It contains no ancestors of modern animal groups 
A slightly younger fossil formation containing animal remains is the Tommotian formation  named after a locale in Russia  It dates to the very early Cambrian period  and it also contains only soft bodied forms  At one time  the animals present in these fossil beds were assigned to various modern animal groups  but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils represent unique body forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and disappeared before the end of the period  leaving no descendants in modern animal groups 
A third fossil formation containing both soft bodied and hard bodied animals provides evidence of the result of the Cambrian explosion  This fossil formation  called the Burgess Shale  is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia  Shortly after the Cambrian explosion  mud slides rapidly buried thousands of marine animals under conditions that favored fossilization  These fossil beds provide evidence of about 32 modern animal groups  plus about 20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be assigned to any one of the modern groups  These unassignable animals include a large swimming predator called Anomalocaris and a soft bodied animal called Wiwaxia  which ate detritus or algae  The Burgess Shale formation also has fossils of many extinct representatives of modern animal groups  For example  a well known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a representative of a previously unknown group of arthropods  a category of animals that includes insects  spiders  mites  and crabs  
Fossil formations like the Burgess Shale show that evolution cannot always be thought of as a slow progression  The Cambrian explosion involved rapid evolutionary diversification  followed by the extinction of many unique animals  Why was this evolution so rapid  No one really knows  Many zoologists believe that it was because so many ecological niches were available with virtually no competition from existing species  Will zoologists ever know the evolutionary sequences in the Cambrian explosion  Perhaps another ancient fossil bed of soft bodied animals from 600 million year old seas is awaiting discovery

 Why was the origin of life a simple step in Earth s history 
 Why did it take so long for multicellular organisms to develop 
 Why did animal life evolve so rapidly 
 Why does the fossil record lack evidence of animal evolution during that time

 It contains fossils that date back to the Precambrian period 
 It contains only soft bodied animal fossils 
 It is located on a single site in Australia 
 It does not contain any fossils of the ancestors of modern animals 



9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 The animals found in the Tommotian fossil bed were once thought to belong to a variety of modern animal groups  but now they are thought to have descended from a single group 
 Animals in the Tommotian fossil beds were initially assigned to modern animal groups but are now thought to belong to groups that emerged and died out during the Cambrian period 
 Though at first they thought otherwise  paleontologists now agree that the animals in the Tommotian have body forms from which modern animals have descended 
 It is unclear whether the Tommotian fossils from the early Cambrian period represent unique body forms or whether they should be assigned to various modern animal groups 





10  Why does the author mention  Anomalocans  and  Wiwaxia  
 To contrast predators with animals that eat plants such as algae
 To question the effects of rapid mud slides on fossilization
 To suggest that much is still unknown about animals found in the Burgess Shale
 To provide examples of fossils that cannot be assigned to a modern animal group

11   Sidneyia  is an example of 
 a relative of Anomalocaris and Wiwaxia
 a previously unknown Burgess Shale animal
 an extinct member of a currently existing category of animals
 an animal that cannot be assigned to any modern animal group


12  What can be inferred from paragraph 7 about why the Cambrian explosion is so unusual 
 It generated new ecological niches through the extinction of many unique animals 
 It was a period of rapid evolution  and evolution is often thought of as a slow process 
 It is a period whose evolutionary sequences are clearly marked 
 It generated a very large number of ancient fossil beds containing soft bodied animals

The term  Cambrian explosion  refers to the geologically brief period during which all modern animal groups evolved 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Little is known about the stages of evolution during the Cambrian period  in part because early animals were soft bodied and could fossilize only under particular conditions 
 While animal fossils from before the Cambrian explosion have no modern descendants  many animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion can be assigned to modern groups 
 The Cambrian period is significant because it marks the emergence of eukaryotic life forms organisms that have cells with true nuclei 
 The Ediacara fossil formation provides the most information about the Cambrian explosion  while the earlier  Tommotian and Burgess Shale formations give clues about Precambrian evolution 
 Zoologists are awaiting the discovery of a 600 million year old fossil formation in order to be able to form a theory of how animal evolution progressed 
 Although the reasons for the rapid evolution of animals during the Cambrian period are not known  one proposed explanation is an abundance of niches with a lack of competitors

Powering the Industrial Revolution
In Britain one of the most dramatic changes of the Industrial Revolution was the harnessing of power  Until the reign of George Ⅲ 1760 1820   available sources of power for work and travel had not increased since the Middle Ages  There were three sources of power  animal or human muscles  the wind  operating on sail or windmill  and running water  Only the last of these was suited at all to the continuous operating of machines  and although waterpower abounded in Lancashire and Scotland and ran grain mills as well as textile mills  it had one great disadvantage  streams flowed where nature intended them to  and water driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was desirable for other reasons  Furthermore  even the most reliable waterpower varied with the seasons and disappeared in a drought  The new age of machinery  in short  could not have been born without a new source of both movable and constant power 

The source had long been known but not exploited  Early in the eighteenth century  a pump had come into use in which expanding steam raised a piston in a cylinder  and atmospheric pressure brought it down again when the steam condensed inside the cylinder to form a vacuum  This  atmospheric engine   invented by Thomas Savery and vastly improved by his partner  Thomas Newcomen  embodied revolutionary principles  but it was so slow and wasteful of fuel that it could not be employed outside the coal mines for which it had been designed  In the 1760s  James Watt perfected a separate condenser for the steam  so that the cylinder did not have to be cooled at every stroke  then he devised a way to make the piston turn a wheel and thus convert reciprocating  back and forth  motion into rotary motion  He thereby transformed an inefficient pump of limited use into a steam engine of a thousand uses  The final step came when steam was introduced into the cylinder to drive the piston backward as well as forward  thereby increasing the speed of the engine and cutting its fuel consumption 

Watt s steam engine soon showed what it could do  It liberated industry from dependence on running water  The engine eliminated water in the mines by driving efficient pumps  which made possible deeper and deeper mining  The ready availability of coal inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to develop the first new form of nighttime illumination to be discovered in a millennium and a half  Coal gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles  and early in the new century  well to do Londoners grew accustomed to gaslit houses and even streets  Iron manufacturers  which had starved for fuel while depending on charcoal  also benefited from ever increasing supplies of coal  blast furnaces with steam powered bellows turned out more iron and steel for the new machinery  Steam became the motive force of the Industrial Revolution as coal and iron ore were the raw materials 

By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in the British Isles  and Britain retained a virtual monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s  Steam power did not merely spin cotton and roll iron  early in the new century  it also multiplied ten times over the amount of paper that a single worker could produce in a day  At the same time  operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than thirty  Steam also promised to eliminate a transportation problem not fully solved by either canal boats or turnpikes  Boats could carry heavy weights  but canals could not cross hilly terrain  turnpikes could cross the hills  but the roadbeds could not stand up under   great weights  These problems needed still another solution  and the ingredients for it lay close at hand  In some industrial regions  heavily laden wagons  with flanged wheels  were being hauled by horses along metal rails  and the stationary steam engine was puffing in the factory and mine  Another generation passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients  by putting the engine on wheels and the wheels on the rails  so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse  Thus the railroad age sprang from what had already happened in the eighteenth century 


1  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information．
 Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously  but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland  most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven 
  The disadvantage of using waterpower is that streams do not necessarily flow in places that are the most suitable for factories  which explains why so many water powered grain and textile mills were located in undesirable places 
  Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant  grain and textile mills  as well as other factories  tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotland 
  Running water was the only source of power that was suitable for the continuous operation of machines  but to make use of it  factories had to be located where the water was  regardless of whether such locations made sense otherwise

William Smith

In 1769 in a little town in Oxfordshire  England  a child with the very ordinary name of William Smith was born into the poor family of a village blacksmith  He received rudimentary village schooling  but mostly he roamed his uncle s farm collecting the fossils that were so abundant in the rocks of the Cotswold Hills  When he grew older  William Smith taught himself surveying from books he bought with his small savings  and at the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a surveyor of the local parish  He then proceeded to teach himself geology  and when he was twenty four  he went to work for the company that was excavating the Somerset Coal Canal in the south of England 

This was before the steam locomotive  and canal building was at its height  The companies building the canals to transport coal needed surveyors to help them find the coal deposits worth mining as well as to determine the best courses for the canals  This job gave Smith an opportunity to study the fresh rock outcrops created by the newly dug canal  He later worked on similar jobs across the length and breadth of England  all the while studying the newly revealed strata and collecting all the fossils he could find  Smith used mail coaches to travel as much as 10 000 miles per year  In 1815 he published the first modern geological map   A Map of the Strata of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland   a map so meticulously researched that it can still be used today 

In 1831 when Smith was finally recognized by the Geological Society of London as the  father of English geology   it was not only for his maps but also for something even more important  Ever since people had begun to catalog the strata in particular outcrops  there had been the hope that these could somehow be used to calculate geological time  But as more and more accumulations of strata were cataloged in more and more places  it became clear that the sequences of rocks sometimes differed from region to region and that no rock type was ever going to become a reliable time marker throughout the world  Even without the problem of regional differences  rocks present a difficulty as unique time markers  Quartz is quartz a silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions there s no difference at all between two million year old Pleistocene quartz and Cambrian quartz created over 500 million years ago 

As he collected fossils from strata throughout England  Smith began to see that the fossils told a different story from the rocks  Particularly in the younger strata  the rocks were often so similar that he had trouble distinguishing the strata  but he never had trouble telling the fossils apart  While rock between two consistent strata might in one place be shale and in another sandstone  the fossils in that shale or sandstone were always the same  Some fossils endured through so many millions of years that they appear in many strata  but others occur only in a few strata  and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum  Fossils are thus identifying markers for particular periods in Earth s history 

Not only could Smith identify rock strata by the fossils they contained  he could also see a pattern emerging  certain fossils always appear in more ancient sediments  while others begin to be seen as the strata become more recent  By following the fossils  Smith was able to put all the strata of England s earth into relative temporal sequence  About the same time  Georges Cuvier made the same discovery while studying the rocks around Paris  

Soon it was realized that this principle of faunal  animal  succession was valid not only in England or France but virtually everywhere  It was actually a principle of floral succession as well  because plants showed the same transformation through time as did fauna  Limestone may be found in the Cambrian or 300 million years later in the Jurassic strata  but a trilobite the ubiquitous marine arthropod that had its birth in the Cambrian will never be found in Jurassic strata  nor a dinosaur in the Cambrian

 Smith learned surveying by reading and by apprenticing for a local surveyor 
 Smith s family lived in a small English town and possessed little wealth 
 Smith learned about fossils from books he borrowed from his uncle 
 Smith eventually left his village to work on the excavation of an English canal 



3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about canal building 
  Canals were built primarily in the south of England rather than in other regions 
 Canal building decreased after the steam locomotive was invented 
  Canal building made it difficult to study rock strata which often became damaged in the process 
  Canal builders hired surveyors like Smith to examine exposed rock strata

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 The discovery of regional differences in the sequences of rocks led geologists to believe that rock types could someday become reliable time markers 
 Careful analysis of strata revealed that rocks cannot establish geological time because the pattern of rock layers varies from place to place 
 Smith s catalogs of rock strata indicated that the sequences of rocks are different from place to place and from region to region 
 Because people did not catalog regional differences in sequences of rocks  it was believed that rocks could never be reliable time markers 
7  Why does the author use the phrase  Quartz is quartz  
 To describe how the differences between Pleistocene and Cambrian quartz reveal information about dating rocks
 To point out that the chemical composition of quartz makes it more difficult to date than other rocks
 To provide an example of how regional differences in rock sequences can make a particular rock difficult to date
 To explain that rocks are difficult to use for dating because their chemical compositions always remain the same over time


8  According to paragraph 4  it was difficult for Smith to distinguish rock strata because
 the rocks from different strata closely resembled each other
 he was often unable to find fossils in the younger rock strata
 their similarity to each other made it difficult for him to distinguish one rock type from another
 the type of rock between two consistent strata was always the same

Infantile Amnesia
What do you remember about your life before you were three  Few people can remember anything that happened to them in their early years  Adults  memories of the next few years also tend to be scanty  Most people remember only a few events usually ones that were meaningful and distinctive  such as being hospitalized or a sibling s birth  
How might this inability to recall early experiences be explained  The sheer passage of time does not account for it  adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier  Another seemingly plausible explanation that infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development also is incorrect  Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year  and eleven month olds remember some events a year later  Nor does the hypothesis that infantile amnesia reflects repression or holding back of sexually charged episodes explain the phenomenon  While such repression may occur  people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either 
Three other explanations seem more promising  One involves physiological changes relevant to memory  Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues throughout early childhood  and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved later  Demonstrations of infants  and toddlers  long term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier  such as reaching in the dark for objects  putting a bottle in a doll s mouth  or pulling apart two pieces of a toy  The brain s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories  but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions  
A second explanation involves the influence of the social world on children s language use  Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will endure into later childhood and adulthood  Through hearing stories with a clear beginning  middle  and ending children may learn to extract the gist of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later  Consistent with this view  parents and children increasingly engage in discussions of past events when children are about three years old  However  hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger children to form enduring memories  Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long lasting verbalizable memories 
A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it  Whether people can remember an event depends critically on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempt to retrieve it  The better able the person is to reconstruct the perspective from which the material was encoded  the more likely that recall will be successful  
This view is supported by a variety of factors that can create mismatches between very young children s encoding and older children s and adults  retrieval efforts  The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it  Older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw  but infants would not have encoded the information verbally  General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor s office helps older individuals encode their experiences  but again  infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures 
These three explanations of infantile amnesia are not mutually exclusive  indeed  they support each other  Physiological immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely enduring memories  even when they hear stories that promote such remembering in preschoolers  Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can access as adults  Conversely  improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events  Thus  all three explanations physiological maturation  hearing and producing stories about past events  and improved encoding of key aspects of events seem likely to be involved in overcoming infantile amnesia 



1  What purpose does paragraph 2 serve in the larger discussion of children s inability to recall early experiences  
 To argue that theories that are not substantiated by evidence should generally be considered unreliable
 To argue that the hypotheses mentioned in paragraph 2 have been more thoroughly researched than have the theories mentioned later in the passage
 To explain why some theories about infantile amnesia are wrong before presenting ones more likely to be true

 The ability to recall an event decreases as the time after the event increases 
 Young children are not capable of forming memories that last for more than a short time 
 People may hold back sexually meaningful memories 
 Most events in childhood are too ordinary to be worth remembering 




5  What does paragraph 3 suggest about long term memory in children 
 Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important for the long term memory of motor activities but not verbal descriptions 
 Young children may form long term memories of actions they see earlier than of things they hear or are told 
 Young children have better long term recall of short verbal exchanges than of long ones 
 Children s long term recall of motor activities increases when such activities are accompanied by explicit verbal descriptions 





6  According to paragraph 4  what role may storytelling play in forming childhood memories

9  The phrase  This view  in the passage refers to the belief that 
 the ability to retrieve a memory partly depends on the similarity between the encoding and retrieving process
 the process of encoding information is less complex for adults than it is for young adults and infants
 infants and older children are equally dependent on discussion of past events for the retrieval of information
 infants encode information in the same way older children and adults do

 It argues that particular theories discussed earlier in the passage require further research 
 It explains how particular theories discussed earlier in the passage may work in combination

The Geologic History of the Mediterranean

In 1970 geologists Kenneth J  Hsu and William B F  Ryan were collecting research data while aboard the oceanographic research vessel Glomar Challenger  An objective of this particular cruise was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean and to resolve questions about its geologic history  One question was related to evidence that the invertebrate fauna  animals without spines  of the Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6 million years ago  Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out  although a few hardy species survived  A few managed to migrate into the Atlantic  Somewhat later  the migrants returned  bringing new species with them  Why did the near extinction and migrations occur 

Another task for the Glomar Challenger s scientists was to try to determine the origin of the domelike masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean seafloor  These structures had been detected years earlier by echo sounding instruments  but they had never been penetrated in the course of drilling  Were they salt domes such as are common along the United States Gulf Coast  and if so  why should there have been so much solid crystalline salt beneath the floor of the Mediterranean  

With question such as these clearly before them  the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the Mediterranean to search for the answers  On August 23  1970  they recovered a sample  The sample consisted of pebbles of hardened sediment that had once been soft  deep sea mud  as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock  Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent  In the days following  samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor  Furthermore  the gypsum was found to possess peculiarities of composition and structure that suggested it had formed on desert flats  Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils  indicating open ocean conditions  As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin  the scientists took solid  shiny  crystalline salt from the core barrel  Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt 

The time had come to formulate a hypothesis  The investigators theorized that about 20 million years ago  the Mediterranean was a broad seaway linked to the Atlantic by two narrow straits  Crustal movements closed the straits  and the landlocked Mediterranean began to evaporate  Increasing salinity caused by the evaporation resulted in the extermination of scores of invertebrate species  Only a few organisms especially tolerant of very salty conditions remained  As evaporation continued  the remaining brine  salt water  became so dense that the calcium sulfate of the hard layer was precipitated  In the central deeper part of the basin  the last of the brine evaporated to precipitate more soluble sodium chloride  salt   Later  under the weight of overlying sediments  this salt flowed plastically upward to form salt domes  Before this happened  however  the Mediterranean was a vast desert 3 000 meters deep  Then  about 5 5 million years ago came the deluge  As a result of crustal adjustments and faulting  the Strait of Gibraltar  where the Mediterranean now connects to the Atlantic  opened  and water cascaded spectacularly back into the Mediterranean  Turbulent waters tore into the hardened salt flats  broke them up  and ground them into the pebbles observed in the first sample taken by the Challenger  As the basin was refilled  normal marine organisms returned  Soon layer of oceanic ooze began to accumulate above the old hard layer 
The salt and gypsum  the faunal changes  and the unusual gravel provided abundant evidence that the Mediterranean was once a desert

Ancient Rome and Greece
There is a quality of cohesiveness about the Roman world that applied neither to Greece nor perhaps to any other civilization  ancient or modern  Like the stone of Roman wall  which were held together both by the regularity of the design and by that peculiarly powerful Roman cement  so the various parts of the Roman realm were bonded into a massive  monolithic entity by physical  organizational  and psychological controls  The physical bonds included the network of military garrisons  which were stationed in every province  and the network of stone built roads that linked the provinces with Rome  The organizational bonds were based on the common principles of law and administration and on the universal army of officials who enforced common standards of conduct  The psychological controls were built on fear and punishment on the absolute certainty that anyone or anything that threatened the authority of Rome would be utterly destroyed 
The source of Roman obsession with unity and cohesion may well have lain in the pattern of Rome s early development  Whereas Greece had grown from scores of scattered cities  Rome grew from one single organism  While the Greek world had expanded along the Mediterranean seas lanes  the Roman world was assembled by territorial conquest  Of course  the contrast is not quite so stark  in Alexander the Great the Greeks had found the greatest territorial conqueror of all time  and the Romans  once they moved outside Italy  did not fail to learn the lessons of sea power  Yet the essential difference is undeniable  The key to the Greek world lay in its high powered ships  the key to Roman power lay in its marching legions  The Greeks were wedded to the sea  the Romans  to the land  The Greek was a sailor at heart  the Roman  a landsman 

Certainly  in trying to explain the Roman phenomenon  one would have to place great emphasis on this almost instinct for the territorial imperative  Roman priorities lay in the organization  exploitation  and defense of their territory  In all probability it was the fertile plain of Latium  where the Latins who founded Rome originated  that created the habits and skills of landed settlement  landed property  landed economy  landed administration  and a land based society  From this arose the Roman genius for military organization and orderly government  In turn  a deep attachment to the land  and to the stability which rural life engenders  fostered the Roman virtues  gravitas  a sense of responsibility  pietas  and a sense of devotion to family and country  and iustitia  a sense of the natural order 

Modern attitudes to Roman civilization range from the infinitely impressed to the thoroughly disgusted  As always  there are the power worshippers  especially among historians  who are predisposed to admire whatever is strong  who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece  At the same time  there is a solid body of opinion that dislikes Rome  For many  Rome is at best the imitator and the continuator of Greece on a larger scale  Greek civilization had quality  Rome  mere quantity  Greece was original  Rome  derivative  Greece had style  Rome had money  Greece was the inventor  Rome  the research and development division  Such indeed was the opinion of some of the more intellectual Romans   Had the Greeks held novelty in such disdain as we   asked Horace in his epistle   what work of ancient date would now exist  

Rome s debt to Greece was enormous  The Romans adopted Greek religion and moral philosophy  In literature  Greek writers were consciously used as models by their Latin successors  It was absolutely accepted that an educated Roman should be fluent in Greek  In speculative philosophy and the sciences  the Romans made virtually no advance on early achievements 

Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was somehow a junior partner in Greco Roman civilization  The Roman genius was projected into new spheres especially into those of law  military organization  administration  and engineering  Moreover  the tensions that arose within the Roman state produced literary and artistic sensibilities of the highest order  It was no accident that many leading Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of high caliber

Agriculture  Iron  and the Bantu Peoples
There is evidence of agriculture in Africa prior to 3000 B C  It may have developed independently  but many scholars believe that the spread of agriculture and iron throughout Africa linked it to the major centers of the Near East and Mediterranean world  The drying up of what is now the Sahara desert had pushed many peoples to the south into sub Sahara Africa  These peoples settled at first in scattered hunting and gathering bands  although in some places near lakes and rivers  people who fished  with a more secure food supply  lived in larger population concentrations  Agriculture seems to have reached these people from the Near East  since the first domesticated crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are not African but west Asian  Once the idea of planting diffused  Africans began to develop their own crops  such as certain varieties of rice  and they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to new imports  The proposed areas of the domestication of African crops lie in a band that extends from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to West Africa  Subsequently  other crops  such as bananas  were introduced from Southeast Asia 
Livestock also came from outside Africa  Cattle were introduced from Asia  as probably were domestic sheep and goats  Horses were apparently introduced by the Hyksos invaders of Egypt  1780 1560 B C   and then spread across the Sudan to West Africa  Rock paintings in the Sahara indicate that horses and chariots were used to traverse the desert and that by 300 200 B C   there were trade routes across the Sahara  Horses were adopted by peoples of the West African savannah  and later their powerful cavalry forces allowed them to carve out large empires  Finally  the camel was introduced around the first century A D  This was an important innovation  because the camel s abilities to thrive in harsh desert conditions and to carry large loads cheaply made it an effective and efficient means of transportation  The camel transformed the desert from a barrier into a still difficult  but more accessible  route of trade and communication 
Iron came from West Asia  although its routes of diffusion were somewhat different than those of agriculture  Most of Africa presents a curious case in which societies moved directly from a technology of stone to iron without passing through the intermediate stage of copper or bronze metallurgy  although some early copper working sites have been found in West Africa  Knowledge of iron making penetrated into the forest and savannahs of West Africa at roughly the same time that iron making was reaching Europe  Evidence of iron making has been found in Nigeria  Ghana  and Mali 
This technological shift cause profound changes in the complexity of African societies  Iron represented power  In West Africa the blacksmith who made tools and weapons had an important place in society  often with special religious powers and functions  Iron hoes  which made the land more productive  and iron weapons  which made the warrior more powerful  had symbolic meaning in a number of West Africa societies  Those who knew the secrets of making iron gained ritual and sometimes political power 
Unlike in the Americas  where metallurgy was a very late and limited development  Africans had iron from a relatively early date  developing ingenious furnaces to produce the high heat needed for production and to control the amount of air that reached the carbon and iron ore necessary for making iron  Much of Africa moved right into the Iron Age  taking the basic technology and adapting it to local conditions and resources 
The diffusion of agriculture and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations  These people probably originated in eastern Nigeria  Their migration may have been set in motion by an increase in population caused by a movement of peoples fleeing the desiccation  or drying up  of the Sahara  They spoke a language  proto Bantu   Bantu  means  the people    which is the parent tongue of a language of a large number of Bantu languages still spoken throughout sub Sahara Africa  Why and how these people spread out into central and southern Africa remains a mystery  but archaeologists believe that their iron weapons allowed them to conquer their hunting gathering opponents  who still used stone implements  Still  the process is uncertain  and peaceful migration or simply rapid demographic growth may have also caused the Bantu explosion  




1  The word  diffused  in the passage is closest in meaning to

2  According to paragraph 1  why do researchers doubt that agriculture developed independently in Africa 
 African lakes and rivers already provided enough food for people to survive without agriculture 
 The earliest examples of cultivated plants discovered in Africa are native to Asia 
 Africa s native plants are very difficult to domesticate 
 African communities were not large enough to support agriculture 
3  In paragraph 1  what does the author imply about changes in the African environment during this time period 
 The climate was becoming milder  allowing for a greater variety of crops to be grown 
 Although periods of drying forced people south  they returned once their food supply was secure 
 Population growth along rivers and lakes was dramatically decreasing the availability of fish 
 A region that had once supported many people was becoming a desert where few could survive 
4  According to paragraph 2  camels were important because they 
 were the first domesticated animal to be introduced to Africa
 allowed the people of the West African savannahs to carve out large empires
 helped African peoples defend themselves against Egyptian invaders
 made it cheaper and easier to cross the Sahara

5  According to paragraph 2  which of the following were subjects of rock paintings in the Sahara

10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 While American iron makers developed the latest furnaces  African iron makers continued using earlier techniques 
 Africans produced iron much earlier than Americans  inventing technologically sophisticated heating systems 
 Iron making developed earlier in Africa than in the Americas because of the ready availability of carbon and iron ore

Agriculture and iron working probably spread to Africa from neighboring regions 
 
 
 

Answer choices

 Once Africans developed their own crops  they no longer borrowed from other regions 
 The harshness of the African climate meant that agriculture could not develop until after the introduction of iron tools 
 The use of livestock improved transportation and trade and allowed for new forms of political control 
 As the Sahara expanded  the camel gained in importance  eventually coming to have religious significance 
 The spread of iron working had far reaching effects on social  economic  and political organization in Africa 
 Today s Bantu speaking peoples are descended from a technologically advanced people who spread throughout Africa

The Rise of Teotihuacán
The city of Teotihuacán  which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of modern day Mexico City  began its growth by 200 100 B C  At its height  between about A D  150 and 700  it probably had a population of more than 125 000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers  It had over 2 000 apartment complexes  a great market  a large number of industrial workshops  an administrative center  a number of massive religious edifices  and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings  Clearly  much planning and central control were involved in the expansion and ordering of this great metropolis   Moreover  the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica  modern Central America and Mexico    
How did this tremendous development take place  and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley  Among the main factors are Teotihuacán s geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico  the obsidian resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself  and the valley s potential for extensive irrigation  The exact role of other factors is much more difficult to pinpoint―for instance  Teotihuacán s religious significance as a shrine  the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first millennium B C   the ingenuity and foresightedness of Teotihuacán s elite  and  finally  the impact of natural disasters  such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B C 
This last factor is at least circumstantially implicated in Teotihuacán s rise  Prior to 200 B C   a number of relatively small centers coexisted in and near the Valley of Mexico  Around this time  the largest of these centers  Cuicuilco  was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption  with much of its agricultural land covered by lava  With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival  any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico  The archaeological evidence clearly indicates  though  that Teotihuacán was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A D 
It seems likely that Teotihuacán s natural resources  along with the city elite s ability to recognize their potential  gave the city a competitive edge over its neighbors  The valley  like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands  was rich in obsidian  The hard volcanic stone was a resource that had been in great demand for many years  at least since the rise of the Olmecs  a people who flourished between 1200 and 400 B C    and it apparently had a secure market  Moreover  recent research on obsidian tools found at Olmec sites has shown that some of the obsidian obtained by the Olmecs originated near Teotihuacán  Teotihuacán obsidian must have been recognized as a valuable commodity for many centuries before the great city arose 
Long distance trade in obsidian probably gave the elite residents of Teotihuacán access to a wide variety of exotic good  as well as a relatively prosperous life  Such success may have attracted immigrants to Teotihuacán  In addition  Teotihuacán s elite may have consciously attempted to attract new inhabitants  It is also probable that as early as 200 B C  Teotihuacán may have achieved some religious significance and its shrine  or shrines  may have served as an additional population magnet  Finally  the growing population was probably fed by increasing the number and size of irrigated fields 
The picture of Teotihuacán that emerges is a classic picture of positive feedback among obsidian mining and working  trade  population growth  irrigation  and religious tourism  The thriving obsidian operation  for example  would necessitate more miners  additional manufacturers of obsidian tools  and additional traders to carry the goods to new markets  All this led to increased wealth  which in turn would attract more immigrants to Teotihuacán  The growing power of the elite  who controlled the economy  would give them the means to physically coerce people to move to Teotihuacán and serve as additions to the labor force  More irrigation works would have to be built to feed the growing population  and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite

 Teotihuacán s location on a natural trade route


6  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B C  
 They were more frequent than historians once thought 
 They may have done more damage to Teotihuacán than to neighboring centers 
 They may have played a major role in the rise of Teotihuacán 
 They increased the need for extensive irrigation in the Teotihuacán Valley 

7  What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about Cuicuilco prior to 200 B C  
 It was a fairly small city until that date 
 It was located outside the Valley of Mexico 
 It emerged rapidly as an economical and political center 
 Its economy relied heavily on agriculture 

8  The word  predominant  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 most aggressive
 most productive
 principal
 earliest











9  Which of the following allowed Teotihuacán to have  a competitive edge over its neighbors  
 A well exploited and readily available commodity
 The presence of a highly stable elite class
 Knowledge derived directly from the Olmecs about the art of toolmaking
 Scarce natural resources in nearby areas such as those located in what are now the Guatemalan and Mexican highlands
10  According to paragraph 4  what has recent research on obsidian tools found at Olmec sites shown 
 Obsidian s value was understood only when Teotihuacán became an important city 
 The residents of Teotihuacán were sophisticated toolmakers 
 The residents of Teotihuacán traded obsidian with the Olmecs as early as 400 B C 
 Some of the obsidian used by the Olmecs came from the area around Teotihuacán

 give an example of an industry that took very little time to develop in Teotihuacán
 Illustrate how several factors influenced each other to make Teotihuacán a powerful and wealthy city
 explain how a successful industry can be a source of wealth and a source of conflict at the same time

Teotihuacán was a highly developed city in Mesoamerica that reached its peak between about A D  150 and 700 
 
 
 








Answer choices

 The number and sophistication of the architectural  administrative  commercial  and religious features of Teotihuacan indicate the existence of centralized planning and control 
 Teotihuacán may have developed its own specific local religion as a result of the cultural advances made possible by the city s great prosperity 
 As a result of its large number of religious shrines  by the first century A D   Teotihuacan become the most influential religious center in all of Mesoamerica 
 Several factors may account for Teotihuacán s extraordinary development  including its location  rich natural resources  irrigation potential  intelligent elite  and the misfortune of rival communities 
 In many important areas  from the obsidian industry to religious tourism  Teotihuacán s success and prosperity typified the classic positive feedback cycle 
 Although many immigrants settled in Teotihuacán between A D 150 and 700  the increasing threat of coerced labor discouraged further settlement and limited Teotihuacán s population growth 



Extinction of the Dinosaurs


Paleozoic Era 334 to 248 million years ago
Mesozoic Era 245 to 65 million years ago
 Triassic Period
 Jurassic Period
 Cretaceous Period
Cenozoic Era 65 million years ago to the present


Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic alterations associated with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from plate tectonics  Off and on throughout the Cretaceous  the last period of the Mesozoic era  during which dinosaurs flourished   large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents  Data from diverse sources  including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments  indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than today s  The days were not too hot  nor the nights too cold  The summers were not too warm  nor the winters too frigid  The shallow seas on the continents probably buffered the temperature of the nearby air  keeping it relatively constant 


At the end of the Cretaceous  the geological record shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the major ocean basins  No one knows why  Over a period of about 100 000 years  while the seas pulled back  climates around the world became dramatically more extreme  warmer days  cooler nights  hotter summers  colder winters  Perhaps dinosaurs could not tolerate these extreme temperature changes and became extinct 


If true  though  why did cold blooded animals such as snakes  lizards  turtles  and crocodiles survive the freezing winters and torrid summers  These animals are at the mercy of the climate to maintain a livable body temperature  It s hard to understand why they would not be affected  whereas dinosaurs were left too crippled to cope  especially if  as some scientists believe  dinosaurs were warm blooded  Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had retreated from and advanced on the continents numerous times during the Mesozoic  so why did the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with the earlier fluctuations but not with this one  Although initially appealing  the hypothesis of a simple climatic change related to sea levels is insufficient to explain all the data 


Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions led to a surprising observation that  in turn  has suggested a new hypothesis  Many plants and animals disappear abruptly from the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic  the era after the Mesozoic   Between the last layer of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic rock  there is often a thin layer of clay  Scientists felt that they could get an idea of how long the extinctions took by determining how long it took to deposit this one centimeter of clay and they thought they could determine the time it took to deposit the clay by determining the amount of the element iridium  Ir  it contained 


Ir has not been common at Earth s since the very beginning of the planet s history  Because it usually exists in a metallic state  it was preferentially incorporated in Earth s core as the planet cooled and consolidated  Ir is found in high concentrations in some meteorites  in which the solar system s original chemical composition is preserved  Even today  microscopic meteorites continually bombard Earth  falling on both land and sea  By measuring how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a given period of time  scientists can estimate how long it might have taken to deposit the observed amount of Ir in the boundary clay  These calculations suggest that a period of about one million years would have been required  However  other reliable evidence suggests that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years  So the unusually high concentration of Ir seems to require a special explanation 


In view of these facts  scientists hypothesized that a single large asteroid  about 10 to 15 kilometers across  collided with Earth  and the resulting fallout created the boundary clay  Their calculations show that the impact kicked up a dust cloud that cut off sunlight for several months  inhibiting photosynthesis in plants  decreased surface temperatures on continents to below freezing  caused extreme episodes of acid rain  and significantly raised long term global temperatures through the greenhouse effect  This disruption of food chain and climate would have eradicated the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years 

 






1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is true of the Late Cretaceous climate 
 Summers were very warm and winters were very cold 
 Shallow seas on the continents caused frequent temperature changes 
 The climate was very similar to today s climate 
 The climate did not change dramatically from season to season 









2  Which of the following reasons is suggested in paragraph 2 for the extinction of the dinosaurs 
 Changes in the lengths of the days and nights during the late Cretaceous period
 Droughts caused by the movement of seaways back into the oceans
 The change from mild to severe climates during the Late Cretaceous period
 An extreme decrease in the average yearly temperature over 10 ooo years











3  Why does the author mention the survival of  snakes  lizards  turtles  and crocodiles  in paragraph 3 
 To argue that dinosaurs may have become extinct because they were not cold blooded animals
 To question the adequacy of the hypothesis that climatic change related to sea levels caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
 To present examples of animals that could maintain a livable body temperature more easily than dinosaurs
 To support a hypothesis that these animals were not as sensitive to climate changes in the Cretaceous period as they are today

 adapt
 move
 continue
 compete

5  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is true of changes in climate before the Cretaceous period and the effect of these changes on dinosaurs 
 Climate changes associated with the movement of seaways before the Cretaceous period did not cause dinosaurs to become extinct 
 Changes in climate before the Cretaceous period caused severe fluctuations in sea level  resulting in the extinction of the dinosaurs 
 Frequent changes in climate before the Cretaceous period made dinosaurs better able to maintain a livable body temperature 
 Before the Cretaceous period there were few changes in climate  and dinosaurs flourished

 extremes
 retreats
 periods

10  Paragraph 5 implies that a special explanation of Ir in the boundary clay is needed because 
 the Ir in microscopic meteorites reaching Earth during the Cretaceous period would have been incorporated into Earth s core
 the Ir in the boundary clay was deposited much more than a million years ago
 the concentration of Ir in the boundary clay is higher than in microscopic meteorites
 the amount of Ir in the boundary clay is too great to have come from microscopic meteorites during the time the boundary clay was deposited

For a long time scientists have argued that the extinction of the dinosaurs was related to climate change 
 
 
 






Answer choices

 A simple climate change does not explain some important data related to the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous 
 The retreat of the seaways at the end of the Cretaceous has not been fully explained 
 The abruptness of extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous and the high concentration of Ir found in clay deposited at that time have fueled the development of a new hypothesis 
 Extreme changes in daily and seasonal climates preceded the retreat of the seas back into the major ocean basins 
 Some scientists hypothesize that the extinction of the dinosaurs resulted from the effects of an asteroid collision with Earth 
 Boundary clay layers like the one between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic are used by scientists to determine the rate at which an extinct species declined 




Running Water on Mars

Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water once existed in great quantity on the surface of Mars  Two types of flow features are seen  runoff channels and outflow channels  Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands  These flow features are extensive systems sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length of interconnecting  twisting channels that seem to merge into larger  wider channels  They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth  and geologists think that they are dried up beds of long gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys  Runoff channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago  the age of the Martian highlands   when the atmosphere was thicker  the surface warmer  and liquid water widespread 

Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago  They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks  Instead  they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains  The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop shaped  islands  resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide  that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels  Judging from the width and depth of the channels  the flow rates must have been truly enormous perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon River  Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago  about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed 

Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers  lakes  and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface  A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta a fan shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water  in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands  Other researchers go even further  suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface  A computer generated view of the Martian North Polar Region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands  The Hellas Basin  which measures some 3 000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin s rim  is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea 

These ideas remain controversial  Proponents point to features such as the terraced  beaches  shown in one image  which could conceivably have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded  But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity  perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south  in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water  Furthermore  Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean  Their absence supports the picture of a cold  dry Mars that never experienced the extended mild period required to form lakes and oceans  However  more recent data imply that at least some parts of the planet did in fact experience long periods in the past during which liquid water existed on the surface 

Aside from some small scale gullies  channels  found since 2000  which are inconclusive  astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today  and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny  Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans  the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past  Where did all the water go  The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface  with more contained in the planet s polar caps

There is much debate concerning whether Mars once had water 
 
 
 


Answer choices

 Mars  runoff and outflow channels are large scale  distinctive features that suggest that large quantities of liquid water once flowed on Mars 
 Although some researchers claim that Mars may once have had oceans  others dispute this  pointing to an absence of evidence or offering alternative interpretations of evidence    
 Various types of images have been used to demonstrate that most of Martian surface contains evidence of flowing water 
 The runoff and outflow channels of Mars apparently carried a higher volume of water and formed more extensive networks than do Earth s river systems 
 There is very little evidence of liquid water on Mars today  and it is assumed that all the water that once existed on the planet is frozen beneath its surface 
 While numerous gullies have been discovered on Mars since 2000  many astronomers dismiss them as evidence that Mars once had liquid water

Colonizing the Americas via the Northwest Coast


It has long been accepted that the Americas were colonized by a migration of peoples from Asia  slowly traveling across a land bridge called Beringia  now the Bering Strait between northeastern Asia and Alaska  during the last Ice Age  The first water craft theory about this migration was that around 11 000 12 000 years ago there was an ice free corridor stretching from eastern Beringia to the areas of North America south of the great northern glaciers  It was this midcontinental corridor between two massive ice sheets–the Laurentide to the east and the Cordilleran to the west–that enabled the southward migration  But belief in this ice free corridor began to crumble when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald demonstrated that some of the most important radiocarbon dates used to support the existence of an ice free corridor were incorrect  He persuasively argued that such an ice free corridor did not exist until much later  when the continental ice began its final retreat  

Support is growing for the alternative theory that people using watercraft  possibly skin boats  moved southward from Beringia along the Gulf of Alaska and then southward along the Northwest coast of North America possibly as early as 16 000 years ago  This route would have enabled humans to enter southern areas of the Americas prior to the melting of the continental glaciers  Until the early 1970s  most archaeologists did not consider the coast a possible migration route into the Americas because geologists originally believed that during the last Ice Age the entire Northwest Coast was covered by glacial ice  It had been assumed that the ice extended westward from the Alaskan Canadian Mountains to the very edge of the continental shelf  the flat  submerged part of the continent that extends into the ocean  This would have created a barrier of ice extending from the Alaska Peninsula  through the Gulf of Alaska and southward along the Northwest Coast of North America to what is today the state of Washington  

The most influential proponent of the coastal migration route has been Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark  He theorized that with the use of watercraft  people gradually colonized unglaciated refuges and areas along the continental shelf exposed by the lower sea level  Fladmark s hypothesis received additional support form from the fact that the greatest diversity in Native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americas  suggesting that this region has been settled the longest  

More recent geologic studies documented deglaciation and the existence of ice free areas throughout major coastal areas of British Columbia  Canada  by 13 000 years ago  Research now indicates that sizable areas of   southeastern Alaska along the inner continental shelf were not covered by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age  One study suggests that except for a 250 mile coastal area between southwestern British Columbia and Washington State  the Northwest Coast of North America was largely free of ice by approximately 16 000 years ago  Vast areas along the coast may have been deglaciated beginning around 16 000 years ago  possibly providing a coastal corridor for the movement of plants  animals  and humans sometime between 13 000 and 14 000 years ago  


The coastal hypothesis has gained increasing support in recent years because the remains of large land animals  such as caribou and brown bears  have been found in southeastern Alaska dating between 10 000 and 12 500 years ago  This is the time period in which most scientists formerly believed the area to be inhospitable for humans  It has been suggested that if the environment were capable of supporting breeding populations of bears  there would have been enough food resources to support humans  Fladmark and other believe that the first human colonization of America occurred by boat along the Northwest Coast during the very late Ice Age  possibly as early as 14 000 years ago  The most recent geologic evidence indicates that it may have been possible for people to colonize ice free regions along the continental shelf that were still exposed by the lower sea level between13 000 and 14 000 years ago 

The coastal hypothesis suggests an economy based on marine mammal hunting  saltwater fishing  shellfish gathering  and the use of watercraft  Because of the barrier of ice to the east  the Pacific Ocean to the west  and populated areas to the north  there may have been a greater impetus for people to move in a southerly direction 
 







1  According to paragraph 1  the theory that people first migrated to the Americans by way of an ice free corridor was seriously called into question by 
 paleoecologist Glen MacDonald s argument that the original migration occurred much later than had previously been believed
 the demonstration that certain previously accepted radiocarbon dates were incorrect
 evidence that the continental ice began its final retreat much later than had previously been believed
 research showing that the ice free corridor was not as long lasting as had been widely assumed

5  Paragraph 2 supports the idea that  before the 1970s  most archaeologists held which of the following views about the earliest people to reach the Americas 
 They could not have sailed directly from Beringia to Alaska and then southward because  it was thought  glacial ice covered the entire coastal region 
 They were not aware that the climate would continue to become milder 
 They would have had no interest in migrating southward from Beringia until after the continental glaciers had begun to melt 
 They lacked the navigational skills and appropriate boats needed long distance trips 

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways to leave out essential information  
 Because this region has been settled the longest  it also displays the greatest diversity in Native American languages 
 Fladmark s hypothesis states that the west coast of the Americas has been settled longer than any other region 
 The fact that the greatest diversity of Native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americans lends strength to Fradmark s hypothesis 
 According to Fladmark  Native American languages have survived the longest along the west coast of the Americas  






7  The author s purpose in paragraph 4 is to 
 indicate that a number of recent geologic studies seem to provide support for the coastal hypothesis
 indicate that coastal and inland migrations may have happened simultaneously
 explain why humans may have reached America s northwest coast before animals and plants did
 show that the coastal hypothesis may explain how people first reached Alaska but it cannot explain how people reached areas like modern British Columbia and Washington State

9  According to paragraph 5  the discovery of the remains of large land animals supports the coastal hypothesis by providing evidence that 
 humans were changing their hunting techniques to adapt to coastal rather than inland environments
 animals had migrated from the inland to the coasts  an indication that a midcontinental ice free corridor was actually implausible
 humans probably would have been able to find enough resources along the coastal corridor
 the continental shelf was still exposed by lower sea levels during the period when the southward migration of people began

Recent evidence favors a rival to the long standing theory that the Americas were colonized 11 000 12 000 years ago by people migrating south from Beringia along a midcontinental ice free corridor 
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Evidence that an ice free corridor between two ice sheets developed when the continental ice first began to melt came primarily from radiocarbon dating 
 There is growing support for the theory that migration took place much earlier  by sea  following a coastal route along Alaska and down the northwest coast 
 Recent geologic evidence indicates that contrary to what had been believed  substantial areas along the coast were free of ice as early as 16 000 years ago 
 Research now indicates that the parts of the inner continental shelf that remained covered with ice were colonized by a variety of early human groups well adapted to living in extremely cold environments 
 There is evidence suggesting that areas along the coast may have contained enough food resources between 13 000 and 14 000 years ago to have made human colonization possible 
 Even though the northern part of the continent allowed for a more varied economy  several early human groups quickly moved south 






 
Reflection in Teaching

Teachers  it is thought  benefit from the practice of reflection  the conscious act of thinking deeply about and carefully examining the interactions and events within their own classrooms  Educators T  Wildman and J  Niles  1987  describe a scheme for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers  This was justified by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity of scientific fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the discipline of teaching  
Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which reflection might flourish–a subject on which there is little guidance in the literature  They designed an experimental strategy for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years  They were concerned that many would be  drawn to these new  refreshing  conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher reflection is too great to bridge  Reflection on a complex task such as teaching is not easy   The teachers were taken through a program of talking about teaching events  moving on to reflecting about specific issues in a supported  and later an independent  manner  
Wildman and Niles observed that systematic reflection on teaching required a sound ability to understand classroom events in an objective manner  They describe the initial understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being  utilitarian …and not rich or detailed enough to drive systematic reflection   Teachers rarely have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an objective manner  Further observation revealed the tendency of teachers to evaluate events rather than review the contributory factors in a considered manner by  in effect  standing outside the situation  
Helping this group of teachers to revise their thinking about classroom events became central  This process took time and patience and effective trainers  The researchers estimate that the initial training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours  with the same number of hours again being required to practice the skills of reflection  
Wildman and Niles identify three principles that facilitate reflective practice in a teaching situation  The first is support from administrators in an education system  enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students  The second is the availability of sufficient time and space  The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the immediate demands of others in order to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills  The third is the development of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers  Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their professional life with which they were not comfortable  Wildman and Niles make a summary comment   Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher as reflective practitioner will not happen simply because it is a good or even compelling idea  
The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice  Others have noted this  making a similar point about the teaching profession s cultural inhibitions about reflective practice  Zeichner and Liston  1987  point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a  reflective  professional decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician  putting into practice the ideas of theirs  More basic than the cultural issues is the matter of motivation  Becoming a reflective practitioner requires extra work  Jaworski  1993  and has only vaguely defined goals with  perhaps  little initially perceivable reward and the threat of vulnerability  Few have directly questioned what might lead a teacher to want to become reflective  Apparently  the most obvious reason for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing  There appear to be many unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect –for example  the value of externally motivated reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might reflect by habit

4  All of the following are mentioned about the experimental strategy described in paragraph 2 EXCEPT 
 It was designed so that teachers would eventually reflect without help from others 
 It was used by a group of teachers over a period of years 
 It involved having teachers take part in discussions of classroom events 
 It involved having teachers record in writing their reflections about teaching 

5  According to paragraph 2  Wildman and Niles worried that the teachers they were working with might feel that 
 the number of teachers involved in their program was too large
 the concepts of teacher reflection were so abstract that they could not be applied
 the ideas involved in reflection were actually not new and refreshing
 several years would be needed to acquire the habit of reflecting on their teaching

7  According to paragraph 3  what did the teachers working with Wildman and Niles often fail to do when they attempted to practice reflection 
 Correctly calculate the amount of time needed for reflection 
 Provide sufficiently detailed descriptions of the methods they used to help them reflect 
 Examine thoughtfully the possible causes of events in their classrooms 
 Establish realistic goals for themselves in practicing reflection 

8  How is paragraph 4 related to other aspects of the discussion of reflection in the passage 
 It describes and comments on steps taken to overcome problems identified earlier in the passage 
 It challenges the earlier claim that teachers rarely have the time to think about their own or others  teaching 
 It identifies advantages gained by teachers who followed the training program described earlier in the passage 
 It explains the process used to define the principles discussed later in the passage 


9  The word  compelling  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 commonly held
 persuasive
 original
 practical

10  According to paragraph 6  teachers may be discouraged from reflecting because
 it is not generally supported by teacher educators
 the benefits of reflection may not be apparent immediately
 it is impossible to teach and reflect on one s teaching at the same time
 they have often failed in their attempts to become reflective practitioners

11  Which of the sentences below expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The practice of being reflective is no longer simply a habit among teachers but something that is externally motivated 
 Most teachers need to explore ways to form the habit of reflection even when no external motivation exists 
 Many aspects of the motivation to reflect have not been studied  including the comparative benefits of externally motivated and habitual reflection among teachers 
 There has not been enough exploration of why teachers practice reflection as a habit with or without external motivation

Wildman and Niles have conducted research on reflection in teaching
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Through their work with Virginia teachers  Wildman and Niles proved conclusively that reflection  though difficult  benefits both teachers and students 
 Wildman and Niles found that considerable training and practice are required to understand classroom events and develop the skills involved in reflection 
 Wildman and Niles identified three principles that teachers can use to help themselves cope with problems that may arise as a result of reflection  
 Wildman and Niles concluded that teachers need sufficient resources as well as the cooperation and encouragement of others to practice reflection 
 There are numerous obstacles to implementing reflection in schools and insufficient understanding of why teachers might want to reflect 
 Whether teachers can overcome the difficulties involved in reflection may depend on the nature and intensity of their motivation to reflect 













 
The Arrival of Plant Life in Hawaii

When the Hawaiian Islands emerged from the sea as volcanoes  starting about five million years ago  they were far removed from other landmasses  Then  as blazing sunshine alternated with drenching rains  the harsh  barren surfaces of the black rocks slowly began to soften  Winds brought a variety of life forms  

Spores light enough to float on the breezes were carried thousands of miles from more ancient lands and deposited at random across the bare mountain flanks  A few of these spores found a toehold on the dark  forbidding rocks and grew and began to work their transformation upon the land  Lichens were probably the first successful flora  These are not single individual plants  each one is a symbiotic combination of an alga and a fungus  The algae capture the sun s energy by photosynthesis and store it in organic molecules  The fungi absorb moisture and mineral salts from the rocks  passing these on in waste products that nourish algae  It is significant that the earliest living things that built communities on these islands are examples of symbiosis  a phenomenon that depends upon the close cooperation of two or more forms of life and a principle that is very important in island communities  

Lichens helped to speed the decomposition of the hard rock surfaces  preparing a soft bed of soil that was abundantly supplied with minerals that had been carried in the molten rock from the bowels of Earth  Now  other forms of life could take hold  ferns and mosses  two of the most ancient types of land plants  that flourish even in rock crevices  These plants propagate by producing spores–tiny fertilized cells that contain all the instructions for making a new plant–but the spore are unprotected by any outer coating and carry no supply of nutrient  Vast numbers of them fall on the ground beneath the mother plants  Sometimes they are carried farther afield by water or by wind  But only those few spores that settle down in very favorable locations can start new life  the vast majority fall on barren ground  By force of sheer numbers  however  the mosses and ferns reached Hawaii  survived  and multiplied  Some species developed great size  becoming tree ferns that even now grow in the Hawaiian forests  

Many millions of years after ferns evolved  but long before the Hawaiian Islands were born from the sea   another kind of flora evolved on Earth  the seed bearing plants  This was a wonderful biological invention  The seed has an outer coating that surrounds the genetic material of the new plant  and inside this covering is a concentrated supply of nutrients  Thus the seed s chances of survival are greatly enhanced over those of the naked spore  One type of seed bearing plant  the angiosperm  includes all forms of blooming vegetation  In the angiosperm the seeds are wrapped in an additional layer of covering  Some of these coats are hard–like the shell of a nut–for extra protection  Some are soft and tempting  like a peach or a cherry  In some angiosperms the seeds are equipped with gossamer wings  like the dandelion and milkweed seeds  These new characteristics offered better ways for the seed to move to new habitats  They could travel through the air  float in water  and lie dormant for many months  

Plants with large  buoyant seeds like coconuts drift on ocean currents and are washed up on the shores  Remarkably resistant to the vicissitudes of ocean travel  they can survive prolonged immersion in saltwater when they come to rest on warm beaches and the conditions are favorable  the seed coats soften  Nourished by their imported supply of nutrients  the young plants push out their roots and establish their place in the sun  

By means of these seeds  plants spread more widely to new locations  even to isolated islands like the Hawaiian archipelago  which lies more than 2 000 miles west of California and 3 500 miles east of Japan  The seeds of grasses  flowers  and blooming trees made the long trips to these islands   Grasses are simple forms of angiosperms that bear their encapsulated seeds on long stalks   In a surprisingly short time  angiosperms filled many of the land areas on Hawaii that had been bare

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the fungi in lichens benefit from their symbiotic relationship with algae in what way 
 The algae help the fungi meet some of their energy needs  
 The algae protect the fungi from the Sun s radiation 
 The algae provide the fungi with greater space for absorbing water 
 The fungi produce less waste in the presence of algae 

3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 Some of the earliest important examples of symbiosis the close cooperation of two or more living things occur in island communities  
 Symbiosis the close cooperation of pairs or small groups of living organisms is especially important in these island environments 
 The first organisms on these islands worked together closely in a relationship known as symbiosis  which is particularly important on islands 
 It is significant to note that organisms in the beginning stages of the development of island life cannot survive without close cooperation

6  According to paragraph 3  what was the relationship between lichens and ferns in the development of plant life on Hawaii 
 Ferns were able to grow because lichens created suitable soil 
 The decomposition of ferns produced minerals that were used by lichens 
 Lichens and ferns competed to grow in the same rocky environments 
 Lichens and ferns were typically found together in volcanic areas 















7  The word  This  in the passage refers to 
 the spread of ferns and mosses in Hawaii
 the creation of the Hawaiian Islands
 the evolution of ferns
 the development of plants that produce seeds
  8  According to paragraph 4  why do seeds have a greater chance of survival than spores do  To receive credit  you must select TWO answer choices 
 Seeds need less water to grow into a mature plant than spores do 
 Seeds do not need to rely on outside sources of nutrients 
 Seeds are better protected from environmental dangers than spores are 
 Seeds are heavier than spores and are therefore more likely to take root and grow 
9  Why does the author mention  a nut    a peach   and  a cherry  
 To indicate that some seeds are less likely to survive than others
 To point out that many angiosperms can be eaten
 To provide examples of blooming plants
 To illustrate the variety of coverings among angiosperm seeds
 10  The word  dormant  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 hidden
 inactive
 underground
 preserved

11  According to paragraph 5  a major reason that coconuts can establish themselves in distant locations is that their seeds can 
 survive long exposure to heat on island beaches
 float and survive for long periods in ocean water
 use saltwater for maintenance and growth 
 maintain hard  protective coats even after growing roots
12  According to the passage  which of the following characteristics do spores and seeds have in common 
 They may be surrounded by several layers of covering 
 They are produced by flowering plants 
 They may be spread by wind 
 They are able to grow in barren soils

Answers Choices

 Algae are classified as symbiotic because they produce energy through the process of photosynthesis 
 The first successful plants on Hawaii were probably lichens  which consist of algae and fungi living in a symbiotic relationship 
 Lichens helped create favorable conditions for the growth of spore producing plants such as ferns and mosses 
 Seed bearing plants evolved much later than spore producing plants  but both types of plants had evolved well before the formation of the Hawaiian Islands 
 Unlike spores  seeds must move to new habitats in order to have a strong chance of survival and growth 
 Seed bearing plants arrived and spread quickly in Hawaii  thanks to characteristics that increased their seeds  ability to survive and to move to different areas

Buffalo  zebras  wildebeests  topi  and Thomson s gazelles live in huge groups that together make up some 90 percent of the total weight of mammals living on the Serengeti Plain of East Africa  They are all herbivores  plant eating animals   and they all appear to be living on the same diet of grasses  herbs  and small bushes  This appearance  however  is illusory  When biologist Richard Bell and his colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of four of the five species  they did not study buffalo   they found that each species was living on a different part of the vegetation  The different vegetational parts differ in their food qualities  lower down  there are succulent  nutritious leaves  higher up are the harder stems  There are also sparsely distributed  highly nutritious fruits  and Bell found that only the Thomson s gazelles eat much of these  The other three species differ in the proportion of lower leaves and higher stems that they eat  zebras eat the most stem matter  wildebeests eat the most leaves  and topi are intermediate 

How are we to understand their different feeding preferences  The answer lies in two associated differences among the species  in their digestive systems and body sizes  According to their digestive systems  these herbivores can be divided into two categories  the nonruminants  such as the zebra  which has a digestive system like a horse  and the ruminants  such as the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle  which are like the cow   Nonruminants cannot extract much energy from the hard parts of a plant  however  this is more than made up for by the fast speed at which food passes through their guts  Thus  when there is only a short supply of poor quality food  the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle enjoy an advantage  They are ruminants and have a special structure  the rumen  in their stomachs  which contains microorganisms that can break down the hard parts of plants  Food passes only slowly through the ruminant s gut because ruminating digesting the hard parts takes time  The ruminant continually regurgitates food from its stomach back to its mouth to chew it up further  that is what a cow is doing when  chewing cud    Only when it has been chewed up and digested almost to a liquid can the food pass through the rumen and on through the gut  Larger particles cannot pass through until they have been chewed down to size  Therefore  when food is in short supply  a ruminant can last longer than a nonruminant because it can derive more energy out of the same food  The difference can partially explain the eating habits of the Serengeti herbivores  The zebra chooses areas where there is more low quality food  It migrates first to unexploited areas and chomps the abundant low quality stems before moving on  It is a fast in fast out feeder  relying on a high output of incompletely digested food  By the time the wildebeests  and other ruminants  arrive  the grazing and trampling of the zebras will have worn the vegetation down  As the ruminants then set to work  they eat down to the lower  leafier parts of the vegetation  All of this fits in with the differences in stomach contents with which we began 

The other part of the explanation is body size  Larger animals require more food than smaller animals  but smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate  Smaller animals can therefore live where there is less food  provided that such food is of high energy content  That is why the smallest of the herbivores  Thomson s gazelle  lives on fruit that is very nutritious but too thin on the ground to support a larger animal  By contrast  the large zebra lives on the masses of low quality stem material 

The differences in feeding preferences lead  in turn  to differences in migratory habits  The wildebeests follow  in their migration  the pattern of local rainfall  The other species do likewise  But when a new area is fueled by rain  the mammals migrate toward it in a set order to exploit it  The larger  less fastidious feeders  the zebras  move in first  the choosier  smaller wildebeests come later  and the smallest species of all  Thomson s gazelle  arrives last  The later species all depend on the preparations of the earlier one  for the actions of the zebra alter the vegetation to suit the stomachs of the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle

 The different digestive systems of herbivores explain their feeding preferences 
 Migratory habits are influenced by feeding preferences 
 Patterns in the migratory habits of East African herbivores are hard to establish 



















 
Loie Fuller
The United States dancer Loie Fuller  1862–1928  found theatrical dance in the late nineteenth century artistically unfulfilling  She considered herself an artist rather than a mere entertainer  and she  in turn  attracted the notice of other artists 
Fuller devised a type of dance that focused on the shifting play of lights and colors on the voluminous skirts or draperies she wore  which she kept in constant motion principally through movements of her arms  sometimes extended with wands concealed under her costumes  She rejected the technical virtuosity of movement in ballet  the most prestigious form of theatrical dance at that time  perhaps because her formal dance training was minimal  Although her early theatrical career had included stints as an actress  she was not primarily interested in storytelling or expressing emotions through dance  the drama of her dancing emanated from her visual effects 

Although she discovered and introduced her art in the United States  she achieved her greatest glory in Paris  where she was engaged by the Folies Bergère in 1892 and soon became  La Loie   the darling of Parisian audiences  Many of her dances represented elements or natural objects Fire  the Lily  the Butterfly  and so on and thus accorded well with the fashionable Art Nouveau style  which emphasized nature imagery and fluid  sinuous lines  Her dancing also attracted the attention of French poets and painters of the period  for it appealed to their liking for mystery  their belief in art for art s sake  a nineteenth century idea that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have some moral or educational benefit  and their efforts to synthesize form and content 

Fuller had scientific leanings and constantly experimented with electrical lighting  which was then in its infancy   colored gels  slide projections  and other aspects of stage technology  She invented and patented special arrangements of mirrors and concocted chemical dyes for her draperies  Her interest in color and light paralleled the research of several artists of the period  notably the painter Seurat  famed for his Pointillist technique of creating a sense of shapes and light on canvas by applying extremely small dots of color rather than by painting lines  One of Fuller s major inventions was underlighting  in which she stood on a pane of frosted glass illuminated from underneath  This was particularly effective in her Fire Dance  1895   performed to the music of Richard Wagner s  Ride of the Valkyries   The dance caught the eye of artist Henri de Toulouse Lautrec  who depicted it in a lithograph 

As her technological expertise grew more sophisticated  so did the other aspects of her dances  Although she gave little thought to music in her earliest dances  she later used scores by Gluck  Beethoven  Schubert  Chopin  and Wagner  eventually graduating to Stravinsky  Fauré  Debussy  and Mussorgsky  composers who were then considered progressive  She began to address more ambitious themes in her dances such as The Sea  in which her dancers invisibly agitated a huge expanse of silk  played upon by colored lights  Always open to scientific and technological innovations  she befriended the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie upon their discovery of radium and created a Radium Dance  which simulated the phosphorescence of that element  She both appeared in films then in an early stage of development and made them herself  the hero of her fairy tale film Le Lys de la Vie  1919  was played by René Clair  later a leading French film director  

At the Paris Exposition in 1900  she had her own theater  where  in addition to her own dances  she presented pantomimes by the Japanese actress Sada Yocco  She assembled an all female company at this time and established a school around 1908  but neither survived her  Although she is remembered today chiefly for her innovations in stage lighting  her activities also touched Isadora Duncan and Ruth St  Denis  two other United States dancers who were experimenting with new types of dance  She sponsored Duncan s first appearance in Europe  Her theater at the Paris Exposition was visited by St  Denis  who found new ideas about stagecraft in Fuller s work and fresh sources for her art in Sada Yocco s plays  In 1924 St  Denis paid tribute to Fuller with the duet Valse àla Loie

Green Icebergs

Icebergs are massive blocks of ice  irregular in shape  they float with only about 12 percent of their mass above the sea surface  They are formed by glaciers large rivers of ice that begin inland in the snows of Greenland  Antarctica  and Alaska and move slowly toward the sea  The forward movement  the melting at the base of the glacier where it meets the ocean  and waves and tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off and float out to sea 

Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white  although they sometimes appear dark or opaque because they carry gravel and bits of rock  They may change color with changing light conditions and cloud cover  glowing pink or gold in the morning or evening light  but this color change is generally related to the low angle of the Sun above the horizon  However  travelers to Antarctica have repeatedly reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea and  more commonly  close to the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica 

One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion when blue ice is illuminated by a near horizon red Sun  but green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great variety of light conditions  Another suggestion is that the color might be related to ice with high levels of metallic compounds  including copper and iron  Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores vertical  cylindrical ice samples reaching down to great depths from the glacial ice shelves along the Antarctic continent  Analyses of these cores and samples provide a different solution to the problem 

The ice shelf cores  with a total length of 215 meters  705 feet   were long enough to penetrate through glacial ice which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubbles and to continue into the clear  bubble free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the glacial ice  The properties of this clear sea ice were very similar to the ice from the green iceberg  The scientists concluded that green icebergs form when a two layer block of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes  turns upside down   exposing the bubble free shelf ice that was formed from seawater 

A green iceberg that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two distinct layers  bubbly blue white ice and bubble free green ice separated by a one meter  long ice layer containing sediments  The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion  Where cracks were present  the color was light green because of light scattering  where no cracks were present  the color was dark green  No air bubbles were present in the green ice  suggesting that the ice was not formed from the compression of snow but instead from the freezing of seawater  Large concentrations of single celled organisms with green pigments  coloring substances  occur along the edges of the ice shelves in this region  and the seawater is rich in their decomposing organic material  The green iceberg did not contain large amounts of particles from these organisms  but the ice had accumulated dissolved organic matter from the seawater  It appears that unlike salt  dissolved organic substances are not excluded from the ice in the freezing process  Analysis shows that the dissolved organic material absorbs enough blue wavelengths from solar light to make the ice appear green 

Chemical evidence shows that platelets  minute flat portions  of ice form in the water and then accrete and stick to the bottom of the ice shelf to form a slush  partially melted snow   The slush is compacted by an unknown mechanism  and solid  bubble free ice is formed from water high in soluble organic substances  When an iceberg separates from the ice shelf and capsizes  the green ice is exposed 

The Amery Ice Shelf appears to be uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs  Once detached from the ice shelf  these bergs drift in the currents and wind systems surrounding Antarctica and can be found scattered among Antarctica s less colorful icebergs 

1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true of icebergs EXCEPT 
 They do not have a regular shape 
 They are formed where glaciers meet the ocean 
 Most of their mass is above the sea surface 
 Waves and tides cause them to break off glaciers 



2  According to paragraph 2  what causes icebergs to sometimes appear dark or opaque 
 A heavy cloud cover
 The presence of gravel or bits of rock
 The low angle of the Sun above the horizon
 The presence of large cracks in their surface



3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 One explanation notes that green icebergs stand out among other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions  but this is attributed to an optical illusion 
 One explanation for the color of green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion that occurs when the light from a near horizon red Sun shines on a blue iceberg 
 One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to a great variety of light conditions  but green icebergs stand out best among other icebergs when illuminated by a near horizon red Sun 
 One explanation attributes the color of green icebergs to an optical illusion under special light conditions  but green icebergs appear distinct from other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions 










4  The word  penetrate  in the passage is closest in meaning to

5  According to paragraph 4  how is glacial ice formed 
 By the compaction of snow
 By the freezing of seawater on the bottom of ice shelves
 By breaking away from the ice shelf
 By the capsizing of a two layer block of shelf ice


6  According to paragraph 4  ice shelf cores helped scientists explain the formation of green icebergs by showing that 
 the ice at the bottom of green icebergs is bubble free ice formed from frozen seawater
 bubble free ice is found at the top of the ice shelf
 glacial ice is lighter and floats better than sea ice
 the clear sea ice at the bottom of the ice shelf is similar to ice from a green iceberg
























7  Why does the author mention that  The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion  
 To explain why cracks in the iceberg appeared light green instead of dark green

Several suggestions  ranging from light conditions to the presence of metallic compounds  have been offered to explain why some icebergs appear green 
 
 
 







Answer Choices

 Ice cores were used to determine that green icebergs were formed from the compaction of metallic compounds  including copper and iron 
 All ice shelves can produce green icebergs  but the Amery Ice Shelf is especially well suited to do so  
 Green icebergs form when a two layer block of ice breaks away from a glacier and capsizes  exposing the bottom sea ice to view 
 Ice cores and samples revealed that both ice shelves and green icebergs contain a layer of bubbly glacial ice and a layer of bubble free sea ice 
 Green icebergs are white until they come into contact with seawater containing platelets and soluble organic green pigments  
 In a green iceberg  the sea ice contains large concentrations of organic matter from the seawater

Chinese Pottery
China has one of the world s oldest continuous civilizations despite invasions and occasional foreign rule  A country as vast as China with so long lasting a civilization has a complex social and visual history  within which pottery and porcelain play a major role 
The function and status of ceramics in China varied from dynasty to dynasty  so they may be utilitarian  burial  trade collectors   or even ritual objects  according to their quality and the era in which they were made  The ceramics fall into three broad types earthenware  stoneware  and porcelain for vessels  architectural items such as roof tiles  and modeled objects and figures  In addition  there was an important group of sculptures made for religious use  the majority of which were produced in earthenware 
The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware temperatures  but as early as the fifteenth century B C   high temperature stonewares were being made with glazed surfaces  During the Six Dynasties period  AD 265 589   kilns in north China were producing high fired ceramics of good quality  Whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan provinces from the seventh to the tenth centuries evolved into the highly prized porcelains of the Song dynasty  AD  960 1279   long regarded as one of the high points in the history of China s ceramic industry  The tradition of religious sculpture extends over most historical periods but is less clearly delineated than that of stonewares or porcelains  for it embraces the old custom of earthenware burial ceramics with later religious images and architectural ornament  Ceramic products also include lead glazed tomb models of the Han dynasty  three color lead glazed vessels and figures of the Tang dynasty  and Ming three color temple ornaments  in which the motifs were outlined in a raised trail of slip as well as the many burial ceramics produced in imitation of vessels made in materials of higher intrinsic value 
Trade between the West and the settled and prosperous Chinese dynasties introduced new forms and different technologies  One of the most far reaching examples is the impact of the fine ninth century AD  Chinese porcelain wares imported into the Arab world  So admired were these pieces that they encouraged the development of earthenware made in imitation of porcelain and instigated research into the method of their manufacture  From the Middle East the Chinese acquired a blue pigment a purified form of cobalt oxide unobtainable at that time in China that contained only a low level of manganese  Cobalt ores found in China have a high manganese content  which produces a more muted blue gray color  In the seventeenth century  the trading activities of the Dutch East India Company resulted in vast quantities of decorated Chinese porcelain being brought to Europe  which stimulated and influenced the work of a wide variety of wares  notably Delft  The Chinese themselves adapted many specific vessel forms from the West  such as bottles with long spouts  and designed a range of decorative patterns especially for the European market 
Just as painted designs on Greek pots may seem today to be purely decorative  whereas in fact they were carefully and precisely worked out so that at the time  their meaning was clear  so it is with Chinese pots  To twentieth century eyes  Chinese pottery may appear merely decorative  yet to the Chinese the form of each object and its adornment had meaning and significance  The dragon represented the emperor  and the phoenix  the empress  the pomegranate indicated fertility  and a pair of fish  happiness  mandarin ducks stood for wedded bliss  the pine tree  peach  and crane are emblems of long life  and fish leaping from waves indicated success in the civil service examinations  Only when European decorative themes were introduced did these meanings become obscured or even lost 
From early times pots were used in both religious and secular contexts  The imperial court commissioned work and in the Yuan dynasty  A D  1279 1368  an imperial ceramic factory was established at Jingdezhen  Pots played an important part in some religious ceremonies  Long and often lyrical descriptions of the different types of ware exist that assist in classifying pots  although these sometimes confuse an already large and complicated picture

4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 While stonewares and porcelains are found throughout most historical periods  religious sculpture is limited to the ancient period 
 Religious sculpture was created in most periods  but its history is less clear than that of stonewares or porcelains because some old forms continued to be used even when new ones were developed 
 While stonewares and porcelains changed throughout history  religious sculpture remained uniform in form and use 
 The historical development of religious sculpture is relatively unclear because religious sculptures sometimes resemble earthenware architectural ornaments 
5  Paragraph 3 supports all of the following concerning the history of the ceramic industry in China EXCEPT 
 The earliest high fired ceramics were of poor quality 
 Ceramics produced during the Tang and Ming dynasties sometimes incorporated multiple colors 
 Earthenware ceramics were produced in China before stonewares were

 Ceramics made in imperial factories were used in both religious and non religious contexts 
 

 
Variations in the Climate
One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate  We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention  We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected  and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways  We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities 
Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century  What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals  the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes  To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records 
Over long periods of time  substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime  sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years  Generally  the layering occurs on an annual basis  hence the observed changes in the records can be dated  Information on temperature  rainfall  and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data  Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap  calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe  ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean  ice cores from Peruvian glaciers  and ice cores from eastern Antarctica  While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale  there are nonetheless some intriguing differences  which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other 
What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years  Equally striking  however  is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10 000 years  the Holocene period  
To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability  it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined  These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere  the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans  changes in the land surfaces  and the extent of ice and snow  Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity  solar activity  and  possibly  human activities 
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate  They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability  Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records 
In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself  there is the added factor of external influences  such as volcanoes and solar activity  There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate  Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations  Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries  but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades 










1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following must we find out in order to determine the impact of human activities upon climate 
 The major changes in climate over the past millennia
 The degree to which the climate varies naturally
 The best method for measuring climatic change
 The millennium when humans began to interfere with the climate








2  According to paragraph 2  an advantage of proxy records over instrumental records is that 
 they are more reliable measures of climatic variability in the past century
 they provide more accurate measures of local temperatures
 they provide information on climate fluctuations further back in time
 they reveal information about the human impact on the climate
















3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Because physical and chemical properties of substances are unchanging  they are useful records of climate fluctuations over time 
 For hundreds or thousands of years  people have been observing changes in the chemical and physical properties of substances in order to infer climate change 
 Because it takes long periods of time for the climate to change  systematic changes in the properties of substances are difficult to observe 
 Changes in systematically deposited substances that are affected by climate can indicate climate variations over time

Seventeenth Century European Economic Growth
In the late sixteenth century and into the seventeenth  Europe continued the growth that had lifted it out of the relatively less prosperous medieval period  from the mid 400s to the late 1400s   Among the key factors behind this growth were increased agricultural productivity and an expansion of trade 
Populations cannot grow unless the rural economy can produce enough additional food to feed more people  During the sixteenth century  farmers brought more land into cultivation at the expense of forests and fens  low lying wetlands   Dutch land reclamation in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most spectacular example of the expansion of farmland  the Dutch reclaimed more than 36 000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone 
Much of the potential for European economic development lay in what at first glance would seem to have been only sleepy villages  Such villages  however  generally lay in regions of relatively advanced agricultural production  permitting not only the survival of peasants but also the accumulation of an agricultural surplus for investment  They had access to urban merchants  markets  and trade routes 
Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated rural industry  an intrinsic part of the expansion of industry  Woolens and textile manufacturers  in particular  utilized rural cottage  in home  production  which took advantage of cheap and plentiful rural labor  In the German states  the ravages of the Thirty Years  War  1618 1648  further moved textile production into the countryside  Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an attempt to supplement meager family income 
More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe s economy in this period  English and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal  Population growth generated an expansion of small scale manufacturing  particularly of handicrafts  textiles  and metal production in England  Flanders  parts of northern Italy  the southwestern German states  and parts of Spain  Only iron smelting and mining required marshaling a significant amount of capital  wealth invested to create more wealth  
The development of banking and other financial services contributed to the expansion of trade  By the middle of the sixteenth century  financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of exchange in place of gold or silver for other goods  Bills of exchange  which had their origins in medieval Italy  were promissory notes  written promises to pay a specified amount of money by a certain date  that could be sold to third parties  In this way  they provided credit  At mid century  an Antwerp financier only slightly exaggerated when he claimed   0ne can no more trade without bills of exchange than sail without water   Merchants no longer had to carry gold and silver over long  dangerous journeys  An Amsterdam merchant purchasing soap from a merchant in Marseille could go to an exchanger and pay the exchanger the equivalent sum in guilders  the Dutch currency  The exchanger would then send a bill of exchange to a colleague in Marseille  authorizing the colleague to pay the Marseille merchant in the merchant s own currency after the actual exchange of goods had taken place 
Bills of exchange contributed to the development of banks  as exchangers began to provide loans  Not until the   eighteenth century  however  did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment  Their principal function was to provide funds for the state 
The rapid expansion in international trade also benefitted from an infusion of capital  stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas  This capital financed the production of goods  storage  trade  and even credit across Europe and overseas  Moreover an increased credit supply was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint stock partnerships an English innovation  the first major company began in 1600   Unlike short term financial cooperation between investors for a single commercial undertaking  joint stock companies provided permanent funding of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the company 











1  According to paragraph 1  what was true of Europe during the medieval period  
 Agricultural productivity declined 
 There was relatively little economic growth 
 The general level of prosperity declined 
 Foreign trade began to play an important role in the economy 

2  The word key in the passage is closest in meaning to
 historical
 many

3  According to paragraph 2  one effect of the desire to increase food production was that
 land was cultivated in a different way
 more farmers were needed
 the rural economy was weakened
 forests and wetlands were used for farming
















4  According to paragraph 3  what was one reason villages had such great economic potential 
 Villages were located in regions where agricultural production was relatively advanced 
 Villages were relatively small in population and size compared with urban areas 
 Some village inhabitants made investments in industrial development 
 Village inhabitants established markets within their villages 


5  Paragraph 4 supports the idea that increased agricultural production was important for the expansion of industry primarily because it
 increased the number of available workers in rural areas
 provided new types of raw materials for use by industry
 resulted in an improvement in the health of the rural cottage workers used by manufacturers
 helped repair some of the ravages of the Thirty Years  War

6  The word  meager  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 very necessary
 very low
 traditional
 primary



7  Why does the author mention that  English and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal  
 To suggest that England and the Netherlands were the two most important trading nations in seventeenth century Europe
 To suggest how extensive trading relations were
 To contrast the importance of agricultural products with manufactured products
 To argue that shipping introduced a range of new products








8  By including the quotation in paragraph 6 by the financier from Antwerp  the author is emphasizing that 
 sailing was an important aspect of the economy
 increasing the number of water routes made trade possible
 bills of exchange were necessary for successful trading
 financiers often exaggerated the need for bills of exchange


9  According to paragraph 6  merchants were able to avoid the risk of carrying large amounts of gold and silver by 
 using third parties in Marseille to buy goods for them
 doing all their business by using Dutch currency
 paying for their purchases through bills of exchange
 waiting to pay for goods until the goods had been delivered







10  According to paragraph 7  until the eighteenth century  it was the principal function of which of the following to provide funds for the state  
 Bills of exchange
 Exchangers who took loans
 Banks
 Business investment








11  The phrase  an English innovation  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 a new development introduced by the English
 an arrangement found only in England
 a type of agreement negotiated in English
 a type of partnership based on English law


12  According to paragraph 8  each of the following was a source of funds used to finance economic expansion 
EXCEPT 
 groups of investors engaged in short term financial cooperation
 the state
 wealthy merchants
 joint stock companies

In late sixteenth and early seventeenth century Europe  increased agricultural production and the expansion of trade were important in economic growth 
 
 
 










Answer choices

 Bringing more land under cultivation produced enough food to create surpluses for trade and investment as well as for supporting the larger populations that led to the growth of rural industry 
 Most rural villages established an arrangement with a nearby urban center that enabled villagers to take advantage of urban markets to sell any handicrafts they produced 
 Increases in population and the expansion of trade led to increased manufacturing  much of it small scale in character but some requiring significant capital investment 
 Increased capital was required for the production of goods  for storage  for trade  and for the provision of credit throughout of Europe as well as distant markets overseas 
 Bills of exchange were invented in medieval Italy but became less important as banks began to provide loans for merchants 
 The expansion of trade was facilitated by developments in banking and financial services and benefitted from the huge influx of capital in the form of gold silver from the Americas

Ancient Egyptian Sculpture
In order to understand ancient Egyptian art  it is vital to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians  view of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them  Without this knowledge we can appreciate only the formal content of Egyptian art  and we will fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts that shaped it and caused it to adopt its distinctive forms  In fact  a lack of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures  Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in which the body turned and twisted through space like classical Greek statuary  Why do the artists seem to get left and right confused  And why did they not discover the geometric perspective as European artists did in the Renaissance  The answer to such questions has nothing to do with a lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists and everything to do with the purposes for which they were producing their art  
The majority of three dimensional representations  whether standing  seated  or kneeling  exhibit what is called frontality  they face straight ahead  neither twisting nor turning  When such statues are viewed in isolation  out of their original context and without knowledge of their function  it is easy to criticize them for their rigid attitudes that remained unchanged for three thousand years  Frontality is  however  directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up  Statues were created not for their decorative effect but to play a primary role in the cults of the gods  the king  and the dead  They were designed to be put in places where these beings could manifest themselves in order to be the recipients of ritual actions  Thus it made sense to show the statue looking ahead at what was happening in front of it  so that the living performer of the ritual could interact with the divine or deceased recipient  Very often such statues were enclosed in rectangular shrines or wall niches whose only opening was at the front  making it natural for the statue to display frontality  Other statues were designed to be placed within an architectural setting  for instance  in front of the monumental entrance gateways to temples known as pylons  or in pillared courts  where they would be placed against or between pillars  their frontality worked perfectly within the architectural context 
Statues were normally made of stone  wood  or metal  Stone statues were worked from single rectangular blocks of material and retained the compactness of the original shape  The stone between the arms and the body and between the legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in seated ones was not normally cut away  From a practical aspect this protected the figures against breakage and psychologically gives the images a sense of strength and power  usually enhanced by a supporting back pillar  By contrast  wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished work  and metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden core or cast by the lost wax process  The arms could be held away from the body and carry separate items in their hands  there is no back pillar  The effect is altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in stone  but because both perform the same function  formal wooden and metal statues still display frontality 
Apart from statues representing deities  kings  and named members of the elite that can be called formal  there is another group of three dimensional representations that depicts generic figures  frequently servants  from the nonelite population  The function of these is quite different  Many are made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to serve the tomb owners in the afterlife  Unlike formal statues that are limited to static poses of standing  sitting  and kneeling  these figures depict a wide range of actions  such as grinding grain  baking bread  producing pots  and making music  and they are shown in appropriate poses  bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks

The distinctive look of ancient Egyptian sculpture was determined largely by its function 
 
 
 


Answer Choices


 The twisted forms of Egyptian statues indicate their importance in ritual actions 
 The reason Egyptian statues are motionless is linked to their central role in cultural rituals 
 Stone  wood  and metal statues all display the feature of frontality 
 Statues were more often designed to be viewed in isolation rather than placed within buildings 
 The contrasting poses used in statues of elite and nonelite Egyptians reveal their difference in social status 
 Although the appearances of formal and generic statues differ  they share the same function 

















Orientation and Navigation

To South Americans  robins are birds that fly north every spring  To North Americans  the robins simply vacation in the south each winter  Furthermore  they fly to very specific places in South America and will often come back to the same trees in North American yards the following spring  The question is not why they would leave the cold of winter so much as how they find their way around  The question perplexed people for years  until  in the 1950s  a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and  in the process  raised new questions 
Kramer initiated important new kinds of research regarding how animals orient and navigate  Orientation is simply facing in the right direction  navigation involves finding ones way from point A to point B 
Early in his research  Kramer found that caged migratory birds became very restless at about the time they would normally have begun migration in the wild  Furthermore  he noticed that as they fluttered around in the cage  they often launched themselves in the direction of their normal migratory route  He then set up experiments with caged starlings and found that their orientation was  in fact  in the proper migratory direction except when the sky was overcast  at which times there was no clear direction to their restless movements  Kramer surmised  therefore  that they were orienting according to the position of the Sun  To test this idea  he blocked their view of the Sun and used mirrors to change its apparent position  He found that under these circumstances  the birds oriented with respect to the new  Sun   They seemed to be using the Sun as a compass to determine direction  At the time  this idea seemed preposterous  How could a bird navigate by the Sun when some of us lose our way with road maps  Obviously  more testing was in order 
So  in another set of experiments  Kramer put identical food boxes around the cage  with food in only one of the boxes  The boxes were stationary  and the one containing food was always at the same point of the compass  However  its position with respect to the surroundings could be changed by revolving either the inner cage containing the birds or the outer walls  which served as the background  As long as the birds could see the Sun  no matter how their surroundings were altered  they went directly to the correct food box  Whether the box appeared in front of the right wall or the left wall  they showed no signs of confusion  On overcast days  however  the birds were disoriented and had trouble locating their food box 
In experimenting with artificial suns  Kramer made another interesting discovery  If the artificial Sun remained stationary  the birds would shift their direction with respect to it at a rate of about 15 degrees per hour  the Sun s rate of movement across the sky  Apparently  the birds were assuming that the  Sun  they saw was moving at that rate  When the real Sun was visible  however  the birds maintained a constant direction as it moved across the sky  In other words  they were able to compensate for the Sun s movement  This meant that some sort of biological clock was operating and a very precise clock at that 
What about birds that migrate at night  Perhaps they navigate by the night sky  To test the idea  caged night migrating birds were placed on the floor of a planetarium during their migratory period  A planetarium is essentially a theater with a domelike ceiling onto which a night sky can be projected for any night of the year  When the planetarium sky matched the sky outside  the birds fluttered in the direction of their normal migration  But when the dome was rotated  the birds changed their direction to match the artificial sky  The results clearly indicated that the birds were orienting according to the stars 
There is accumulating evidence indicating that birds navigate by using a wide variety of environmental cues  Other areas under investigation include magnetism  landmarks  coastlines  sonar  and even smells  The studies are complicated by the fact that the data are sometimes contradictory and the mechanisms apparently change from time to time  Furthermore  one sensory ability may back up another 
















1  Which of the following can be inferred about bird migration from paragraph 1 
 Birds will take the most direct migratory route to their new habitat 
 The purpose of migration is to join with larger groups of birds 
 Bird migration generally involves moving back and forth between north and south 
 The destination of birds  migration can change from year to year 



2  The word  perplexed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 defeated
 interested
 puzzled
 occupied
















3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Experiments revealed that caged starlings displayed a lack of directional sense and restless movements 
 Experiments revealed that caged starlings were unable to orient themselves in the direction of their normal migratory route 
 Experiments revealed that the restless movement of caged starlings had no clear direction 
 Experiments revealed that caged starlings  orientation was accurate unless the weather was overcast 


4  The word  preposterous  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 unbelievable
 inadequate
 limited
 creative

5  According to paragraph 3  why did Kramer use mirrors to change the apparent position of the Sun 
 To test the effect of light on the birds  restlessness
 To test whether birds were using the Sun to navigate
 To simulate the shifting of light the birds would encounter along their regular migratory route
 To cause the birds to migrate at a different time than they would in the wild

6  According to paragraph 3  when do caged starlings become restless 
 When the weather is overcast
 When they are unable to identify their normal migratory route
 When their normal time for migration arrives
 When mirrors are used to change the apparent position of the Sun










7  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about Kramer s reason for filling one food box and leaving the rest empty  
 He believed the birds would eat food from only one box 
 He wanted to see whether the Sun alone controlled the birds  ability to navigate toward the box with food 
 He thought that if all the boxes contained food  this would distract the birds from following their migratory route 
 He needed to test whether the birds preferred having the food at any particular point of the compass 




8  According to paragraph 5  how did the birds fly when the real Sun was visible 
 They kept the direction of their flight constant 
 They changed the direction of their flight at a rate of 15 degrees per hour 
 They kept flying toward the Sun 
 They flew in the same direction as the birds that were seeing the artificial Sun 

9  The experiment described in paragraph 5 caused Kramer to conclude that birds possess a biological clock because 
 when birds navigate they are able to compensate for the changing position of the Sun in the sky
 birds innate bearings keep them oriented in a direction that is within 15 degrees of the Suns direction
 birds  migration is triggered by natural environmental cues  such as the position of the Sun
 birds shift their direction at a rate of 15 degrees per hour whether the Sun is visible or not










10  According to paragraph 6  how did the birds navigate in the planetarium s nighttime environment 
 By waiting for the dome to stop rotating
 By their position on the planetarium floor
 By orienting themselves to the stars in the artificial night sky
 By navigating randomly until they found the correct orientation

11  Which of the following best describes the author s presentation of information in the passage  
 A number of experiments are described to support the idea that birds use the Sun and the night sky to navigate 
 The author uses logic to show that the biological clock in birds is inaccurate 
 A structured argument about the importance of internal versus external cues for navigation is presented 
 The opposing points of view about bird migration are clarified through the study of contrasting experiments 



12  The word  accumulating  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 new
 increasing
 convincing
 extensive



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage

Gustave Kramer conducted important research related to the ability of birds to orient and navigate 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Because caged birds become disoriented when the sky is overcast  Kramer hypothesized that birds orient themselves according to the Sun s position 
 In one set of experiments  Kramer placed the box containing food at the same point of the compass each time he put food boxes in the birds  environment  
 Kramer demonstrated that an internal biological clock allows starlings to compensate for the Sun s movement 
 After several studies  Kramer surmised that an internal biological clock allows some species of birds to navigate at night 
 The role of environmental cues in birds  navigation is clear  for on overcast days  birds use objects besides the Sun to orient themselves 
 Kramer showed that night migrating birds use the sky to navigate by the stars 
 

Begging by Nestlings
Many signals that animals make seem to impose on the signalers costs that are overly damaging  A classic example is noisy begging by nestling songbirds when a parent returns to the nest with food  These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the nest away to a listening hawk or raccoon  resulting in the death of the defenseless nestlings  In fact  when tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest containing an egg  the egg in that  noisy  nest was taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a nearby quiet nest in 29 of 37 trials 

Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees  The young of ground nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree nesting relatives  These higher frequency sounds do not travel as far  and so may better conceal the individuals producing them  who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground nests  David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree nesting or of ground nesting warblers  The eggs  advertised  by the tree nesters  begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground nesters  calls 

The hypothesis that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their potential for attracting predators yields a prediction  baby birds of species that experience high rates of nest predation should produce softer begging signals of higher frequency than nestlings of other species less often victimized by nest predators  This prediction was supported by data collected in one survey of 24 species from an Arizona forest  more evidence that predator pressure favors the evolution of begging calls that are hard to detect and pinpoint 

Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food  what benefit do begging nestlings derive from their communications  One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate signals of its real hunger and good health  making it worthwhile for the listening parent to give it food in a nest where several other offspring are usually available to be fed  If this hypothesis is true  then it follows that nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals produced by their nestmates  who are competing for parental attention  When experimentally deprived baby robins are placed in a nest with normally fed siblings  the hungry nestlings beg more loudly than usual but so do their better fed siblings  though not as loudly as the hungrier birds 

If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy offspring capable of vigorous begging  then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offsprings  calls  Indeed  if you take baby tree swallows out of a nest for an hour feeding half the set and starving the other half  when the birds are replaced in the nest  the starved youngsters beg more loudly than the fed birds  and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less vigorously 

As these experiments show  begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding  But the question arises  why don t nestlings beg loudly when they aren t all that hungry  By doing so  they could possibly secure more food  which should result in more rapid growth or larger size  either of which is advantageous  The answer lies apparently not in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories but rather in the damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings  which share genes with one another  An individual s success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own personal reproductive success  Because close relatives have many of the same genes  animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes  Therefore  a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise

2  According to paragraph 1  the experiment with tapes of begging tree swallows establishes which of the following 
 Begging by nestling birds can attract the attention of predators to the nest 
 Nest predators attack nests that contain nestlings more frequently than they attack nests that contain only eggs 
 Tapes of begging nestlings attract predators to the nest less frequently than real begging calls do 
 Nest predators have no other means of locating bird nests except the begging calls of nestling birds 


3  The word  artificial  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 attractive
 not real
 short term

4  Paragraph 2 indicates that the begging calls of tree nesting warblers
 put them at more risk than ground nesting warblers experience
 can be heard from a greater distance than those of ground nesting warblers
 are more likely to conceal the signaler than those of ground nesting warblers
 have higher frequencies than those of ground nesting warblers

5  The experiment described in paragraph 2 supports which of the following conclusions  
 Predators are unable to distinguish between the begging cheeps of ground nesting and those of tree nesting warblers except by the differing frequencies of the calls 
 When they can find them  predators prefer the eggs of tree nesting warblers to those of ground nesting warblers 
 The higher frequencies of the begging cheeps of ground nesting warblers are an adaptation to the threat that ground nesting birds face from predators 
 The danger of begging depends more on the frequency of the begging cheep than on how loud it is

9  In paragraphs 4 and 5  what evidence supports the claim that the intensity of nestling begging calls is a good indicator of which offspring in a nest would most benefit from a feeding  
 When placed in a nest with hungry robins  well fed robins did not beg for food 
 Among robin nestlings  the intensity of begging decreased the more the nestlings were fed 
 Hungry tree swallow nestlings begged louder than well fed nestlings in the same nest 
 Hungry tree swallow nestlings continued to beg loudly until they were fed whereas well fed nestlings soon stopped begging 



10  It can be inferred from paragraphs 4 and 5 that parent songbirds normally do not feed
 nestlings that are too weak to beg for food as vigorously as their nestmates
 more than one hungry nestling during a single visit to the nest
 offspring that were fed by the parents on the previous visit to the nest
 nestlings that have been removed and then later put back into their nest

















11  In paragraph 6  the author compares the energy costs of vigorous begging with the potential gain in calories from such begging in order to
 explain why begging for food vigorously can lead to faster growth and increased size
 explain how begging vigorously can increase an individual s chance of propagating its own genes
 point out a weakness in a possible explanation for why nestlings do not always beg vigorously
 argue that the benefits of vigorous begging outweigh any possible disadvantages


12  According to paragraph 6  which of the following explains the fact that a well fed nestling does not beg loudly for more food 
 There is no benefit for a nestling to get more food than it needs to survive 
 By begging loudly for food it does not need  a nestling would unnecessarily expose itself to danger from predators 
 If a nestling begs loudly when it is not truly hungry  then when it is truly hungry its own begging may be drowned out by that of its well fed siblings 
 More of a nestling s genes will be passed to the next generation if its hungry siblings get enough food to survive 


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage  
The cheeping provides important information to the parent  but it could also attract the attention of others

Experiments have shed much light on the begging behaviors of baby songbirds 
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Songbird species that are especially vulnerable to predators have evolved ways of reducing the dangers associated with begging calls  
 Songbird parents focus their feeding effort on the nestlings that beg loudest for food 
 It is genetically disadvantageous for nestlings to behave as if they are really hungry when they are not really hungry 
 The begging calls of songbird nestlings provide a good example of overly damaging cost to signalers of signaling  
 The success with which songbird nestlings communicate their hunger to their parents is dependent on the frequencies of the nestlings  begging calls 
 Songbird nestlings have evolved several different ways to communicate the intensity of their hunger to their parents

Which Hand Did They Use 

We all know that many more people today are right handed than left handed  Can one trace this same pattern far back in prehistory  Much of the evidence about right hand versus left hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere  and in many Ice Age caves in France  Spain  and Tasmania  When a left hand has been stenciled  this implies that the artist was right handed  and vice versa  Even though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth  one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation  One also has to make the assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward a left hand stenciled palm upward might of course look as if it were a right hand  Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas  136 have been identified as left  and only 22 as right  right handedness was therefore heavily predominant 
Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon  Most engravings  for example  are best lit from the left  as befits the work of right handed artists  who generally prefer to have the light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving tool or brush  In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something  it is mostly  though not always  in the right hand 
Clues to right handedness can also be found by other methods  Right handers tend to have longer  stronger  and more muscular bones on the right side  and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911 noted the La Chapelle aux Saints Neanderthal skeleton had a right upper arm bone that was noticeably stronger than the left  Similar observations have been made on other Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself 
Fractures and other cut marks are another source of evidence  Right handed soldiers tend to be wounded on the left  The skeleton of a 40  or 50 year old Nabatean warrior  buried 2 000 years ago in the Negev Desert  Israel  had multiple healed fractures to the skull  the left arm  and the ribs 
Tools themselves can be revealing  Long handed Neolithic spoons of yew wood preserved in Alpine villages dating to 3000 B C  have survived  the signs of rubbing on their left side indicate that their users were right handed  The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right  and was therefore tressed by a righthander 
Occasionally one can determine whether stone tools were used in the right hand or the left  and it is even possible to assess how far back this feature can be traced  In stone toolmaking experiments  Nick Toth  a right hander  held the core  the stone that would become the tool  in his left hand and the hammer stone in his right  As the tool was made  the core was rotated clockwise  and the flakes  removed in sequence  had a little crescent of cortex  the core s outer surface  on the side  Toth s knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the cortex on the right  and 44 percent left oriented flakes  A left handed toolmaker would produce the opposite pattern  Toth has applied these criteria to the similarly made pebble tools from a number of early sites  before 1 5 million years  at Koobi Fora  Kenya  probably made by Homo habilis  At seven sites he found that 57 percent of the flakes were right oriented  and 43 percent left  a   pattern almost identical to that produced today 
About 90 percent of modern humans are right handed  we are the only mammal with a preferential use of one hand  The part of the brain responsible for fine control and movement is located in the left cerebral hemisphere  and the findings above suggest that the human brain was already asymmetrical in its structure and function not long after 2 million years ago  Among Neanderthalers of 70 000–35 000 years ago  Marcellin Boule noted that the La Chapelle aux Saints individual had a left hemisphere slightly bigger than the right  and the same was found for brains of specimens from Neanderthal  Gibraltar  and La Quina

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that even when paint was sprayed by mouth to make a hand stencil 
 there was no way to tell which hand was stenciled
 the stenciled hand was the weaker hand
 the stenciled hand was the dominant hand
 artists stenciled more images of the dominant hand than they did of the weak

4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the      passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 	Right handed artists could more easily have avoided casting shadows on their work  because engravings in        prehistoric caves were lit from the left 
 	The tips of engraving tools and brushes indicate that these instruments were used by right handed artists whose work was lit from the left 
 	The best lighting for most engravings suggests that they were made by right handed people trying to avoid the shadow of their hands interfering with their work 
 Right handed artists try to avoid having the brush they are using interfere with the light source 



5．All of the following are mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 as evidence of right handedness in art and artists EXCEPT 
 the ideal source of lighting for most engravings
 the fact that a left hand stenciled palm upward might look like a right hand
 the prevalence of outlines of left hands

6  According to paragraph 3  the La Chapelle aux Saints Neanderthal skeleton can be identified as right handed because  
 other Neanderthal skeletons found nearby are also right handed
 the right arm bone is stronger than the left
 it is similar to skeletons of La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal
 the right side of the skeleton shows less evidence of fractures


7  Which of the following statements about fractures and cut marks can be inferred from paragraph 4 
 Fractures and cut marks caused by right handed soldiers tend to occur on the right side of the injured party s body 
 The right arm sustains more injuries because  as the dominant arm  it is used more actively 
 In most people  the left side of the body is more vulnerable to injury since it is not defended effectively by the dominant arm 
 Fractures and cut marks on fossil humans probably occurred after death 

8  According to paragraph 5  what characteristic of a Neolithic spoon would imply that the spoon s owner was right handed

 Stencils of right handed figures are characteristic of cave art in France  Spain  and Tasmania 
 Signs on the skeletal remains of prehistoric figures  including arm bone size and injury marks  imply that these are the remains of right handed people 
 Instruments such as spoons  ropes  and pebble tools show signs that indicate they were used or constructed by right handed people 
 The amount of prehistoric art created by right handed artists indicates that left handed people were in the minority 
 Neanderthal skeletons often have longer finger bones in the right hand  which is evidence that the right hand was stronger 
 Nick Toth  a modem right handed toolmaker has shown that prehistoric tools were knapped to fit the right hand 












Transition to Sound in Film
The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the 1920s marks  so far  the most important transformation in motion picture history  Despite all the highly visible technological developments in theatrical and home delivery of the moving image that have occurred over the decades since then  no single innovation has come close to being regarded as a similar kind of watershed  In nearly every language  however the words are phrased  the most basic division in cinema history lies between films that are mute and films that speak 
Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of paradoxes  Nearly every movie theater  however modest  had a piano or organ to provide musical accompaniment to silent pictures  In many instances  spectators in the era before recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations alongside movies  visual images  from the Japanese benshi  narrators  crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical compositions performed by symphony size orchestras in Europe and the United States  In Berlin  for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin  film director Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel  1874 1930  on a musical score matching sound to image  the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the film its wide international fame 
Beyond that  the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s  New color processes  larger or differently shaped screen sizes  multiple screen projections  even television  were among the developments invented or tried out during the period  sometimes with startling success  The high costs of converting to sound and the early limitations of sound technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas  The introduction of new screen formats was put off for a quarter century  and color  though utilized over the next two decades for special productions  also did not become a norm until the 1950s 
Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective  a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight  just as had many previous attempts  dating well back before the First World War  to link images with recorded sound  These critics were making a common assumption that the technological inadequacies of earlier efforts  poor synchronization  weak sound amplification  fragile sound recordings  would invariably occur again  To be sure  their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s sound experiments was not so far off the mark  yet they neglected to take into account important new forces in the motion picture field that  in a sense  would not take no for an answer 
These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s  In the United States  they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph  General Electric  and Westinghouse  They were interested in all forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commercial exploitation  Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting industry in the United States  beginning with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the early 1920s  With financial assets considerably greater than those in the motion picture industry  and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships among entertainment and communications media  they revitalized research into recording sound for motion pictures 
  In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released more than 300 sound films a rough figure  since a number were silent films with music tracks  or films prepared in dual versions  to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound  At the production level  in the United States the conversion was virtually complete by 1930  In Europe it took a little longer  mainly because there were more small producers for whom the costs of sound were prohibitive  and in other parts of the world problems with rights or access to equipment delayed the shift to sound production for a few more years  though cinemas in major cities may have been wired in order to play foreign sound films   The triumph of sound cinema was swift  complete  and enormously popular

 The film was not accompanied by sound before its Berlin screening 
 The film was unpopular in the Soviet Union before it was screened in Berlin 
 Eisenstein s film was the first instance of collaboration between a director and a composer 
 Eisenstein believed that the musical score in a film was as important as dialogue

7  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is NOT true of the technological and aesthetic experiments of the 1920 s 
 Because the costs of introducing recorded sound were low  it was the only innovation that was put to use in the 1920 s 
 The introduction of recorded sound prevented the development of other technological innovations in the 1920 s 
 The new technological and aesthetic developments of the 1920s included the use of color  new screen formats  and television 
 Many of the innovations developed in the 1920s were not widely introduced until as late as the 1950 s 
















8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 It was difficult for some critics in the 1920s to imagine why the idea of sound film had faded from sight well before the First World War 
 As surprising as it seems today  some critics in the 1920s believed that the new attempts at sound films would fade just as quickly as the attempts made before the First World War 
 Though some early critics thought that sound film would fade  its popularity during the First World War proved that it was not simply a technical novelty 
 Although some critics predicted well before the First World War that sound film would be an important technical innovation  it was not attempted until the 1920s

10  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true about the technical problems of early sound films 
 Linking images with recorded sound was a larger obstacle than weak sound amplification or fragile sound recordings 
 Sound films in the 1920s were unable to solve the technical flaws found in sound films before the First World War 
 Technical inadequacies occurred less frequently in early sound films than critics suggested 
 Critics assumed that it would be impossible to overcome the technical difficulties experienced with earlier sound films 

11  In paragraph 5  commercial radio programming is best described as the result of 
 a financially successful development that enabled large telecommunications firms to weaken their competition

 a major development in the broadcasting industry that occurred before the 1920s
 the cooperation between telecommunications companies and the motion picture industry





12  According to paragraph 6  which of the following accounts for the delay in the conversion to sound films in Europe  
 European producers often lacked knowledge about the necessary equipment for the transition to sound films 
 Smaller European producers were often unable to afford to add sound to their films 
 It was often difficult to wire older cinemas in the major cities to play sound films 
 Smaller European producers believed that silent films with music accompaniment were aesthetically superior to sound films

The transition from silent to sound films was the most important development in film history 
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Although music and speech had frequently accompanied film presentations before the 1920s  there was a strong desire to add sound to the films themselves 
 Because of intense interest in developing and introducing sound in film  the general use of other technological innovations being developed in the 1920s was delayed 
 The rapid progress in sound technology made possible by the involvement of telecommunications companies transformed the motion picture industry 
 Japanese filmmakers had developed the technology for creating sound films before directors in Europe and the United States began experimenting with sound 
 Before the First World War  film directors showed little interest in linking images with recorded sound 
 The arrival of sound film technology in the United States forced smaller producers in the motion picture industry out of business 


























 
Water in the Desert
Rainfall is not completely absent in desert areas  but it is highly variable  An annual rainfall of four inches is often used to define the limits of a desert  The impact of rainfall upon the surface water and groundwater resources of the desert is greatly influenced by landforms  Flats and depressions where water can collect are common features  but they make up only a small part of the landscape 
Arid lands  surprisingly  contain some of the world s largest river systems  such as the Murray Darling in Australia  the Rio Grande in North America  the Indus in Asia  and the Nile in Africa  These rivers and river systems are known as  exogenous  because their sources lie outside the arid zone  They are vital for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world  For centuries  the annual floods of the Nile  Tigris  and Euphrates  for example  have brought fertile silts and water to the inhabitants of their lower valleys  Today  river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention  creating a need for international river basin agreements  The filling of the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey has drastically reduced flows in the Euphrates  with potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq 
The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the season  The desert sections of long rivers respond several months after rain has fallen outside the desert  so that peak flows may be in the dry season  This is useful for irrigation  but the high temperatures  low humidities  and different day lengths of the dry season  compared to the normal growing season  can present difficulties with some crops 
Regularly flowing rivers and streams that originate within arid lands are known as  endogenous   These are generally fed by groundwater springs  and many issue from limestone massifs  such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco  Basaltic rocks also support springs  notably at the Jabal Al Arab on the Jordan Syria border  Endogenous rivers often do not reach the sea but drain into inland basins  where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground  Most desert streambeds are normally dry  but they occasionally receive large flows of water and sediment 
Deserts contain large amounts of groundwater when compared to the amounts they hold in surface stores such as lakes and rivers  But only a small fraction of groundwater enters the hydrological cycle feeding the flows of streams  maintaining lake levels  and being recharged  or refilled  through surface flows and rainwater  In recent years  groundwater has become an increasingly important source of freshwater for desert dwellers  The United Nations Environment Programme and the World Bank have funded attempts to survey the groundwater resources of arid lands and to develop appropriate extraction techniques  Such programs are much needed because in many arid lands there is only a vague idea of the extent of groundwater resources  It is known  however  that the distribution of groundwater is uneven  and that much of it lies at great depths 
Groundwater is stored in the pore spaces and joints of rocks and unconsolidated  unsolidified  sediments or in the openings widened through fractures and weathering  The water saturated rock or sediment is known as an  aquifer   Because they are porous  sedimentary rocks  such as sandstones and conglomerates  are important potential sources of groundwater  Large quantities of water may also be stored in limestones when joints and cracks have been enlarged to form cavities  Most limestone and sandstone aquifers are deep and extensive but may contain groundwaters that are not being recharged  Most shallow aquifers in sand and gravel deposits produce lower yields  but they can be rapidly recharged  Some deep aquifers are known as  fossil waters  The term  fossil  describes water that has been present for several thousand years  These aquifers became saturated more than 10 000 years ago and are no longer being recharged 
Water does not remain immobile in an aquifer but can seep out at springs or leak into other aquifers  The rate of movement may be very slow  in the Indus plain  the movement of saline  salty  groundwaters has still not reached equilibrium after 70 years of being tapped  The mineral content of groundwater normally increases with the depth  but even quite shallow aquifers can be highly saline 








1  Which of the following statements about annual rainfall can be inferred from paragraph 1 
 Flat desert areas receive more annual rainfall than desert areas with mountains 
 Areas that receive more than four inches of rain per year are not considered deserts 
 Many areas receive less than four inches of annual rainfall  but only a few are deserts 
 Annual rainfall has no impact on the groundwater resources of desert areas

 Groundwater in deep aquifers is more likely to be recharged than groundwater in shallow aquifers
 Sedimentary rocks  because they are porous  are not capable of storing large amounts of groundwater
  9  According to paragraph 6  the aquifers called fossil waters

Types of Social Groups
Life places us in a complex web of relationships with other people  Our humanness arises out of these relationships in the course of social interaction  Moreover  our humanness must be sustained through social interaction and fairly constantly so  When an association continues long enough for two people to become linked together by a relatively stable set of expectations  it is called a relationship 
People are bound within relationships by two types of bonds  expressive ties and instrumental ties  Expressive ties are social links formed when we emotionally invest ourselves in and commit ourselves to other people  Through association with people who are meaningful to us  we achieve a sense of security  love  acceptance  companionship  and personal worth  Instrumental ties are social links formed when we cooperate with other people to achieve some goal  Occasionally  this may mean working with instead of against competitors  More often  we simply cooperate with others to reach some end without endowing the relationship with any larger significance 
Sociologists have built on the distinction between expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish between two types of groups  primary and secondary  A primary group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct  intimate  cohesive relationship with one another  Expressive ties predominate in primary groups  we view the people as ends in themselves and valuable in their own right  A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an impersonal relationship and have come together for a specific  practical purpose  Instrumental ties predominate in secondary groups  we perceive people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right  Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships  This happens in many work settings  People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes  jokes  gossip  and satisfactions 
A number of conditions enhance the likelihood that primary groups will arise  First  group size is important  We find it difficult to get to know people personally when they are milling about and dispersed in large groups  In small groups we have a better chance to initiate contact and establish rapport with them  Second  face to face contact allows us to size up others  Seeing and talking with one another in close physical proximity makes possible a subtle exchange of ideas and feelings  And third  the probability that we will develop primary group bonds increases as we have frequent and continuous contact  Our ties with people often deepen as we interact with them across time and gradually evolve interlocking habits and interests 
Primary groups are fundamental to us and to society  First  primary groups are critical to the socialization process  Within them  infants and children are introduced to the ways of their society  Such groups are the breeding grounds in which we acquire the norms and values that equip us for social life  Sociologists view primary groups as bridges between individuals and the larger society because they transmit  mediate  and interpret a society s cultural patterns and provide the sense of oneness so critical for social solidarity 
Second  primary groups are fundamental because they provide the settings in which we meet most of our personal needs  Within them  we experience companionship  love  security  and an overall sense of well being  Not surprisingly  sociologists find that the strength of a group s primary ties has implications for the group s functioning  For example  the stronger the primary group ties of a sports team playing together  the better their record is 
Third  primary groups are fundamental because they serve as powerful instruments for social control  Their members command and dispense many of the rewards that are so vital to us and that make our lives seem worthwhile  Should the use of rewards fail  members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who deviate from the primary group s norms  For instance  some social groups employ shunning  a person can remain in the community  but others are forbidden to interact with the person  as a device to bring into line individuals whose behavior goes beyond that allowed by the particular group  Even more important  primary groups define social reality for us by structuring our experiences  By providing us with definitions of situations  they elicit from our behavior that conforms to group devised meanings  Primary groups  then  serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them

Biological Clocks

Survival and successful reproduction usually require the activities of animals to be coordinated with predictable events around them  Consequently  the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely match periodic events like the solar day  the tides  the lunar cycle  and the seasons  The relations between animal activity and these periods  particularly for the daily rhythms  have been of such interest and importance that a huge amount of work has been done on them and the special research field of chronobiology has emerged  Normally  the constantly changing levels of an animal s activity sleeping  feeding  moving  reproducing  metabolizing  and producing enzymes and hormones  for example are well coordinated with environmental rhythms  but the key question is whether the animal s schedule is driven by external cues  such as sunrise or sunset  or is instead dependent somehow on internal timers that themselves generate the observed biological rhythms  Almost universally  biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes  a category that includes most organisms except bacteria and certain algae  have internal clocks  By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues  biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks  For instance  apparently normal daily periods of biological activity were maintained for about a week by the fungus Neurospora when it was intentionally isolated from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a space shuttle  The continuation of biological rhythms in an organism without external cues attests to its having an internal clock 

When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark  even for four to five months  their compound eyes continue to adjust on a daily schedule for daytime and nighttime vision  Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to maintain a persistent rhythm of brain activity that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily schedule for bright or for weak light  Like almost all daily cycles of animals deprived of environmental cues  those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were not exactly 24 hours  Such a rhythm whose period is approximately but not exactly a day is called circadian  For different individual horseshoe crabs  the circadian period ranged from 22 2 to 25 5 hours  A particular animal typically maintains its own characteristic cycle duration with great precision for many days  Indeed  stability of the biological clock s period is one of its major features  even when the organism s environment is subjected to considerable changes in factors  such as temperature  that would be expected to affect biological activity strongly  Further evidence for persistent internal rhythms appears when the usual external cycles are shifted either experimentally or by rapid east west travel over great distances  Typically  the animal s daily internally generated cycle of activity continues without change  As a result  its activities are shifted relative to the external cycle of the new environment  The disorienting effects of this mismatch between external time cues and internal schedules may persist  like our jet lag  for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight darkness cycle reset the organism s clock to synchronize with the daily rhythm of the new environment 

Animals need natural periodic signals like sunrise to maintain a cycle whose period is precisely 24 hours  Such an external cue not only coordinates an animal s daily rhythms with particular features of the local solar day but also because it normally does so day after day seems to keep the internal clock s period close to that of Earth s rotation  Yet despite this synchronization of the period of the internal cycle  the animal s timer itself continues to have its own genetically built in period close to  but different from  24 hours  Without the external cue  the difference accumulates and so the internally regulated activities of the biological day drift continuously  like the tides  in relation to the solar day  This drift has been studied extensively in many animals and in biological activities ranging from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running by squirrels  Light has a predominating influence in setting the clock  Even a fifteen minute burst of light in otherwise sustained darkness can reset an animal s circadian rhythm  Normally  internal rhythms are kept in step by regular environmental cycles  For instance  if a homing pigeon is to navigate with its Sun compass  its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight darkness cycle

The activity of animals is usually coordinated with periodically recurring events in the environment 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Most animals survive and reproduce successfully without coordinating their activities to external environmental rhythms 
 The circadian period of an animal s internal clock is genetically determined and basically unchangeable 
 Environmental cues such as a change in temperature are enough to reset an animal s clock 
 Animals have internal clocks that influence their activities even when environmental cues are absent 
 Animals are less affected by large differences between their internal rhythms and the local solar day than are humans 
 Because an animal s internal clock does not operate on a 24 hour cycle  environmental stimuli are needed to keep the biological day aligned with the solar day 

 
Methods of Studying Infant Perception
In the study of perceptual abilities of infants  a number of techniques are used to determine infants  responses to various stimuli  Because they cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires  indirect techniques of naturalistic observation are used as the primary means of determining what infants can see  hear  feel  and so forth  Each of these methods compares an infant s state prior to the introduction of a stimulus with its state during or immediately following the stimulus  The difference between the two measures provides the researcher with an indication of the level and duration of the response to the stimulus  For example  if a uniformly moving pattern of some sort is passed across the visual field of a neonate  newborn   repetitive following movements of the eye occur  The occurrence of these eye movements provides evidence that the moving pattern is perceived at some level by the newborn  Similarly  changes in the infant s general level of motor activity  turning the head  blinking the eyes  crying  and so forth  have been used by researchers as visual indicators of the infant s perceptual abilities 
Such techniques  however  have limitations  First  the observation may be unreliable in that two or more observers may not agree that the particular response occurred  or to what degree it occurred  Second  responses are difficult to quantify  Often the rapid and diffuse movements of the infant make it difficult to get an accurate record of the number of responses  The third  and most potent  limitation is that it is not possible to be certain that the infant s response was due to the stimulus presented or to a change from no stimulus to a stimulus  The infant may be responding to aspects of the stimulus different than those identified by the investigator  Therefore  when observational assessment is used as a technique for studying infant perceptual abilities  care must be taken not to overgeneralize from the data or to rely on one or two studies as conclusive evidence of a particular perceptual ability of the infant 
Observational assessment techniques have become much more sophisticated  reducing the limitations just presented  Film analysis of the infant s responses  heart and respiration rate monitors  and nonnutritive sucking devices are used as effective tools in understanding infant perception  Film analysis permits researchers to carefully study the infant s responses over and over and in slow motion  Precise measurements can be made of the length and frequency of the infant s attention between two stimuli  Heart and respiration monitors provide the investigator with the number of heartbeats or breaths taken when a new stimulus is presented  Numerical increases are used as quantifiable indicators of heightened interest in the new stimulus  Increases in nonnutritive sucking were first used as an assessment measure by researchers in 1969  They devised an apparatus that connected a baby s pacifier to a counting device  As stimuli were presented  changes in the infant s sucking behavior were recorded  Increases in the number of sucks were used as an indicator of the infant s attention to or preference for a given visual display 
Two additional techniques of studying infant perception have come into vogue  The first is the habituation dishabituation technique  in which a single stimulus is presented repeatedly to the infant until there is a measurable decline  habituation  in whatever attending behavior is being observed  At that point a new stimulus is presented  and any recovery  dishabituation  in responsiveness is recorded  If the infant fails to dishabituate and continues to show habituation with the new stimulus  it is assumed that the baby is unable to perceive the new stimulus as different  The habituation dishabituation paradigm has been used most extensively with studies of auditory and olfactory perception in infants  The second technique relies on evoked potentials  which are electrical brain responses that may be related to a particular stimulus because of where they originate  Changes in the electrical pattern of the brain indicate that the stimulus is getting through to the infant s central nervous system and eliciting some form of response 
Each of the preceding techniques provides the researcher with evidence that the infant can detect or discriminate between stimuli  With these sophisticated observational assessment and electro physiological measures  we know that the neonate of only a few days is far more perceptive than previously suspected  However  these measures are only  indirect  indicators of the infant s perceptual abilities 



1  Paragraph 1 indicates that researchers use indirect methods primarily to observe the 
 range of motor activity in neonates
 frequency and duration of various stimuli
 change in an infant s state following the introduction of a stimulus
 range of an infant s visual field
	
2  The word uniformly in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 clearly
 quickly
 consistently
 occasionally

3  Why does the author mention repetitive following movements of the eye 
 To identify a response that indicates a neonate s perception of a stimulus
 To explain why a neonate is capable of responding to stimuli only through repetitive movements
 To argue that motor activity in a neonate may be random and unrelated to stimuli
 To emphasize that responses to stimuli vary in infants according to age
















4  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a problem in using the technique of direct observation 
 It is impossible to be certain of the actual cause of an infant s response 
 Infants  responses  which occur quickly and diffusely  are often difficult to measure 
 Infants do not respond well to stimuli presented in an unnatural laboratory setting 
 It may be difficult for observers to agree on the presence or the degree of a response 

5  The word potent in the passage is closest in meaning to
 artificial
 powerful
 common
 similar

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 Researchers using observational assessment techniques on infants must not overgeneralize and must base their conclusions on data from many studies 
 On the basis of the data from one or two studies  it seems that some infants develop a particular perceptual ability not observed in others 
 To use data from one or two studies on infant s perceptual abilities  it is necessary to use techniques that will provide conclusive evidence 
 When researchers fail to make generalizations from their studies  their observed data is often inconclusive 




















7  What is the author s primary purpose in paragraph 3  
 To explain why researchers must conduct more than one type of study when they are attempting to understand infant perception
 To describe new techniques for observing infant perception that overcome problems identified in the previous paragraph
 To present and evaluate the conclusions of various studies on infant perception
 To point out the strengths and weaknesses of three new methods for quantifying an infant s reaction to stimuli


8  The word quantifiable in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 visual
 permanent
 meaningful
 measurable


9  Paragraph 3 mentions all of the following as indications of an infant s heightened interest in a new stimulus EXCEPT an increase in 
 sucking behavior
 heart rate
 the number of breaths taken
 eye movements








10  According to paragraph 4  which of the following leads to the conclusion that infants are able to differentiate between stimuli in a habituation dishabituation study 
 Dishabituation occurs with the introduction of a new stimulus 
 Electrical responses in the infant s brain decline with each new stimulus 
 Habituation is continued with the introduction of a new stimulus 
 The infant displays little change in electrical brain responses 

11  In paragraph 4  what does the author suggest about the way an infant s brain perceives stimuli  
 An infant s potential to respond to a stimulus may be related to the size of its brain 
 Changes in the electrical patterns of an infant s brain are difficult to detect 
 Different areas of an infant s brain respond to different types of stimuli 
 An infant is unable to perceive more than one stimulus at a time 


12  Paragraph 5 indicates that researchers who used the techniques described in the passage discovered that 
 infants find it difficult to perceive some types of stimuli
 neonates of only a few days cannot yet discriminate between stimuli
 observational assessment is less useful for studying infant perception than researchers previously believed
 a neonate is able to perceive stimuli better than researchers once thought








13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage 
The repetition allows researchers to observe the infant s behavior until they reach agreement about the presence and the degree of the infant s response

Researchers use a number of techniques to determine how infants respond to changes in their environment
 
 
 

Answer choices

 Data from observational methods must be confirmed through multiple studies 
 New techniques for studying infant perception have improved the accuracy with which researchers observe and quantify infant responses
 Indirect observation is most accurate when researchers use it to test auditory and olfactory perception in neonates 
 Visual indicators such as turning the head  blinking the eyes  or crying remain the best evidence of an infant s perceptual abilities 
 Pacifiers are commonly used in studies to calm an infant who has been presented with excessive stimuli 
 Sophisticated techniques that have aided new discoveries about perception in the neonate continue to be indirect measures

Children and Advertising



Young children are trusting of commercial advertisements in the media  and advertisers have sometimes been accused of taking advantage of this trusting outlook  The Independent Television Commission  regulator of television advertising in the United Kingdom  has criticized advertisers for  misleadingness  creating a wrong impression either intentionally or unintentionally in an effort to control advertisers  use of techniques that make it difficult for children to judge the true size  action  performance  or construction of a toy 


General concern about misleading tactics that advertisers employ is centered on the use of exaggeration  Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely ill equipped to recognize such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information  Claims such as  the best  or  better than  can be subjective and misleading  even adults may be unsure as to their meaning  They represent the advertiser s opinions about the qualities of their products or brand and  as a consequence  are difficult to verify  Advertisers sometimes offset or counterbalance an exaggerated claim with a disclaimer a qualification or condition on the claim  For example  the claim that breakfast cereal has a health benefit may be accompanied by the disclaimer  when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast   However  research has shown that children often have difficulty understanding disclaimers  children may interpret the phrase  when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast  to mean that the cereal is required as a necessary part of a balanced breakfast  The author George Comstock suggested that less than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old understood standard disclaimers used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are more readily comprehended when presented in both audio and visual formats  Nevertheless  disclaimers are mainly presented in audio format only 


Fantasy is one of the more common techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young audience  Child oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic and fantasy than advertisements aimed at adults  In a content analysis of Canadian television  the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play  Children have strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life  but children may not be adept enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal  Fantasy situations and settings are frequently used to attract children s attention  particularly in food advertising  Advertisements for breakfast cereals have  for many years  been found to be especially fond of fantasy techniques  with almost nine out of ten including such content  Generally  there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can distinguish between fantasy and reality in advertising  Certainly  rational appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited  as most advertisements use emotional and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations 






The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is common in advertising  The intention is for the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the audience s mind  In children s advertising  the  celebrities  are often animated figures from popular cartoons  In the recent past  the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the concept of host selling  Host selling involves blending advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other  Host selling occurs  for example  when a children s show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal  The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling reduced children s ability to distinguish between advertising and program material  It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in host selling advertisements 


Regarding the appearance of celebrities in advertisements that do not involve host selling  the evidence is mixed  Researcher Charles Atkin found that children believe that the characters used to advertise breakfast cereals are knowledgeable about cereals  and children accept such characters as credible sources of nutritional information  This finding was even more marked for heavy viewers of television  In addition  children feel validated in their choice of a product when a celebrity endorses that product  A study of children in Hong Kong  however  found that the presence of celebrities in advertisements could negatively affect the children s perceptions of a product if the children did not like the celebrity in question 






1  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as being a difficult judgment for children to make about advertised toys  
 How big the toys are
 How much the toys cost
 What the toys can do
 How the toys are made













    2  The word  verify  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 establish the truth of
 approve of 
 understand 
 criticize

3  In paragraph 2  what is one reason that claims such as  the best  or  better than  can be misleading 
 They represent the opinions of adults  which are often different from those of children 
 They generally involve comparisons among only a small group of products 
 They reflect the attitudes of consumer protection groups rather than those of actual consumers 
 They reflect the advertiser s viewpoint about the product 

4  Cereal advertisements that include the statement  when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast  are trying to suggest that 
 the cereal is a desirable part of a healthful  balanced breakfast
 the cereal contains equal amounts of all nutrients
 cereal is a healthier breakfast than other foods are
 the cereal is the most nutritious part of the breakfast meal

  5  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are true of disclaimers made in advertisements EXCEPT   They are qualifications or conditions put on a claim 
 They may be used to balance exaggerations 
 They are usually presented in both audio and visual formats 
 They are often difficult for children to understand 












6  The word  adept  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 responsible
 skillful
 patient
 curious


7  Paragraph 3 indicates that there is uncertainty about which of the following issues involving children and fantasy in advertising 
 Whether children can tell if what they are seeing in an advertisement is real or fantasy
 Whether children can differentiate fantasy techniques from other techniques used in advertising
 Whether children realize how commonly fantasy techniques are used in advertising aimed at them
 Whether children are attracted to advertisements that lack fantasy 

8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Rational appeals in advertising are certainly limited by children s emotional immaturity and the indirect nature of their associations 
 Indirect appeals to children s psychological states or associations can limit the effectiveness of rational appeals in advertising 
 Rational appeals play a much smaller role in advertisements for children than emotional appeals and psychological associations do 
 Rational appeals in advertising aimed at children should certainly be limited until the children are emotionally and psychologically ready 












9  The word  attributes  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 evaluations
 attitudes
 actions
 characteristics

10  In paragraph 4  why does the author mention a show about a cartoon lion in which an advertisement appears featuring the same lion character 
 To help explain what is meant by the term  host selling  and why it can be misleading to children
 To explain why the role of celebrities in advertising aimed at children has often been confused with host selling
 To compare the effectiveness of using animated figures with the effectiveness of using celebrities in advertisements aimed at children
 To indicate how Kunkel first became interested in studying the effects of host selling on children


11  The word  credible  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  helpful
 believable
 valuable
 familiar

12  According to paragraph 5  what did a study of children in Hong Kong show about the use of celebrities in advertisements aimed at children 
 It is most effective with children who watch a lot of television 
 It has little effect if the celebrities are not familiar to most children 
 It is more effective in marketing cereals and food products than in marketing other kinds of products 
 It can have a negative effect if the celebrities are not popular with children 



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage 
Another aspect of advertising that may especially influence children is fantasy 
Where would the sentence best fit 

14   Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points  

Advertisers sometimes use strategies that can mislead children 
 
 
 
Answer Choices
 Advertisements can be misleading to children when the advertisements use audio and visual formats that are especially appealing to children 
 Children may not be able to interpret exaggerated claims made by advertisers or understand the disclaimers used to offset claims 
 Although the use of celebrities is not necessarily effective in advertisements aimed at children  there is evidence that host selling can positively affect their views of a product 
 Studies show that misleading tactics are used most often in commercials for breakfast cereals  with toy commercials using such tactics only slightly less frequently 
 The use of fantasy is especially common in advertisements for children  but children may not be able to distinguish fantasy from reality 
 Very young children are particularly influenced by host selling  while slightly older children are more readily misled by seemingly rational claims such as  the best  







 
Maya Water Problems

To understand the ancient Mayan people who lived in the area that is today southern Mexico and Central America and the ecological difficulties they faced  one must first consider their environment  which we think of as  jungle  or  tropical rainforest   This view is inaccurate  and the reason proves to be important  Properly speaking  tropical rainforests grow in high rainfall equatorial areas that remain wet or humid all year round  But the Maya homeland lies more than sixteen hundred kilometers from the equator  at latitudes 17 to 22 degrees north  in a habitat termed a  seasonal tropical forest   That is  while there does tend to be a rainy season from May to October  there is also a dry season from January through April  If one focuses on the wet months  one calls the Maya homeland a  seasonal tropical forest   if one focuses on the dry months  one could instead describe it as a  seasonal desert  

From north to south in the Yucatan Peninsula  where the Maya lived  rainfall ranges from 18 to 100 inches  457 to 2 540 millimeters  per year  and the soils become thicker  so that the southern peninsula was agriculturally more productive and supported denser populations  But rainfall in the Maya homeland is unpredictably variable between years  some recent years have had three or four times more rain than other years  As a result  modern farmers attempting to grow corn in the ancient Maya homelands have faced frequent crop failures  especially in the north  The ancient Maya were presumably more experienced and did better  but nevertheless they too must have faced risks of crop failures from droughts and hurricanes 

Although southern Maya areas received more rainfall than northern areas  problems of water were paradoxically more severe in the wet south  While that made things hard for ancient Maya living in the south  it has also made things hard for modern archaeologists who have difficulty understanding why ancient droughts caused bigger problems in the wet south than in the dry north  The likely explanation is that an area of underground freshwater underlies the Yucatan Peninsula  but surface elevation increases from north to south  so that as one moves south the land surface lies increasingly higher above the water table  In the northern peninsula the elevation is sufficiently low that the ancient Maya were able to reach the water table at deep sinkholes called cenotes  or at deep caves  In low elevation north coastal areas without sinkholes  the Maya would have been able to get down to the water table by digging wells up to 75 feet  22 meters  deep  But much of the south lies too high above the water table for cenotes or wells to reach down to it  Making matters worse  most of the Yucatan Peninsula consists of karst  a porous sponge like limestone terrain where rain runs straight into the ground and where little or no surface water remains available 

How did those dense southern Maya populations deal with the resulting water problem  It initially surprises us that many of their cities were not built next to the rivers but instead on high terrain in rolling uplands  The explanation is that the Maya excavated depressions  or modified natural depressions  and then plugged up leaks in the karst by plastering the bottoms of the depressions in order to create reservoirs  which collected rain from large plastered catchment basins and stored it for use in the dry season  For example  reservoirs at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet the drinking water needs of about 10 000 people for a period of 18 months  At the city of Coba the Maya built dikes around a lake in order to raise its level and make their water supply more reliable  But the inhabitants of Tikal and other cities dependent on reservoirs for drinking water would still have been in deep trouble if 18 months passed without rain in a prolonged drought  A shorter drought in which they exhausted their stored food supplies might already have gotten them in deep trouble  because growing crops required rain rather than reservoirs 




1  Why does the author call the Mayan homeland both a  seasonal tropical forest  and  seasonal desert  
 To illustrate how the climate of the Mayan homeland varied from region to region
 To explain how the climate of the Mayan homeland is similar to that of a jungle or tropical rainforest
 To emphasize the vast size of the area that comprised the Mayan homeland in ancient times
 To make the point that the Mayan homeland is climatically more complex than is generally assumed



2  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 2 as a difference between the northern and southern Yucatan Peninsula  
 The annual rainfall was greater in the south 
 The population density was lower in the north

Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia

Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which economic activity is based primarily on livestock  Archaeological evidence suggests that by 3000 B C   and perhaps even earlier  there had emerged on the steppes of Inner Eurasia the distinctive types of pastoralism that were to dominate the region s history for several millennia  Here  the horse was already becoming the animal of prestige in many regions  though sheep  goats  and cattle could also play a vital role  It is the use of horses for transportation and warfare that explains why Inner Eurasian pastoralism proved the most mobile and the most militaristic of all major forms of pastoralism  The emergence and spread of pastoralism had a profound impact on the history of Inner Eurasia  and also  indirectly  on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area  In particular  pastoralism favors a mobile lifestyle  and this mobility helps to explain the impact of pastoralist societies on this part of the world 

The mobility of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal based foods  While agriculturalists rely on domesticated plants  pastoralists rely on domesticated animals  As a result  pastoralists  like carnivores in general  occupy a higher position on the food chain  All else being equal  this means they must exploit larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to secure the same amount of food  clothing  and other necessities  So pastoralism is a more extensive lifeway than farming is  However  the larger the terrain used to support a group  the harder it is to exploit that terrain while remaining in one place  So  basic ecological principles imply a strong tendency within pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism  a mobile lifestyle   As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it   The greater the degree of pastoralism  the stronger the tendency toward nomadism   A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented   The more animals you have  the farther you have to move  

Nomadism has further consequences  It means that pastoralist societies occupy and can influence very large territories  This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the Inner Eurasian steppes  for this was the most mobile of all major forms of pastoralism  So  it is no accident that with the appearance of pastoralist societies there appear large areas that share similar cultural  ecological  and even linguistic features  By the late fourth millennium B C   there is already evidence of large culture zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia  Perhaps the most striking sign of mobility is the fact that by the third millennium B C   most pastoralists in this huge region spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo European languages  The remarkable mobility and range of pastoral societies explain  in part  why so many linguists have argued that the Indo European languages began their astonishing expansionist career not among farmers in Anatolia  present day Turkey   but among early pastoralists from Inner Eurasia  Such theories imply that the Indo European languages evolved not in Neolithic  10 000 to 3 000 B C   Anatolia  but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers  which took up stock breeding and began to exploit the neighboring steppes 

Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability  If you are constantly on the move  you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses  Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households  though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry   So  by and large  nomadism implies a high degree of self sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor  Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist  and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies  but except in periods of military conquest  they are normally too slight to generate the stable  hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class  Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies  but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities  and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men  including  often  their military skills

 interest
 status

2  According to paragraph 1  what made it possible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism to become the most mobile and militaristic form of pastoralism 
 It involved the domestication of several types of animals 
 It was based primarily on horses rather than on other animals 
 It borrowed and improved upon European ideas for mobility and warfare 
 It could be adapted to a wide variety of environments  
3  The word  profound  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 strange
 positive
 direct
 far reaching

4  In paragraph 2  why does the author contrast pastoralists with agriculturalists 
 To explain why pastoralism requires more land than agriculturalism to support basic needs
 To identify some advantages that mobile societies have over immobile societies
 To demonstrate that ecological principles that apply to pastoralism do not apply to agriculturalism
 To argue that agriculturalism eventually developed out of pastoralism 

5  According to paragraph 2  pastoralists tend to
 prefer grazing their animals on agricultural lands
 consume comparatively large amounts of food and clothing 
 avoid eating plant foods
 move from place to place frequently

6  In paragraph 3  why does the author discuss languages spoken in the region spanning from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia 
 To emphasize the frequency with which Indo European languages changed as a result of the mobile nature of pastoralism
 To indicate one method linguists use to determine that inhabitants of the Don and Dnieper river area had taken up stock breeding
 To provide evidence that Indo European languages have their roots in what is now Turkey
 To provide evidence that pastoralist societies can exercise cultural influence over a large area

 reliable
 noticeable
 convincing
 violent

8  The word  exploit  in the passage is closest in meaning to

9  According to paragraph 4  the fact that pastoralist communities are subject to  strict rules of portability  encourages such communities to
 relocate less frequently than they would otherwise
 have households that are more or less equal in wealth
 become self sufficient in the manufacture of silk and jewelry 
 share large material surpluses with neighboring communities 


10  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are true of social inequality in pastoralist societies EXCEPT  
 It exists and has existed to some degree in most pastoral societies  
 It is most marked during periods of military conquest 
 It is expressed in the form of a rigid hierarchy based largely on heredity 
 It is usually too insignificant to be discussed in terms of class differences 


11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Despite the fact that wealth is relatively evenly distributed in pastoral societies  gender inequality still exists because only men can acquire military skills and social status 
 Inequalities of gender existed in pastoralist societies until most communities began to require women to possess the same skills as men and take part in the military 
 Inequalities of gender in pastoralist societies were caused by steep hierarchies of wealth and differences in military training between men and women 
 In pastoral societies  gender inequality is comparatively mild because wealth is relatively evenly distributed and women have to learn most of the same skills that men do

Answer Choices

 The domesticated horse is primarily responsible for Inner Eurasian pastoralism s success in mobility and warfare 
 As pastoralists traveled across large areas of terrain with their domesticated animals  they traded valuable material goods such as silks and jewelry 
 Because pastoralists are highly mobile  they tend to have few material possessions and can influence the culture  ecology  and language of very large areas 
 Because pastoralism requires a great deal of land to support its animal based lifeway  pastoralists must continually relocate and have comparatively egalitarian societies 
 Most scholars now believe that Indo European languages probably evolved during the Neolithic period in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers 
 Pastoralist communities do not have social classes in the usual sense because they value spiritual attainment over material wealth 








 
TPO 15
A Warm Blooded Turtle
When it comes to physiology  the leatherback turtle is  in some ways  more like a reptilian whale than a turtle  It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea turtle  and it deals with the chilly waters in a way unique among reptiles 
A warm blooded turtle may seem to be a contradiction in terms  Nonetheless  an adult leatherback can maintain a body temperature of between 25 and 26°C  77 79°F  in seawater that is only 8°C  46 4°F   Accomplishing this feat requires adaptations both to generate heat in the turtle s body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters  Leatherbacks apparently do not generate internal heat the way we do  or the way birds do  as a by product of cellular metabolism  A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface  its dark  almost black body color may help it to absorb solar radiation  However  most of its internal heat comes from the action of its muscles 
Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways  The first  and simplest  is size  The bigger the animal is  the lower its surface to volume ratio  for every ounce of body mass  there is proportionately less surface through which heat can escape  An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will therefore take longer to cool off  Maintaining a high body temperature through sheer bulk is called gigantothermy  It works for elephants  for whales  and  perhaps  it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs  It apparently works  in a smaller way  for some other sea turtles  Large loggerhead and green turtles can maintain their body temperature at a degree or two above that of the surrounding water  and gigantothermy is probably the way they do it  Muscular activity helps  too  and an actively swimming green turtle may be 7°C  12 6°F  warmer than the waters it swims through 
Gigantothermy  though  would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters  It is not enough for whales  which supplement it with a thick layer of insulating blubber  fat   Leatherbacks do not have blubber  but they do have a reptilian equivalent  thick  oil saturated skin  with a layer of fibrous  fatty tissue just beneath it  Insulation protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers  Because the flippers are comparatively thin and blade like  they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become chilled  There is not much that the turtle can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic shape of the flipper  The problem is that as blood flows through the turtle s flippers  it risks losing enough heat to lower the animal s central body temperature when it returns  The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle s body  The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the base of its flipper into a countercurrent exchange system 
In a countercurrent exchange system  the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels  thus  the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper itself  This is the same arrangement found in an old fashioned steam radiator  in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water courses through them  The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement  gulls have a countercurrent exchange in their legs  That is why a gull can stand on an ice floe without freezing 
All this applies  of course  only to an adult leatherback  Hatchlings are simply too small to conserve body heat  even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems  We do not know how old  or how large  a leatherback has to be before it can switch from a cold blooded to a warm blooded mode of life  Leatherbacks reach their immense size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow  Perhaps their rush to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm

7  According to paragraph 4  which of the following features enables the leatherback turtle to stay warm 
 An insulating layer of blubber
 A thick  oily skin covering fatty tissue
 The aerodynamic shape of its flippers
 A well insulated head

























8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 In a turtle s countercurrent exchange system  outgoing vessels lie near enough to ingoing ones that heat can be exchanged from the former to the latter before reaching the turtle s flippers 
 Within the turtle s flippers  there is a countercurrent exchange system that allows colder blood vessels to absorb heat from nearby warmer blood vessels and then return warmed blood to the turtle s body 
 In a countercurrent exchange system  a turtle can pick up body heat from being close enough to other turtles  thus raising its blood temperature as it passes them 
 When a turtle places its flippers close to its body  it is able to use its countercurrent exchange system to transfer heat from the warmer blood vessels in its body to the cooler blood vessels in its flippers 

9  Why does the author mention old fashioned steam radiator in the discussion of countercurrent exchange systems 
 To argue that a turtle s central heating system is not as highly evolved as that of other warmblooded animals
 To provide a useful comparison with which to illustrate how a countercurrent exchange system works
 To suggest that steam radiators were modeled after the sophisticated heating system of turtles
 To establish the importance of the movement of water in countercurrent exchange systems

Contrary to what we would expect of reptiles  the leatherback turtle is actually warm blooded 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Even though they swim into cold ocean waters  leatherbacks maintain their body heat in much the same way as sea turtles in warm southern oceans do 
 The leatherback turtle uses a countercurrent exchange system in order to keep the flippers from drawing heat away from the rest of the body 
 The shape of the leatherback turtle s flippers is especially important in maintaining heat in extremely cold northern waters 
 The leatherback turtle is able to maintain body heat through sheer size 
 Leatherbacks have an insulating layer that can be considered the reptilian version of blubber 
 Young leatherbacks often do not survive to adulthood because they are not able to switch from a cold blooded way of life to a warm blooded one quickly enough 









Mass Extinctions
Cases in which many species become extinct within a geologically short interval of time are called mass extinctions  There was one such event at the end of the Cretaceous period  around 70 million years ago   There was another  even larger  mass extinction at the end of the Permian period  around 250 million years ago   The Permian event has attracted much less attention than other mass extinctions because mostly unfamiliar species perished at that time 
The fossil record shows at least five mass extinctions in which many families of marine organisms died out  The rates of extinction happening today are as great as the rates during these mass extinctions  Many scientists have therefore concluded that a sixth great mass extinction is currently in progress 
What could cause such high rates of extinction  There are several hypotheses  including warming or cooling of Earth  changes in seasonal fluctuations or ocean currents  and changing positions of the continents  Biological hypotheses include ecological changes brought about by the evolution of cooperation between insects and flowering plants or of bottom feeding predators in the oceans  Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very brief period during which all extinctions suddenly took place  other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more gradually  over an extended period  or at different times on different continents  Some hypotheses fail to account for simultaneous extinctions on land and in the seas  Each mass extinction may have had a different cause  Evidence points to hunting by humans and habitat destruction as the likely causes for the current mass extinction 
American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski  who have studied extinction rates in a number of fossil groups  suggest that episodes of increased extinction have recurred periodically  approximately every 26 million years since the mid Cretaceous period  The late Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more drastic in a whole series of such recurrent extinction episodes  The possibility that mass extinctions may recur periodically has given rise to such hypotheses as that of a companion star with a long period orbit deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits  making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing widespread devastation upon impact 
Of the various hypotheses attempting to account for the late Cretaceous extinctions  the one that has attracted the most attention in recent years is the asteroid impact hypothesis first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez  According to this hypothesis  Earth collided with an asteroid with an estimated diameter of 10 kilometers  or with several asteroids  the combined mass of which was comparable  The force of collision spewed large amounts of debris into the atmosphere  darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled  The reduced level of photosynthesis led to a massive decline in plant life of all kinds  and this caused massive starvation first of herbivores and subsequently of carnivores  The mass extinction would have occurred very suddenly under this hypothesis 
One interesting test of the Alvarez hypothesis is based on the presence of the rare earth element iridium  Ir   Earth s crust contains very little of this element  but most asteroids contain a lot more  Debris thrown into the atmosphere by an asteroid collision would presumably contain large amounts of iridium  and atmospheric currents would carry this material all over the globe  A search of sedimentary deposits that span the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods shows that there is a dramatic increase in the abundance of iridium briefly and precisely at this boundary  This iridium anomaly offers strong support for the Alvarez hypothesis even though no asteroid itself has ever been recovered 
An asteroid of this size would be expected to leave an immense crater  even if the asteroid itself was disintegrated by the impact  The intense heat of the impact would produce heat shocked quartz in many types of rock  Also  large blocks thrown aside by the impact would form secondary craters surrounding the main crater  To date  several such secondary craters have been found along Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula  and heat shocked quartz has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti  A location called Chicxulub  along the Yucatan coast  has been suggested as the primary impact site 

1  Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about mass extinctions 
 They take place over a period of 70 million years 
 They began during the Cretaceous period 
 They eliminate many animal species that exist at the time they occur 
 They occur every 250 million years 
2  According to paragraph 2  scientists base their belief that a mass extinction is going on at present on which of the following 
 The speed with which mass extinctions are happening today is similar to the speed of past extinctions 
 The number of species that have died out since the last extinction event is extremely large 
 Mass extinctions occur with regularity and it is time for another one 
 Fossil records of many marine species have disappeared 
3  The word extended in the passage is closest in meaning to
 specific
 unlimited 
 reasonable
 long
4  According to paragraph 3  each of the following has been proposed as a possible cause of mass extinctions EXCEPT
 habitat destruction
 continental movement

 changes in Earth s temperature
5  Paragraph 3 supports which of the following ideas about mass extinctions 
 Scientists know the exact causes of most mass extinctions 
 Mass extinctions are unlikely to happen again in the future 
 Insects  flowering plants  and bottom feeding predators in the oceans tend to be the first organisms to disappear during episodes of mass extinctions 
 Some mass extinctions occurred on land and in the seas at the same time

There have been many attempts to explain the causes of mass extinctions 
 
 
 
Answer Choices

 Asteroid impacts  evolutionary developments  and changes in Earth s climate and in the positions of the continents have all been proposed as possible causes of mass extinctions 
 Researchers have observed 26 million year cycles in extinction rates of a number of fossil groups that could all be attributed to the same cause 
 According to the Alvarez hypothesis  much of the iridium originally present on Earth was thrown into the atmosphere as a result of an asteroid impact that also caused a mass extinction 
 The unusual distribution of iridium on Earth and the presence of craters and heat shocked quartz are central to the theory that an asteroid impact caused the late Cretaceous event 
 The collision between Earth and a large asteroid resulted in massive damage and generated enough heat to cause irreversible changes in Earth s atmosphere 
 There was a particularly large mass extinction that occurred around 250 million years ago at the end of the Permian period  whose cause could not be determined 









 
Glacier Formation

Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where more snowfalls during a year than melts  Snow falls as hexagonal crystals  but once on the ground  snow is soon transformed into a compacted mass of smaller  rounded grains  As the air space around them is lessened by compaction and melting  the grains become denser  With further melting  refreezing  and increased weight from newer snowfall above  the snow reaches a granular recrystallized stage intermediate between flakes and ice known as firn  With additional time  pressure  and refrozen meltwater from above  the small firn granules become larger  interlocked crystals of blue glacial ice  When the ice is thick enough  usually over 30 meters  the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become plastic and to flow outward or downward from the area of snow accumulation 

Glaciers are open systems  with snow as the system s input and meltwater as the system s main output  The glacial system is governed by two basic climatic variables  precipitation and temperature  For a glacier to grow or maintain its mass  there must be sufficient snowfall to match or exceed the annual loss through melting  evaporation  and calving  which occurs when the glacier loses solid chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes  If summer temperatures are high for too long  then all the snowfall from the previous winter will melt  Surplus snowfall is essential for a glacier to develop  A surplus allows snow to accumulate and for the pressure of snow accumulated over the years to transform buried snow into glacial ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow  Glaciers are sometimes classified by temperature as faster flowing temperate glaciers or as slower flowing polar glaciers 

Glaciers are part of Earth s hydrologic cycle and are second only to the oceans in the total amount of water contained  About 2 percent of Earth s water is currently frozen as ice  Two percent may be a deceiving figure  however  since over 80 percent of the world s freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers  with the majority of it in Antarctica  The total amount of ice is even more awesome if we estimate the water released upon the hypothetical melting of the world s glaciers  Sea level would rise about 60 meters  This would change the geography of the planet considerably  In contrast  should another ice age occur  sea level would drop drastically  During the last ice age  sea level dropped about 120 meters 

When snowfalls on high mountains or in Polar Regions  it may become part of the glacial system  Unlike rain  which returns rapidly to the sea or atmosphere  the snow that becomes part of a glacier is involved in a much more slowly cycling system  Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the liquid water system as meltwater  In the meantime  however  this ice is not static  Glaciers move slowly across the land with tremendous energy  carving into even the hardest rock formations and thereby reshaping the landscape as they engulf  push  drag  and finally deposit rock debris in places far from its original location  As a result  glaciers create a great variety of landforms that remain long after the surface is released from its icy covering 

Throughout most of Earth s history  glaciers did not exist  but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth s land surface is covered by glaciers  Present day glaciers are found in Antarctica  in Greenland  and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia  In the recent past  from about 2 4 million to about 10 000 years ago  nearly a third of Earth s land area was periodically covered by ice thousands of meters thick  In the much more distant past  other ice ages have occurred

Glaciers are part of Earth s hydrologic cycle 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Glaciers  which at present contain 80 percent of Earth s freshwater  form when accumulated snow is compressed and recrystallized into ice over a period of years 
 When there are glaciers on Earth  water is cycled through the glacier system  but the cycle period may be hundreds of thousands of years during periods of ice ages 
 The glacial system is governed by precipitation and temperature in such a way that glaciers cannot form in temperate latitudes 
 When glacial ice reaches a depth of 30 meters  the weight of the ice causes ice crystals at the bottom to flow  and the resulting movement of the glacier carves the landscape 
 If global warming melted the world s glaciers  sea level would rise about 60 meters worldwide 
 Glaciers have had little effect on Earth s surface because only 2 percent of Earth s water is currently contained in glaciers  and there are fewer glaciers now than at most times in the past

Trade and the Ancient Middle East
Trade was the mainstay of the urban economy in the Middle East  as caravans negotiated the surrounding desert  restricted only by access to water and by mountain ranges  This has been so since ancient times  partly due to the geology of the area  which is mostly limestone and sandstone  with few deposits of metallic ore and other useful materials Ancient demands for obsidian  a black volcanic rock useful for making mirrors and tools  led to trade with Armenia to the north  while jade for cutting tools was brought from Turkistan  and the precious stone lapis lazuli was imported from Afghanistan  One can trace such expeditions back to ancient Sumeria  the earliest known Middle Eastern civilization  Records show merchant caravans and trading posts set up by the Sumerians in the surrounding mountains and deserts of Persia and Arabia  where they traded grain for raw materials  such as timber and stones  as well as for metals and gems 
Reliance on trade had several important consequences  Production was generally in the hands of skilled individual artisans doing piecework under the tutelage of a master who was also the shop owner  In these shops differences of rank were blurred as artisans and masters labored side by side in the same modest establishment  were usually members of the same guild and religious sect  lived in the same neighborhoods  and often had assumed  or real  kinship relationships  The worker was bound to the master by a mutual contract that either one could repudiate  and the relationship was conceptualized as one of partnership 
This mode of craft production favored the growth of self governing and ideologically egalitarian craft guilds everywhere in the Middle Eastern city  These were essentially professional associations that provided for the mutual aid and protection of their members  and allowed for the maintenance of professional standards  The growth of independent guilds was furthered by the fact that surplus was not a result of domestic craft production but resulted primarily from international trading  the government left working people to govern themselves  much as shepherds of tribal confederacies were left alone by their leaders  In the multiplicity of small scale local egalitarian or quasi egalitarian organizations for fellowship  worship  and production that flourished in this laissez faire environment  individuals could interact with one another within a community of harmony and ideological equality  following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves by shared consensus while minimizing distinctions of wealth and power 
The mercantile economy was also characterized by a peculiar moral stance that is typical of people who live by trade an attitude that is individualistic  calculating  risk taking  and adaptive to circumstances  As among tribespeople  personal relationships and a careful weighing of character have always been crucial in a mercantile economy with little regulation  where one s word is one s bond and where informal ties of trust cement together an international trade network  Nor have merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance for aristocratic professions of moral superiority  favoring instead an egalitarian ethic of the open market  where steady hard work  the loyalty of one s fellows  and   entrepreneurial skill make all the difference  And  like the pastoralists  Middle Eastern merchants and artisans unhappy with their environment could simply pack up and leave for greener pastures an act of self assertion wholly impossible in most other civilizations throughout history 
Dependence on long distance trade also meant that the great empires of the Middle East were built both literally and figuratively on shifting sand  The central state  though often very rich and very populous  was intrinsically fragile  since the development of new international trade routes could undermine the monetary base and erode state power  as occurred when European seafarers circumvented Middle Eastern merchants after Vasco da Gama s voyage around Africa in the late fifteenth century opened up a southern route  The ecology of the region also permitted armed predators to prowl the surrounding barrens  which were almost impossible for a state to control  Peripheral peoples therefore had a great advantage in their dealings with the center  making government authority insecure and anxious 


    1  According to paragraph 1  why has trade been so important throughout the history of the Middle East 
 The rare and valuable metals and stones found in Middle Eastern deserts have always been in high demand in surrounding areas 
 Growing conditions throughout the Middle East are generally poor  forcing Middle Eastern people to depend on imported grain 
 Many useful and decorative raw materials cannot be found naturally in the Middle East but are available from neighboring regions 
 Frequent travel  due to limited water supplies in the Middle East  created many opportunities for trade with neighboring societies 



    2  The word  repudiate  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 respect
 reject
 review 	
 revise

    3  According to paragraph 2  how did Middle Eastern shop owners treat their workers 
 Workers were ranked according to their skill level  with the most experienced artisans becoming partial owners of the shop 
 Shop owners treated different workers differently depending on how much the workers had in common with their masters 
 Workers were bound to their masters by unbreakable contracts that strictly defined the terms of their partnership 
 The shop owner worked alongside the workers and often considered them partner and members of the family 











4  The author includes the information that surplus was not a result of domestic craft production but resulted primarily from international trading in order to
 support the claim that the mode of production made possible by the craft guilds w very good for trade
 contrast the economic base of the city government with that of the tribal confederacies
 provide a reason why the government allowed the guilds to be self controlled
 suggest that the government was missing out on a valuable opportunity to tax the guilds


5  According to paragraph 3  all of the following are true of the Middle Eastern craft guilds EXCEPT  
 The guilds were created to support workers and to uphold principles of high quality craft production 
 Each guild was very large and included members from a broad geographic area 
 The leaders of the guilds were chosen by popular vote 
 All guild members were treated as equals 


6  The word  consensus  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 authority
 responsibility
 custom
 agreement














7  According to paragraph 4  which of the following was NOT necessary for success in the mercantile economy

8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Tribes people were comfortable forming personal relationships with merchants  who  like them  were bound by their promises to one another 
 Because trade was not formally regulated  merchants were careful about whom they trusted and often conducted business with people they knew personally 
 While trade among merchants relied somewhat on regulation  among tribes people trade was based on personal relationships and careful character evaluation 
 Because tribes people were bound only by their promises to one another  personal relationships were formed only after careful weighing of character 

9  The word  ethic  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 set of moral principles
 division of labor
 economic system 
 test of character

10  According to paragraph 4  what choice did Middle Eastern merchants and artisans have that many other people have not had 
 If they were unhappy in the mercantile environment  they could draw on personal connections to find a different kind of work 
 They were allowed to assert their opinions without having to listen to aristocratic professions of moral superiority 
 Following the example of the pastoralists  they could demand  and receive  better working conditions 
 If they didn t like their environment  they could move somewhere else 







11  The word  intrinsically  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 fundamentally 
 surprisingly 
 consequently

12  In paragraph 5  why does the author mention the new trade route opened up by Vasco da Gama s fifteenth century voyage around Africa 
 To provide evidence that European seafarers took every opportunity to bypass Middle Eastern merchants
 To present an instance in which Middle Eastern states lost money and power because of their reliance on long distance trade
 To argue this new route became necessary when European seafarers wanted to avoid Middle Eastern states whose central power had begun to erode
 To explain how da Gama helped European traders avoid the dangerous predators prowling the areas surrounding Middle Eastern cities

Since ancient times  reliance on trade has shaped the culture and organizational structure of Middle Eastern societies 
 
 
 

Answer Choices
  Persian and Arabian merchants traveled great distances to sell their finished goods at the marketplaces of   ancient Sumeria 
  Revenue from trade was unevenly distributed  causing Middle Eastern societies to be characterized by growing distinctions in wealth and power 
  Qualities that were valued in the mercantile economy included individualism  hard work  loyalty  and the willingness to take risks 
  As production increased  centralized control over production also increased  leading in turn to more centralized control over fellowship and worship 
  Crafts were produced by skilled artisans working in close  egalitarian relationships with their masters and other fellow guild members 
 The stability of Middle Eastern governments was threatened by their lack of control over international trade patterns and over their own peripheral territories 






























 
Development of the Periodic Table
The periodic table is a chart that reflects the periodic recurrence of chemical and physical properties of the elements when the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number  the number of protons in the nucleus   It is a monumental scientific achievement  and its development illustrates the essential interplay between observation  prediction  and testing required for scientific progress  In the 1800 s scientists were searching for new elements  By the late 1860 s more than 60 chemical elements had been identified  and much was known about their descriptive chemistry  Various proposals were put forth to arrange the elements into groups based on similarities in chemical and physical properties  The next step was to recognize a connection between group properties  physical or chemical similarities  and atomic mass  the measured mass of an individual atom of an element   When the elements known at the time were ordered by increasing atomic mass  it was found that successive elements belonged to different chemical groups and that the order of the groups in this sequence was fixed and repeated itself at regular intervals  Thus when the series of elements was written so as to begin a new horizontal row with each alkali metal  elements of the same groups were automatically assembled in vertical columns in a periodic table of the elements  This table was the forerunner of the modern table 
When the German chemist Lothar Meyer and  independently  the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev first introduced the periodic table in 1869 70  one third of the naturally occurring chemical elements had not yet been discovered  Yet both chemists were sufficiently farsighted to leave gaps where their analyses of periodic physical and chemical properties indicated that new elements should be located  Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer and even assumed that if a measured atomic mass put an element in the wrong place in the table  the atomic mass was wrong  In some cases this was true  Indium  for example  had previously been assigned an atomic mass between those of arsenic and selenium  Because there is no space in the periodic table between these two elements  Mendeleyev suggested that the atomic mass of indium be changed to a completely different value  where it would fill an empty space between cadmium and tin  In fact  subsequent work has shown that in a periodic table  elements should not be ordered strictly by atomic mass  For example  tellurium comes before iodine in the periodic table  even though its atomic mass is slightly greater  Such anomalies are due to the relative abundance of the  isotopes  or varieties of each element  All the isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons  but differ in their number of neutrons  and hence in their atomic mass  The isotopes of a given element have the same chemical properties but slightly different physical properties  We now know that atomic number  the number of protons in the nucleus   not atomic mass number  the number of protons and neutrons   determines chemical behavior 
Mendeleyev went further than Meyer in another respect  he predicted the properties of six elements yet to be discovered  For example  a gap just below aluminum suggested a new element would be found with properties analogous to those of aluminum  Mendeleyev designated this element  eka aluminum   eka is the Sanskrit word for  next   and predicted its properties  Just five years later an element with the proper atomic mass was isolated and named gallium by its discoverer  The close correspondence between the observed properties of gallium and Mendeleyev s predictions for eka aluminum lent strong support to the periodic law  Additional support came in 1885 when eka silicon  which had also been described in advance by Mendeleyev  was discovered and named germanium 
The structure of the periodic table appeared to limit the number of possible elements  It was therefore quite surprising when John William Strut  Lord Rayleigh  discovered a gaseous element in 1894 that did not fit into the previous classification scheme  A century earlier  Henry Cavendish had noted the existence of a residual gas when   oxygen and nitrogen are removed from air  but its importance had not been realized  Together with William Ramsay  Rayleigh isolated the gas  separating it from other substances into its pure state  and named it argon  Ramsay then studied a gas that was present in natural gas deposits and discovered that it was helium  an element whose presence in the Sun had been noted earlier in the spectrum of sunlight but that had not previously been known on Earth  Rayleigh and Ramsay postulated the existence of a new group of elements  and in 1898 other members of the series  neon  krypton  and xenon  were isolated

2  According to paragraph 1  what pattern did scientists notice when the known elements were written in order of increasing atomic mass  
 The elements of the group of alkali metals were the first elements in the order of increasing atomic mass 
 Repetition of the same atomic masses for elements in different groups appeared 
 Elements with similar chemical properties appeared in the listing at regular intervals 
 Elements were chemically most similar to those just before and after them in the order 











     3  In paragraph 2  what is the author s purpose in presenting the information about the decision by Meyer and Mendeleyev to leave gaps in the periodic table 
 To illustrate their confidence that the organizing principles of the periodic table would govern the occurrence of all chemical elements
 To indicate that some of their analyses of periodic physical and chemical properties were later found to be wrong
 To support the idea that they were unwilling to place new elements in the periodic table
 To indicate how they handled their disagreement about where to place new elements
4  What reason does the author provide for the claim that Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer 
 Mendeleyev corrected incorrect information Meyer had proposed 
 Mendeleyev assumed that some information believed to be true about the elements was incorrect 
 Mendeleyev argued that Meyer had not left enough gaps in the periodic table 
 Mendeleyev realized that elements were not ordered by atomic mass in the periodic table 
5  According to paragraph 2  why did Mendeleyev suggest changing the atomic mass of indium  
 Because indium did not fit into the periodic table in the place predicted by its atomic mass 
 Because there was experimental evidence that the atomic mass that had been assigned to indium was incorrect 
 Because there was an empty space between cadmium and tin in the periodic table 
 Because the chemical properties of indium were similar to those of arsenic and selenium 
6  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that tellurium comes before iodine in the periodic table even though tellurium s atomic mass is slightly greater because
 iodine is less common than tellurium
 both iodine and tellurium have no isotopes
 the chemical behavior of tellurium is highly variable
 the atomic number of tellurium is smaller than that of iodine

 Mendeleyev s prediction that eka silicon would be discovered next 
 The organizing principle of the periodic table 
 The idea that unknown elements existed

Planets in Our Solar System
The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets  their satellites  and numerous small bodies  including asteroids  comets  and meteoroids  An estimated 99 85 percent of the mass of our solar system is contained within the Sun  while the planets collectively make up most of the remaining 0 15 percent  The planets  in order of their distance from the Sun  are Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and Pluto  Under the control of the Sun s gravitational force  each planet maintains an elliptical orbit and all of them travel in the same direction 

The planets in our solar system fall into two groups  the terrestrial  Earth like  planets  Mercury  Venus  Earth  and Mars  and the Jovian  Jupiter like  planets  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  and Neptune   Pluto is not included in either category  because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this planet s true nature a mystery 

The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size  The largest terrestrial planet  Earth has a diameter only one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet  Neptune  and its mass is only one seventeenth as great  Hence  the Jovian planets are often called giants  Also  because of their relative locations  the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets  while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets  There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes 

Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition  The densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5 times the density of water  whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1 5 times the density of water  One of the outer planets  Saturn  has a density of only 0 7 that of water  which means that Saturn would float in water  Variations in the composition of the planets are largely responsible for the density differences  The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups gases  rocks  and ices based on their melting points  The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks  dense rocky and metallic material  with minor amounts of gases  The Jovian planets  on the other hand  contain a large percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium  with varying amounts of ices  mostly water  ammonia  and methane ices 

The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen  helium  methane  and ammonia  By comparison  the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best  A planet s ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass  Simply stated  a gas molecule can  evaporate  from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity  For Earth  this velocity is 11 kilometers per second  Any material  including a rocket  must reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go into space  The Jovian planets  because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities  have higher escape velocities  21 60 kilometers per second  than the terrestrial planets  Consequently  it is more difficult for gases to  evaporate  from them  Also  because the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature  at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape  On the other hand  a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity  like Earth s moon  is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere  The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth  Venus  and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide  but even their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small portion of their total mass 

The orderly nature of our solar system leads most astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at essentially the same time and from the same material as the Sun  It is hypothesized that the primordial cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter  However  unlike Jupiter  the terrestrial planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices  The explanation may be that the   terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies  relative closeness to the Sun  which meant that their temperatures were relatively high 


1  According to the passage  each of the following statements comparing terrestrial planets with Jovian planets is true EXCEPT  
 Terrestrial planets are closer to the Sun than Jovian planets  
 Terrestrial planets have smaller diameters than Jovian planets 
 Terrestrial planets have smaller masses than Jovian planets

 It is less dense than any of the terrestrial planets 
 It contains no rocky material 
 It contains ices  
 It contains a large percentage of gases

6  According to paragraph 5  which of the following statements is true of both Jovian and terrestrial planets  
  The thicker the atmosphere  the smaller the planet s mass 
  The more varied the gases in the atmosphere  the higher the temperature
  The higher the surface gravity  the higher the escape velocity
  The less the atmosphere contributes to the total mass  the lower the temperature

7  According to paragraph 5  what is a major reason that Jovian planets have much thicker atmospheres than terrestrial planets do 
  Jovian planets have lower surface gravities
 Jovian planets have lower temperatures
 Jovian planets have lower escape velocities
 Jovian planets  gas molecules have higher average speeds

 More massive planets are less able to retain gases than less massive ones  
 Planets are more likely to retain heavy gases than light gases 
 Jovian planets are unlikely to retain the lightest gases 
 Only terrestrial planets have been able to retain carbon dioxide  











9  In calling the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun and all the planets are thought to have condensed  primordial   the author means that the cloud was 
 immense in size
 composed of similar particles
 present at the very beginning of our solar system s formation 
 created from a great variety of different materials

Europe s Early Sea Trade with Asia

In the fourteenth century  a number of political developments cut Europe s overland trade routes to southern and eastern Asia  with which Europe had had important and highly profitable commercial ties since the twelfth century  This development  coming as it did when the bottom had fallen out of the European economy  provided an impetus to a long held desire to secure direct relations with the East by establishing a sea trade  Widely reported  if somewhat distrusted  accounts by figures like the famous traveler from Venice  Marco Polo  of the willingness of people in China to trade with Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be gained by such contact made the idea irresistible  Possibilities for trade seemed promising  but no hope existed for maintaining the traditional routes over land a new way had to be found 

The chief problem was technological  How were the Europeans to reach the East  Europe s maritime tradition had developed in the context of easily navigable seas the Mediterranean  the Baltic  and  to a lesser extent  the North Sea between England and the Continent not of vast oceans  New types of ships were needed  new methods of finding one s way  new techniques for financing so vast a scheme  The sheer scale of the investment it took to begin commercial expansion at sea reflects the immensity of the profits that such East West trade could create Spices were the most sought after commodities  Spices not only dramatically improved the taste of the European diet but also were used to manufacture perfumes and certain medicines  But even high priced commodities like spices had to be transported in large bulk in order to justify the expense and trouble of sailing around the African continent all the way to India and China 

The principal seagoing ship used throughout the Middle Ages was the galley  a long  low ship fitted with sails but driven primarily by oars  The largest galleys had as many as 50 oarsmen  Since they had relatively shallow hulls  they were unstable when driven by sail or when on rough water  hence they were unsuitable for the voyage to the East  Even if they hugged the African coastline  they had little chance of surviving a crossing of the Indian Ocean  Shortly after 1400  shipbuilders began developing a new type of vessel properly designed to operate in rough  open water  the caravel  It had a wider and deeper hull than the galley and hence could carry more cargo  increased stability made it possible to add multiple masts and sails  In the largest caravels  two main masts held large square sails that provided the bulk of the thrust driving the ship forward  while a smaller forward mast held a triangular shaped sail  called a lateen sail  which could be moved into a variety of positions to maneuver the ship 

The astrolabe had long been the primary instrument for navigation  having been introduced in the eleventh century  It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars  by calculating the angles created by these points  it determined the degree of latitude at which one stood  The problem of determining longitude  though  was not solved until the eighteenth century   By the early thirteenth century  Western Europeans had also developed and put into use the magnetic compass  which helped when clouds obliterated both the Sun and the stars  Also beginning in the thirteenth century  there were new maps refined by precise calculations and the reports of sailors that made it possible to trace one s path with reasonable accuracy  Certain institutional and practical norms had become established as well    

A maritime code known as the Consulate of the Sea  which originated in the western Mediterranean region in the fourteenth century  won acceptance by a majority of sea goers as the normative code for maritime conduct  it defined such matters as the authority of a ship s officers  protocols of command  pay structures  the rights of sailors  and the rules of engagement when ships met one another on the sea lanes  Thus by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward adventure

2  According to paragraph 1 why was it necessary to find a new way for European merchants to reach the East 
 People in China were finally ready to trade with Europeans
 The European economy was failing because there was no trade with the East
 Traditional ways of trading with the East had become very costly
 Commercial routes over land had become blocked because of political events


















3  According to paragraph 2  what was the main difficulty Europeans had to overcome in order to develop a new way of trading with the East  
 Europeans were unwilling to invest in large scale commercial ventures 
 Europeans lacked the means for navigating long distances across oceans 
 Europeans were unwilling to experiment with new business techniques 
 Europeans lacked knowledge about the commercial methods of other peoples 

4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 The high cost to investors of developing trade by sea between East and West indicates the great size of the profits that such trade could produce 
 The profits that could be created by sea trade between East and West were immense compared with the investment required to develop such trade 
 The increase in commercial activity by using sea routes reflects the importance trade between East and West had for investors seeking great profits 
 Because people made large investments in sea commerce between East and West  They expected to make immense profits 

5  The word dramatically in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Artificially
 Greatly
 Immediately

6  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that spices from Asia were desirable in Europe in the Middle Ages because they 
 were easily transported in large quantities
 could not be produced in European countries
 could be traded for products such as perfumes and medicines
 were expected to increase in value over time













7  According to paragraph 3  all of the following statements comparing the caravel with the galley are true EXCEPT 
 The caravel had fewer masts than the galley 
 The caravel had a wider hull than the galley  
 The caravel could carry more cargo than the galley 
 The caravel was more stable in rough water than the galley 



8  According to paragraph 3  what did the lateen sail contribute to the caravel as a sailing ship 
 It provided stability for the front part of the ship 
 It made it possible for the hull to be wider and deeper 
 It added considerably to the speed of the wind driven ship 
 It improved the capacity of the ship to be guided 













9  Why does the author include the information that Western Europeans had developed and put into use the magnetic compass 
 To provide an example of an instrument that was developed after caravels had begun traveling across oceans

Because land routes to Asia had been cut off in the fourteenth century  Europeans had to find a new way to trade with Asia 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Reports by travelers indicated that people in Asia were interested in renewing trade with Europeans 
 For trade in Asian goods such as spices to be profitable  these items needed to be transported in large quantities by sea 
 European galleys were able to bring Asian goods across with these items needed to be transported in large quantities by Indian Ocean and around the African coastline 
 Wind driven caravels were developed to carry cargo across the oceans 
 The development of maps  navigational instruments  and a maritime code of conduct provided crucial elements for long distance navigation 
 Europeans wanted to import spices from Asia in order to improve the taste of food and to make perfumes and medicines 









 
Animal Signals in the Rain Forest

The daytime quality of light in forests varies with the density of the vegetation  the angle of the Sun  and the amount of cloud in the sky  Both animals and plants have different appearances in these various lighting conditions  A color or pattern that is relatively indistinct in one kind of light may be quite conspicuous in another 

In the varied and constantly changing light environment of the forest  an animal must be able to send visual signals to members of its own species and at the same time avoid being detected by predators  An animal can hide from predators by choosing the light environment in which its pattern is least visible  This may require moving to different parts of the forest at different times of the day or under different weather conditions  or it may be achieved by changing color according to the changing light conditions  Many species of amphibians  frogs and toads  and reptiles  lizards and snakes  are able to change their color patterns to camouflage themselves  Some also signal by changing color  The chameleon lizard has the most striking ability to do this  Some chameleon species can change from a rather dull appearance to a full riot of carnival colors in seconds  By this means  they signal their level of aggression or readiness to mate 

Other species take into account the changing conditions of light by performing their visual displays only when the light is favorable  A male bird of paradise may put himself in the limelight by displaying his spectacular plumage in the best stage setting to attract a female  Certain butterflies move into spots of sunlight that have penetrated to the forest floor and display by opening and closing their beautifully patterned wings in the bright spotlights  They also compete with each other for the best spot of sunlight 

Very little light filters through the canopy of leaves and branches in a rain forest to reach ground level or close to the ground and at those levels the yellow to green wavelengths predominate  A signal might be most easily seen if it is maximally bright  In the green to yellow lighting conditions of the lowest levels of the forest  yellow and green would be the brightest colors  but when an animal is signaling  these colors would not be very visible if the animal was sitting in an area with a yellowish or greenish background  The best signal depends not only on its brightness but also on how well it contrasts with the background against which it must be seen  In this part of the rain forest  therefore  red and orange are the best colors for signaling  and they are the colors used in signals by the ground walking Australian brush turkey  This species  which lives in the rain forests and scrublands of the east coast of Australia  has a brown to black plumage with bare  bright red skin on the head and neck and a neck collar of orange yellow loosely hanging skin  During courtship and aggressive displays  the turkey enlarges its colored neck collar by inflating sacs in the neck region and then flings about a pendulous part of the colored signaling apparatus as it utters calls designed to attract or repel  This impressive display is clearly visible in the light spectrum illuminating the forest floor 

Less colorful birds and animals that inhabit the rain forest tend to rely on other forms of signaling other than the visual  particularly over long distances  The piercing cries of the rhinoceros hornbill characterize the Southeast Asian rain forest  as do the unmistakable calls of the gibbons  In densely wooded environments  sound is the best means of communication over distance because in comparison with light  it travels with little impediment from trees and other vegetation  In forests  visual signals can be seen only at short distances  where they are not obstructed by trees  The   male riflebird exploits both of these modes of signaling simultaneously in his courtship display  The sounds made as each wing is opened carry extremely well over distance and advertise his presence widely  The ritualized visual display communicates in close quarters when a female has approached 


1  The phrase conspicuous in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 Common 
 Noticeable
 Different
 Colorful
2  According to paragraph 2  what is problematic about an animal s sending visual signals to members of its own species  
 Signs that make an animal visible to its species also make it visible to predators 
 An animal that changes color to avoid predators can confuse members of its species 
 Changing light may require an animal to move beyond the visual range of other members 
 The animal may mistakenly signal aggression when it meant to signal readiness to mate 
3  The word signal in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 change
 imitate
 communicate
 hide
4  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are reasons amphibians and reptiles change color EXCEPT 
 changing seasons
 to signal others of their species 
 to match the light
 to hide from predators


5  According to paragraph 3  butterflies move into spots of sunlight in order to 
 warm their wings in order to open them
 compete with each other
 take advantage of favorable light conditions on the forest floor
 imitate birds of paradise
6  According to paragraph 4  what is true about light that reaches ground level 
 It reveals only the yellow and green colors animals use to signal each other 
 It reflects the yellow and green colors to make the floor as bright as sunshine 
 It camouflages animals whose natural colors are yellow and green 
 It consists mostly of yellow to green wavelengths 

7  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 When an animal is signaling in an area with green to yellow lighting condition  Its signal will not be visible if the background is brightly lit 
 In the lowest levels of the forest  an animal s signals are not easily seen unless there is a yellowish or greenish background 
 In the green to yellow lighting conditions at the lowest levels of the forest  only signals that are themselves green or yellow will be bright enough to be seen in most areas 
 Although green and yellow would be the brightest colors near the forest floor  these colors would make poor signals whenever the forest background was also in the green to yellow range 

8  The word inflating in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 Coloring
 Enlarging
 Loosening
 Heating

9  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about yellow and green colors compared with red and orange colors at the bottom of the forest 
 Yellow and green are better colors for signaling than red and orange colors 
 Orange and red are brighter colors than yellow and green 
 Yellow and green are likely to be more common in the background than red and orange 
 Orange and red colors do not contrast as well with the forest floor as yellow and green do 




10  What can be inferred from paragraph 5 about the less colorful birds and animals that inhabit the forest 
 These species are less able to see color  and therefore they communicate with one another using nonvisual signals 
 These species generally live in less densely wooded environments than more colorful birds and animals do  
 The cries of these species do not carry as well over distances as the cries of more colorful birds and animals
 These species depend more on nonvisual signals for communication because they are less visible in their environment

In the rain forest  an animal must be able to send signals to members of its own species and at the same time avoid being detected by predators 
 
 
 








Answer Choices

 Animals that have different predators at different times of day change color to avoid being detected 
 To escape notice  an animal may move or change color so that its color pattern is not visible 
 To be noticed  an animal may draw attention to the contrast F between its colors and the colors of its environment 
 Yellow and green are the most common colors found in the r rain forest 
 Animals must have signals for aggression as well as to indicate readiness to mate 
 An animal may use sound rather than color to attract attention  because sound signals are not hindered by light conditions 














Symbiotic Relationships
A symbiotic relationship is an interaction between two or more species in which one species lives in or on another species  There are three main types of symbiotic relationships  parasitism  commensalism  and mutualism  The first and the third can be key factors in the structure of a biological community  that is  all the populations of organisms living together and potentially interacting in a particular area 
Parasitism is a kind of predator prey relationship in which one organism  the parasite  derives its food at the expense of its symbiotic associate  the host  Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts  An example of a parasite is a tapeworm that lives inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs nutrients from its host  Natural selection favors the parasites that are best able to find and feed on hosts  At the same time  defensive abilities of hosts are also selected for  As an example  plants make chemicals toxic to fungal and bacterial parasites  along with ones toxic to predatory animals  sometimes they are the same chemicals   In vertebrates  the immune system provides a multiple defense against internal parasites 
At times  it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural selection in host parasite relationships  For example  Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of millions of European rabbits  The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle industries  In 1950  myxoma virus  a parasite that affects rabbits  was deliberately introduced into Australia to control the rabbit population  Spread rapidly by mosquitoes  the virus devastated the rabbit population  The virus was less deadly to the offspring of surviving rabbits  however  and it caused less and less harm over the years  Apparently  genotypes  the genetic make up of an organism  in the rabbit population were selected that were better able to resist the parasite  Meanwhile  the deadliest strains of the virus perished with their hosts as natural selection favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill them  Thus  natural selection stabilized this host parasite relationship 
In contrast to parasitism  in commensalism  one partner benefits without significantly affecting the other  Few cases of absolute commensalism probably exist  because it is unlikely that one of the partners will be completely unaffected  Commensal associations sometimes involve one species  obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by another  For instance  several kinds of birds feed on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing cattle  It is difficult to imagine how this could affect the cattle  but the relationship may help or hinder them in some way not yet recognized 
The third type of symbiosis  mutualism  benefits both partners in the relationship Legume plants and their nitrogen fixing bacteria  and the interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators  are examples of mutualistic association  In the first case  the plants provide the bacteria with carbohydrates and other organic compounds  and the bacteria have enzymes that act as catalysts that eventually add nitrogen to the soil  enriching it  In the second case  pollinators  insects  birds  obtain food from the flowering plant  and the plant has its pollen distributed and seeds dispersed much more efficiently than they would be if they were carried by the wind only  Another example of mutualism would be the bull s horn acacia tree  which grows in Central and South America  The tree provides a place to live for ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex  The ants live in large  hollow thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree  The ants also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets  these are protein rich and seem to have no   function for the tree except to attract ants  The ants benefit the host tree by attacking virtually anything that touches it  They sting other insects and large herbivores  animals that eat only plants  and even clip surrounding vegetation that grows near the tree  When the ants are removed  the trees usually die  probably because herbivores damage them so much that they are unable to compete with surrounding vegetation for light and growing space 
The complex interplay of species in symbiotic relationships highlights an important point about communities  Their structure depends on a web of diverse connections among organisms 








1  Which of the following statements about commensalism can be inferred from paragraph 1  
 It excludes interactions between more than two species 
 It makes it less likely for species within a community to survive 
 Its significance to the organization of biological communities is small 
 Its role in the structure of biological populations is a disruptive one 








2  The word derives in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 Digests
 Obtains
 Controls
 Discovers


3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is true of the action of natural selection on hosts and parasites 
 Hosts benefit more from natural selection than parasites do 
 Both aggression in predators and defensive capacities in hosts are favored for species survival 
 The ability to make toxic chemicals enables a parasite to find and isolate its host 
 Larger size equips a parasite to prey on smaller host organisms 








4  The word devastated in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 Influenced
 Infected
 strengthened 
 destroyed

5  Which of the following can be concluded from the discussion in paragraph 3 about the Australian rabbit population 
 Human intervention may alter the host  the parasite  and the relationship between them 
 The risks of introducing outside organisms into a biological community are not worth the benefits 
 Humans should not interfere in host parasite relationships 
 Organisms that survive a parasitic attack do so in spite of the natural selection process 

6  According to paragraph 3  all of the following characterize the way natural selection stabilized the Australian rabbit population EXCEPT 
 The most toxic viruses died with their hosts 
 The surviving rabbits were increasingly immune to the virus 
 The decline of the mosquito population caused the spread of the virus to decline 
 Rabbits with specific genetic make ups were favored

 Substantially
 Unintentionally
 Partially



8  According to paragraph 5  the relationship between legumes and bacteria benefits the soil by 
 adding enriching carbohydrates

 The relationship between flowering plants and pollinators provides pollinators with food and flowers with efficient reproduction 
 In some cases birds obtain food from the seeds that are dispersed in the wind 
 The wind not only helps the flowers distribute their seeds but enables birds to find more food 
 Animals and insects are more effective in distributing pollen and seeds than the wind 
10  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is NOT true of the relationship between the bull s horn acacia tree and the Pseudomyrmex ants  
 Ants defend the host trees against the predatory actions of insects and animals

Symbiotic relationships involve the interaction of two or more organisms acting as partners 
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Parasitic relationships involve the interplay of aggression by the parasite and resistance and adaptation by the host 
 Mutualism ordinarily involves an interaction between two	members of the same species 
 Mutualism is unique among symbiotic relationships in that it  r benefits both partners involved in the relationship 
 Parasitic damage to Australian rabbits was never reversed because the rabbits were unable to adapt to the parasites  attacks 
 The rarity of commensal relationships stems from the difficulty of finding relationships that benefit one species without affecting the other 
 The structure of biological communities depends on the types of relationships that exist among the species within

Industrialization in the Netherlands and Scandinavia

While some European countries  such as England and Germany  began to industrialize in the eighteenth century  the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries of Denmark  Norway  and Sweden developed later  All four of these countries lagged considerably behind in the early nineteenth century  However  they industrialized rapidly in the second half of the century  especially in the last two or three decades  In view of their later start and their lack of coal undoubtedly the main reason they were not among the early industrializers it is important to understand the sources of their success 

All had small populations  At the beginning of the nineteenth century  Denmark and Norway had fewer than 1 million people  while Sweden and the Netherlands had fewer than 2 5 million inhabitants  All exhibited moderate growth rates in the course of the century  Denmark the highest and Sweden the lowest   but all more than doubled in population by 1900  Density varied greatly  The Netherlands had one of the highest population densities in Europe  whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest Denmark was in between but closer to the Netherlands 

Considering human capital as a characteristic of the population  however  all four countries were advantaged by the large percentages of their populations who could read and write  In both 1850 and 1914  the Scandinavian countries had the highest literacy rates in Europe  or in the world  and the Netherlands was well above the European average  This fact was of enormous value in helping the national economies find their niches in the evolving currents of the international economy 

Location was an important factor for all four countries  All had immediate access to the sea  and this had important implications for a significant international resource  fish  as well as for cheap transport  merchant marines  and the shipbuilding industry  Each took advantage of these opportunities in its own way  The people of the Netherlands  with a long tradition of fisheries and mercantile shipping  had difficulty in developing good harbors suitable for steamships  eventually they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam  with exceptional results for transit trade with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of overseas foodstuffs and raw materials  sugar  tobacco  chocolate  grain  and eventually oil   Denmark also had an admirable commercial history  particularly with respect to traffic through the Sound  the strait separating Denmark and Sweden   In 1857  in return for a payment of 63 million kronor from other commercial nations  Denmark abolished the Sound toll dues the fees it had collected since 1497 for the use of the Sound  This  along with other policy shifts toward free trade  resulted in a significant increase in traffic through the Sound and in the port of Copenhagen 

The political institutions of the four countries posed no significant barriers to industrialization or economic growth  The nineteenth century passed relatively peacefully for these countries  with progressive democratization taking place in all of them  They were reasonably well governed  without notable corruption or grandiose state projects  although in all of them the government gave some aid to railways  and in Sweden the state built the main lines  As small countries dependent on foreign markets  they followed a liberal trade policy in the main  though a protectionist movement   developed in Sweden  In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms took place gradually from the late eighteenth century through the first half of the nineteenth  resulting in a new class of peasant landowners with a definite market orientation 

The key factor in the success of these countries  along with high literacy  which contributed to it  was their ability to adapt to the international division of labor determined by the early industrializers and to stake out areas of specialization in international markets for which they were especially well suited  This meant a great dependence on international commerce  which had notorious fluctuations  but it also meant high returns to those factors of production that were fortunate enough to be well placed in times of prosperity  In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870  and in 1913  22 percent of a much larger national income  In the early twentieth century  Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production  butter  pork products  and eggs  It exported 80 percent of its butter  almost all to Great Britain  where it accounted for 40 percent of British butter imports 


1  Paragraph 1 supports which of the following ideas about England and Germany  
 They were completely industrialized by the start of the nineteenth century 
 They possessed plentiful supplies of coal 
 They were overtaken economically by the Netherlands and Scandinavia during the early nineteenth century 
 They succeeded for the same reasons that the Netherlands and Scandinavia did 
  2  Paragraph 2 suggests which of the following about the importance of population density in the industrialization of the Netherlands and Scandinavia 
 It was a more important factor than population size 
 It was more influential than the rate of population growth 
 It was more important in the early stages than it was later 
 It was not a significant factor  

3  According to paragraphs 2 and 3  which of the following contributed significantly to the successful economic development of the Netherlands and of Scandinavia 
 The relatively small size of their populations
 The rapid rate at which their populations were growing
 The large amount of capital they had available for investment
 The high proportion of their citizens who were educated

 generally liberal trade policies
 huge projects undertaken by the state
 relatively uncorrupt governments
 relatively little social or political disruption



 8  The word  progressive  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 rapid 
 partial

9  The author includes the information that  a protectionist movement developed in Sweden  in order to
  support the claim that the political institutions of the four countries posed no significant barriers to industrialization or economic growth 
  identify an exception to the general trend favoring liberal trade policy
  explain why Sweden industrialized less quickly than the other Scandinavian countries and Netherlands
  provide evidence that agricultural reforms take place more quickly in countries that have a liberal trade policy than in those that do not










10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 The early industrializes controlled most of the international economy  leaving these countries to stake out new areas of specialization along the margins 
 Aided by their high literacy rates these countries were able to claim key areas of specialization within established international markets  
 High literacy rates enabled these countries to take over international markets and adapt the international division of labor to suit their strengths 
 The international division of labor established by the early industrializers was suited to these countries  a key factor in their success 


11  According to paragraph 6  a major problem with depending heavily on international markets was that they 
 lacked stability
 were not well suited to agricultural products
 were largely controlled by the early industrializers
 led to slower growth of local industries 


12  According to paragraph 6  what advantage could a country gain from being heavily involved in international commerce 
 A steadily rising national income
 Greater control over market fluctuations
 High returns when things went well
 A reduced need for imports

Although the Netherlands and Scandinavia began to industrialize relatively late  they did so very successfully
 
 
 

 Although these countries all started with small  uneducated populations  industrialization led to significant population growth and higher literacy rates 
 Thanks to their ready access to the sea  these countries enjoyed advantages in mercantile shipping  fishing  and shipbuilding 
 	Because they all started with good harbors for steamships  these countries started with an important advantage in the competition for transit trade 
 	These countries were helped by the fact that their governments were relatively stable and honest and generally  supported liberal trade policies 
 These countries were successful primarily because their high literacy rates helped them fill specialized market niches 
 Because they were never fully dependent on international commerce  these countries were able to survive notorious fluctuations in international markets 


 
The mystery of yawning

According to conventional theory  yawning takes place when people are bored or sleepy and serves the function of increasing alertness by reversing  through deeper breathing  the drop in blood oxygen levels that are caused by the shallow breathing that accompanies lack of sleep or boredom  Unfortunately  the few scientific investigations of yawning have failed to find any connection between how often someone yawns and how much sleep they have had or how tired they are  About the closest any research has come to supporting the tiredness theory is to confirm that adults yawn more often on weekdays than at weekends  and that school children yawn more frequently in their first year at primary school than they do in kindergarten 

Another flaw of the tiredness theory is that yawning does not raise alertness or physiological activity  as the theory would predict  When researchers measured the heart rate  muscle tension and skin conductance of people before  during and after yawning  they did detect some changes in skin conductance following yawning  indicating a slight increase in physiological activity  However  similar changes occurred when the subjects were asked simply to open their mouths or to breathe deeply  Yawning did nothing special to their state of physiological activity  Experiments have also cast serious doubt on the belief that yawning is triggered by a drop in blood oxygen or a rise in blood carbon dioxide  Volunteers were told to think about yawning while they breathed either normal air  pure oxygen  or an air mixture with an above normal level of carbon dioxide  If the theory was correct  breathing air with extra carbon dioxide should have triggered yawning  while breathing pure oxygen should have suppressed yawning  In fact  neither condition made any difference to the frequency of yawning  which remained constant at about 24 yawns per hour  Another experiment demonstrated that physical exercise  which was sufficiently vigorous to double the rate of breathing  had no effect on the frequency of yawning  Again the implication is that yawning has little or nothing to do with oxygen 

A completely different theory holds that yawning assists in the physical development of the lungs early in life  but has no remaining biological function in adults  It has been suggested that yawning and hiccupping might serve to clear out the fetuses airways  The lungs of a fetus secrete a liquid that mixes with its mother s amniotic fluid  Babies with congenital blockages that prevent this fluid from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs  It might be that yawning helps to clear out the lungs by periodically lowering the pressure in them  According to this theory  yawning in adults is just a developmental fossil with no biological function  But  while accepting that not everything in life can be explained by Darwinian evolution  there are sound reasons for being skeptical of theories like this one  which avoid the issue of what yawning does for adults  Yawning is distracting  consumes energy and takes time  It is almost certainly doing something significant in adults as well as in fetuses  What could it be 

The empirical evidence  such as it is  suggests an altogether different function for yawning namely  that yawning prepares us for a change in activity level  Support for this theory came from a study of yawning behavior in everyday life  Volunteers wore wrist mounted devices that automatically recorded their physical activity for up to two weeks  the   volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a button on the device each time they yawned  The data showed that yawning tended to occur about 15 minutes before a period of increased behavioral activity  Yawning bore no relationship to sleep patterns  however  This accords with anecdotal evidence that people often yawn in situations where they are neither tired nor bored  but are preparing for impending mental and physical activity  Such yawning is often referred to as  incongruous  because it seems out of place  at least on the tiredness view  soldiers yawning before combat  musicians yawning before performing  and athletes yawning before competing  Their yawning seems to have nothing to do with sleepiness or boredom quite the reverse but it does precede a change in activity level 







1  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 It is the conventional theory that when people are bored or sleepy  they often experience a drop in blood oxygen levels due to their shallow breathing 
 The conventional theory is that people yawn when bored or sleepy because yawning raises blood oxygen levels  which in turn raises alertness 
 According to conventional theory  yawning is more likely to occur when people are bored or sleepy than when they are alert and breathing deeply 
 Yawning  according to the conventional theory  is caused by boredom or lack of sleep and can be avoided through deeper breathing 



2  In paragragh1  what point does the author make about the evidence for the tiredness theory of yawning  
 There is no scientific evidence linking yawning with tiredness 
 The evidence is wide ranging because it covers multiple age groups 
 The evidence is reliable because it was collected over a long period of time 
 The evidence is questionable because the yawning patterns of children and adults should be different 
















3  The word  flaw  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 fault
 aspect
 confusion
 mystery 


4  In the paragraph 2  why does the author note that there were physiological changes when subjects opened their mouths or breathed deeply  
 To present an argument in support of the tiredness theory
 To cast doubt on the reliability of the tests that measured heart rate  muscle tension and skin conductance
 To argue against the hypothesis that yawning provides a special way to improve alertness or raise physiological activity
 To support the idea that opening the mouth or breathing deeply can affect blood oxygen levels

5  The word  triggered  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 removed
 followed
 increased
 caused

6  Paragraph 2 answers all of the following questions about yawning EXCEPT 
 Does yawning increase alertness or physiological activity 
 Does thinking about yawning increase yawning over not thinking about yawning 
 Does the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air affect the rate at which people yawn 
 Does the rate of breathing affect the rate at which people yawn 













7  The word  periodically  in the passage is closest in the meaning to
 continuously
 quickly
 regularly
 carefully



8  According to the developmental theory of yawning presented in paragraph 3  what is the role of yawning 
 It caused hiccups  which aid in the development of the lungs 
 It controls the amount of pressure the lungs place on other developing organs 
 It prevents amniotic fluid from entering the lungs 
 It removes a potentially harmful fluid from the lungs 



9  Paragraph 3 supports which of the following statements about the development theory of yawning 
 The theory is attractive because it explains yawning from the perspective of Darwinian evolution 
 The theory is unsatisfactory because it cannot explain the lung deformities of infants 
 The theory is questionable because it does not explain why a useless and inconvenient behavior would continue into adulthood 
 The theory is incomplete because it does not explain all the evolutionary stages in the development of yawning 


















10  The word  empirical  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 reliable
 based on common sense
 relevant
 based on observation



11  The study of yawning behavior discussed in paragraph 4 supports which of the following conclusions 
 Yawning is associated with an expectation of increased physical activity 
 Yawning occurs more frequently when people are asked to record their yawning 
 People tend to yawn about fifteen minutes before they become tired or bored 
 	Mental or physical stress tends to make people yawn 



    12  Why does the author mention  soldiers yawning before combat  musicians yawning before performing  and athletes yawning before competing  
 To argue that just the expectation of physical activity can make some people feel tired
 To explain how the view that people yawn because they are tired accounts for yawning before stressful situations
 To support the view that yawning helps prepare a person for mental or physical exertion
 To provide anecdotal evidence that conflicts with the experience of the volunteers in the study

The tiredness theory of yawning does not seem to explain why yawning occurs 
 	
 	
 	

 Although earlier scientific studies strongly supported the tiredness theory  new evidence has cast doubt on these findings 
 Evidence has shown that yawning is almost completely unrelated to amount of oxygen in the blood and is unrelated to sleep behavior 
 Some have proposed that yawning plays a role in the development of the lungs before birth but that it serves no purpose in adults 
 Fluids in the lungs of the fetus prevent yawning from occurring  which disproves the developmental theory of yawning 
 New studies  along with anecdotal evidence  have shown that the frequency of yawning increases during extended periods of inactivity 
 There is some evidence that suggests that yawning prepares the body and mind for a change in activity level 








 
Lightning
Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an electrical discharge from a storm cloud  The electrical discharge takes place when the attractive tension between a region of negatively charged particles and a region of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly rush together  The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical tension and releases a tremendous amount of energy  which we see as lightning  The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the development of the storm cloud 
The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich like structure  Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud  but the middle region becomes negatively charged  Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms  What happens is that small  millimeter to centimeter size  pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud  When these ice pellets fall  some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud  The temperature at the center of the cloud is about  15℃or lower  At such temperatures  the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged  Then updraft wind currents carry the light  positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud  The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center  This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged  while the center becomes negatively charged  The negatively charged region is large  several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter  Below this large  cold  negatively charged region  the cloud is warmer than  15℃  and at these temperatures  collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud  
Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses  However  as the storm cloud develops  the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground  Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive  so even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning  it has received a lot of scientific attention 
Using high speed photography  scientists have determined that there are two steps to the occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground  First  a channel  or path  is formed that connects the cloud and the ground  Then a strong current of electrons follows that path from the cloud to the ground  and it is that current that illuminates the channel as the lightning we see 
The formation of the channel is initiated when electrons surge from the cloud base toward the ground  When a stream of these negatively charged electrons comes within 100 meters of the ground it is met by a stream of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground  When the negatively and positively charged streams meet  a complete channel connecting the cloud and the ground is formed  The channel is only a few centimeters in diameter  but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the channel to the ground in the visible form of a flash of lightning  The stream of positive particles that meets the surge of electrons from the cloud often arises from a tall pointed structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower  That is why the subsequent lightning that follows the completed channel often strikes a tall structure 
Once a channel has been formed  it is usually used by several lightning discharges  each of them consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud meeting a stream of positive particles along the established path  Sometimes  however  a stream of electrons following an established channel is met by a positive stream making a new path up from the ground  The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places 










	
1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following take place in the development of a flash of lightening EXCEPT 

 great tension between two oppositely charged regions
  an increase in negatively charged particles over positively charged particles
 oppositely charged particles coming together
 the release of electrical energy in the form of visible light

3  According to paragraph2  what causes ice crystal to become positively charged 
 Collisions with ice pellets
 Collisions with negatively charged ice crystals at the base of the cloud
 Becoming concentrated in the central region of the cloud
 Forming at a temperature greater than  15℃

4  The word  acquire  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 	reject
 	obtain

 5  According to paragraph2  why are positively charged ice pellets produced in the lower part of the cloud  
 Collisions between ice crystals and ice pellets increase in number in the lower part of the cloud 
 	The lower part of the cloud is smaller than the region above it 
 	More ice pellets than ice crystals reach the lower part of the cloud 
 Temperature in the lower part of the cloud are warmer than  15℃ 

 6  According to paragraph2  the middle region of a cloud becomes negatively charged due to all of the following EXCEPT
  a shift of electrical charged between ice pellets and ice crystals
 negatively charged ice pellets that remain in the middle 
 a temperature of  15℃or less
 the development of a positive charge at the base of the cloud

 7  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that part of the reason that the top of a storm cloud becomes positively charged is that
 the top of the cloud is warmer than the middle of the cloud
  the middle of the cloud is already occupied by positively charged particles
  the negatively charged ice pellets are too heavy to be carried by the updrafts that move ice crystals
 collisions between ice pellets in the top of the cloud produce mainly positively charged particles
8  The author remarks that  Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive  in order to explain why 
 this form of lightning has been investigated so much
  this form of lightning is not as common as lightning within a cloud
  scientific understanding of this form of lightning is important
  the buildup of positive charge on the ground beneath a storm cloud can have serious consequences
9  The word  illuminates  in the passage is closet in meaning to 
 opens 
 completes
 lights
 electrifies
10  According to paragraph5  which of the following is true of the stream of charged particles from the ground 
 It prevents streams of electrons from the cloud from striking the ground 
 It completes a channel that connects the storm cloud with the ground 
 It produces a stream of electrons from the cloud 
 It widens the path made by the initial stream of electrons from the cloud 
11  Which of the following claims about lightning strikes can be inferred from paragraph 5 
 During a lightning strike the diameter of the channel the electrons follow is considerably enlarged beyond a few centimeters 
 A building is unlikely to be hit by lightning unless it is at least 100 meters tall 
 A building is hit by a lightning strike because the building itself has first determined the path the lightening then takes to it 
 The light of a lightning strike first appears at the point where the streams of negative and positive particles meet 

12  The word  initiated  is closet in meaning to 
 started
 intensified
 finished
 expected

Lightning takes place when a separation of a positive and negative electrical particles that develops in a storm could suddenly collapses 

 	
 	
 	


 A storm cloud first develops a positively charged layer at the top  then a negatively charged middle layer  and finally  a positively charged layer at the bottom 
 A separation of oppositely charged particles in clouds develops from collisions of falling ice pellets with ice crystals  from updrafts  and from temperature variations 
 Lightning from cloud to ground follows a channel that forms when a stream of electrons moving down meets a stream of positive particles coming up from the ground 
 Field studies  laboratory simulations  and high speed photography have all been used to investigate the way charge separations develop in clouds 
 Lightning from a cloud to the ground is more likely to be destructive than is lightning that takes place within a cloud 
 Once a channel has been formed  it is usually used by several successive electrical discharges that illuminate  the channel as flashes of lightning

The Roman Army s Impact on Britain


In the wake of the Roman Empire s conquest of Britain in the first century A D   a large number of troops stayed in the new province  and these troops had a considerable impact on Britain with their camps  fortifications  and participation in the local economy  Assessing the impact of the army on the civilian population starts from the realization that the soldiers were always unevenly distributed across the country  Areas rapidly incorporated into the empire were not long affected by the military  Where the army remained stationed  its presence was much more influential  The imposition of a military base involved the requisition of native lands for both the fort and the territory needed to feed and exercise the soldiers  animals  The imposition of military rule also robbed local leaders of opportunities to participate in local government  so social development was stunted and the seeds of disaffection sown  This then meant that the military had to remain to suppress rebellion and organize government 


Economic exchange was clearly very important as the Roman army brought with it very substantial spending power  Locally a fort had two kinds of impact  Its large population needed food and other supplies  Some of these were certainly brought from long distances  but demands were inevitably placed on the local area  Although goods could be requisitioned  they were usually paid for  and this probably stimulated changes in the local economy  When not campaigning  soldiers needed to be occupied  otherwise they represented a potentially dangerous source of friction and disloyalty  Hence a writing tablet dated 25 April tells of 343 men at one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking  building a bathhouse  operating kilns  digging clay  and working lead  Such activities had a major effect on the local area  in particular with the construction of infrastructure such as roads  which improved access to remote areas 


Each soldier received his pay  but in regions without a developed economy there was initially little on which it could be spent  The pool of excess cash rapidly stimulated a thriving economy outside fort gates  Some of the demand for the services and goods was no doubt fulfilled by people drawn from far afield  but some local people certainly became entwined in this new economy  There was informal marriage with soldiers  who until AD 197 were not legally entitled to wed  and whole new communities grew up near the forts  These settlements acted like small towns  becoming centers for the artisan and trading populations 





The army also provided a mean of personal advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from the native peoples  as a man obtained hereditary Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an auxiliary regiment  Such units recruited on an ad hoc  as needed  basis from the area in which they were stationed  and there was evidently large scale recruitment within Britain  The total numbers were at least 12 500 men up to the reign of the emperor Hadrian  A D  117 138   with a peak around A D  80  Although a small proportion of the total population  this perhaps had a massive local impact when a large proportion of the young men were removed from an area  Newly raised regiments were normally transferred to another province from whence it was unlikely that individual recruits would ever return  Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European continent  although one is recorded in Morocco  The reverse process brought young men to Britain  where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of service  and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman character of the frontier population  By the later Roman period    frontier garrisons  groups of soldiers  were only rarely transferred  service in units became effectively hereditary  and forts were no longer populated or maintained at full strength 

This process of settling in as a community over several generations  combined with local recruitment  presumably accounts for the apparent stability of the British northern frontier in the later Roman period  It also explains why some of the forts continued in occupation long after Rome ceased to have any formal authority in Britain  at the beginning of the fifth century A D  The circumstances that had allowed natives to become Romanized also led the self sustaining military community of the frontier area to become effectively British

The Roman army s occupation of Britain influenced and changed the local population 
 
 
 
Answer Choices

 Although the presence of the army in certain areas caused resentment among the local population  it provided important services such as building infrastructure 
 	By recruiting unemployed young men for its auxiliary units  the army made it possible for them to stay in their home towns and provide financial support for their families 
 	Large quantities of cash from soldiers  pay stimulated development  but also drove up prices  making it hard for local residents to afford goods and services 
 	Though the army appropriated land and some goods  it also paid for many supplies  stimulating local economic growth 
 	The forts contributed to the quality of local crafts by bringing in artisans from distant places who brought with them new skills and techniques 
 	Roman soldiers started families with local inhabitants  and over the generations  the military community became a stable part of British society 
 
Succession  Climax  and Ecosystems
In the late nineteenth century  ecology began to grow into an independent science from its roots in natural history and plant geography  The emphasis of this new  community ecology  was on the composition and structure of communities consisting of different species  In the early twentieth century  the American ecologist Frederic Clements pointed out that a succession of plant communities would develop after a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption  heavy flood  or forest fire  An abandoned field  for instance  will be invaded successively by herbaceous plants  plants with little or no woody tissue   shrubs  and trees  eventually becoming a forest  Light loving species are always among the first invaders  while shade tolerant species appear later in the succession 
Clements and other early ecologists saw almost lawlike regularity in the order of succession  but that has not been substantiated  A general trend can be recognized  but the details are usually unpredictable  Succession is influenced by many factors  the nature of the soil  exposure to sun and wind  regularity of precipitation  chance colonizations  and many other random processes 
The final stage of a succession  called the climax by Clements and early ecologists  is likewise not predictable or of uniform composition  There is usually a good deal of turnover in species composition  even in a mature community  The nature of the climax is influenced by the same factors that influenced succession  Nevertheless  mature natural environments are usually in equilibrium  They change relatively little through time unless the environment itself changes 
For Clements  the climax was a  superorganism   an organic entity  Even some authors who accepted the climax concept rejected Clements  characterization of it as a superorganism  and it is indeed a misleading metaphor  An ant colony may be legitimately called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances  But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation  Many authors prefer the term  association  to the term  community  in order to stress the looseness of the interaction  
Even less fortunate was the extension of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants  This resulted in the  biome   a combination of coexisting flora and fauna  Though it is true that many animals are strictly associated with certain plants  it is misleading to speak of a  spruce moose biome   for example  because there is no internal cohesion to their association as in an organism  The spruce community is not substantially affected by either the presence or absence of moose  Indeed  there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose  The opposition to the Clementsian concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason  soon joined by various other ecologists  Their major point was that the distribution of a given species was controlled by the habitat requirements of that species and that therefore the vegetation types were a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species 
With  climax    biome    superorganism   and various other technical terms for the association of animals and plants at a given locality being criticized  the term  ecosystem  was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of associated organisms together with the physical factors of their environment  Eventually  the energy transforming role of such a system was emphasized  Ecosystems thus involve the circulation  transformation  and accumulation of energy and matter through the medium of living things and their activities  The ecologist is concerned primarily with the quantities of matter and energy that pass through a given ecosystem  and with the rates at   which they do so 
Although the ecosystem concept was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s  it is no longer the dominant paradigm  Gleason s arguments against climax and biome are largely valid against ecosystems as well  Furthermore  the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to analyze  even with the help of large computers  Finally  younger ecologists have found ecological problems involving behavior and life history adaptations more attractive than measuring physical constants  Nevertheless  one still speaks of the ecosystem when referring to a local association of animals and plants  usually without paying much attention to the energy aspects 



1  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is a criticism of Clements  view of succession 
 The principles of succession are more lawlike than Clements thought they are 
 More evidence is needed to establish Clements  predictions about succession 
 The details of succession are affected by random processes 
 Many of the factors that determine which plants will grow in an environment  such as the nature of the soil and the exposure to sun  do not change at all

4  The word  likewise  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 sometimes
 similarly
 apparently
 consequently



5  The word  legitimately  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 commonly
 broadly
 properly
 officially

6  According to paragraph 4  why do many authors prefer the term  association  to  community  when describing a climax plant formation 
 Because the term  association  does not suggest the presence of a tight network involving interactive communication 
  Because the term  association  indicates that the grouping is not necessarily beneficial to all members 
 Because the term  community  indicates continuing dynamic development that a climax formation does not have 
 Because the term  community  suggests an organization that has been designed for a specific purpose 
 

7  In paragraph 5  the author challenges the idea of a  biome  by noting that 
 there are usually no very strong connections among the plants and animals living in a place
 plants and animals respond in the same way to the same circumstances
 particular combinations of flora and fauna do not generally come about purely by chance
 some animals are dependent on specific kinds of plants for food

8  Why does the author make the statement   Indeed  there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose  
 To highlight a fact whose significance the ecologist Herbert Gleason had missed
 To propose the idea that a spruce forest is by itself a superorganism
 To emphasize that moose are not limited to a single kind of environment
 To criticize the idea of a spruce moose biome

9  The word  initiated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 approved 
 identified
 started
 foreseen

10  According to paragraph 5  Gleason s opposition to the Clementsian views of plant ecology was based on the claim that plant species grow in places where
 they can enter into mutually beneficial relationships with other species
 conditions suit them  regardless of whether particular other species are present
 habitats are available for a wide variety of plant and animal species
 their requirements are met  and those of most other species are not















11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
 Unlike the terms  climax    biome    and  superorganism    which refer to the particular association of plants and animals at a given location  the term  ecosystem  refers specifically to the physical factors within an environment  
 The terms  climax    biome    superorganism   and  ecosystem  all refer to the system of plants and animals in an associated environment  but some are more controversial than others  
 When the older terms of ecology became too technical  they were replaced by the more popular and more widely used term  ecosystem  
 The term  ecosystem  gradually replaced discredited terms for the combination of a physical environment and the plants and animals living together in it 


12  According to paragraph 6  what did ecologists mainly study when the ecosystem concept was the dominant paradigm 
 The physical factors present in different environments
 The typical activities of animals and the effect of those activities on plants
 The rates at which ecosystems changed from one kind to another
 The flow of energy and matter through ecosystems

The study of the combination of plant species that inhabit a particular locality became a scientific discipline toward the end of the nineteenth century 
 
  
 





Answer Choices

 Areas that are recovering from serious disturbances like volcanic eruptions and heavy floods provide special opportunities to observe the development of plant communities 
 Whether a given species will be found in a given ecosystem strongly depends on what other species it would interact with in that ecosystem 
 Computer aided studies of entire system of associated organisms together with their environment provide a solid basis for current studies of specific ecological problems 
 According to the earliest theories of ecology  the development of plant communities proceeds in lawlike fashion and results in stable climax communities 
 The idea of associations of plants and animals that function as  superorganisms  was later rejected by biologists who saw no strong evidence in support of that idea 
 The once popular idea of communities as integrated ecosystems has been largely rejected by modern ecologists  who are more interested in problems involving behavior and adaptations 












 
Discovering the Ice Ages
In the middle of the nineteenth century  Louis Agassiz  one of the first scientists to study glaciers  immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and became a professor at Harvard University  where he continued his studies in geology and other sciences  For his research  Agassiz visited many places in the northern parts of Europe and North America  from the mountains of Scandinavia and New England to the rolling hills of the American Midwest  In all these diverse regions  Agassiz saw signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation  In flat plains country  he saw moraines  accumulations of earth and loose rock that form at the edges of glaciers  that reminded him of the terminal moraines found at the end of valley glaciers in the Alps  The heterogeneous material of the drift  sand  clay  and rocks deposited there  convinced him of its glacial origin 
The areas covered by this material were so vast that the ice that deposited it must have been a continental glacier larger than Greenland or Antarctica  Eventually  Agassiz and others convinced geologists and the general public that a great continental glaciation had extended the polar ice caps far into regions that now enjoy temperate climates  For the first time  people began to talk about ice ages  It was also apparent that the glaciation occurred in the relatively recent past because the drift was soft  like freshly deposited sediment  We now know the age of the glaciation accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon 14 in logs buried in the drift  The drift of the last glaciation was deposited during one of the most recent epochs of geologic time  the Pleistocene  which lasted from 1 8 million to 10 000 years ago  Along the east coast of the United States  the southernmost advance of this ice is recorded by the enormous sand and drift deposits of the terminal moraines that form Long Island and Cape Cod 
It soon became clear that there were multiple glacial ages during the Pleistocene  with warmer interglacial intervals between them  As geologists mapped glacial deposits in the late nineteenth century  they became aware that there were several layers of drift  the lower ones corresponding to earlier ice ages  Between the older layers of glacial material were well developed soils containing fossils of warm climate plants  These soils were evidence that the glaciers retreated as the climate warmed  By the early part of the twentieth century  scientists believed that four distinct glaciations had affected North America and Europe during the Pleistocene epoch  
This idea was modified in the late twentieth century  when geologists and oceanographers examining oceanic sediment found fossil evidence of warming and cooling of the oceans  Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic record of the Pleistocene than continental glacial deposits did  The fossils buried in Pleistocene and earlier ocean sediments were of foraminifera small  single celled marine organisms that secrete shells of calcium carbonate  or calcite  These shells differ in their proportion of ordinary oxygen  oxygen 16  and the heavy oxygen isotope  oxygen 18   The ratio of oxygen 16 to oxygen 18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer s shell depends on the temperature of the water in which the organism lived  Different ratios in the shells preserved in various layers of sediment reveal the temperature changes in the oceans during the Pleistocene epoch 

Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect  They could trace the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers  even in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in temperature around the equator  for example  The oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice  During glaciations  the lighter oxygen 16 has a greater tendency to evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen 18 does  Thus  more of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms  From this analysis of marine   sediments  geologists have learned that there were many shorter  more regular cycles of glaciation and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the glacial drift of the continents alone

3  According to paragraph 1  what persuaded Louis Agassiz that glaciation in the past had been widespread 
 Geologic differences between mountain valleys and flat plains
 The presence of similar glacial material in many different regions
 Geologic research on mountain glaciers in the Alps
 Evidence of regional differences in the drift caused by glacial erosion


4  The word  enjoy  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 experience
 resemble

5  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Agassiz and other geologists of his time were not able to determine 
 which geographic regions had been covered with ice sheets in the last ice age
 the exact dates at which drifts had been deposited during the last ice age
 the exact composition of the drifts laid during the last ice age
 how far south along the east coast of the United States the ice had advanced during the last ice age 
6  According to paragraph 3  what did geologists conclude as a result of finding well developed soils containing warm climate plant fossils between layers of glacial drift 
 There had been only one warm period before the Pleistocene epoch 
 There had been multiple periods of mild weather between ice ages 
 Several glacial periods occurred after the Pleistocene epoch 
 Some earlier epochs were warmer than the Pleistocene 


7  According to paragraph 3 and 4  scientists modified their theory about the exact number of glaciations because of evidence obtained from 
  ocean sediments
 interglacial soils
 glacial deposits
 air samples

8  The word  reveal  in the passage is closest in meaning to 
 result from
 vary with

9  According to paragraph 4  scientists use foraminifera shells to learn about Pleistocene ocean conditions by 
 measuring the amount of calcium carbonate present in the shells
 determining the proportion of shell in each layer of sediment
 comparing shells deposited during the Pleistocene with those buried earlier
 calculating the relative quantity of two oxygen isotopes in the calcite



10  In can be inferred from paragraph 5 that foraminifera fossil shells containing calcite with high percentages of oxygen 16 were deposited at times when 
 polar ice extended as far as equatorial regions of land and sea
 extensive glaciation was not occurring
 there were no great increases in ocean temperature
 there was heavy snowfall on continental glaciers

11 In paragraph 5  why does the author include the information that the  oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice  
 To explain how scientists were able to calculate how frequently the continental ice sheets expanded and contracted 
 To explain how scientists have determined that there was no great change in ocean temperatures at the equator during past glaciations
 To provide evidence that oxygen 16 has a greater tendency to evaporate than does oxygen 18 
 To suggest that equatorial marine organisms absorb more heavy isotopes than do marine organisms elsewhere

12  According to the passage  when did scientists begin to realize that more than one ice age had occurred 
 In the mid nineteenth century
 In the late nineteenth century
 In the early twentieth century
 In the late twentieth century

Louis Agassiz was the first to note signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation in diverse regions of Europe and North America 
 
 
 





Answer Choices

 Evidence of a pattern of glacier like deposits eventually convinced most geologists that an enormous continental glacier had extended into the temperate zone 
 Glacial research showed that many layers of ice were deposited  with each new period of glaciation extending farther south than the one before 
 Isotopic analysis of marine sediments showed that periods of glaciation and deglaciation were more frequent  shorter  and more cyclic than previously thought 
 Nineteenth century geologists came to accept the idea that the areas covered by polar ice had reached as far as the equator  a far larger area than Agassiz had thought 
 Nineteenth century geologists studying the layers of drift concluded that during the Pleistocene epoch  several glaciations had occurred with warm periods between them 
 Research involving foraminifera fossil shells show that ocean temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere varied greatly during the most extensive periods of glaciation

Westward Migration

The story of the westward movement of population in the United States is  in the main  the story of the expansion of American agriculture of the development of new areas for the raising of livestock and the cultivation of wheat  corn  tobacco  and cotton  After 1815 improved transportation enabled more and more western farmers to escape a self sufficient way of life and enter a national market economy  During periods when commodity prices were high  the rate of westward migration increased spectacularly   Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward   observed an English visitor in 1817  during the first great wave of migration  Emigration to the West reached a peak in the 1830 s  Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains  by 1840 more than a third lived there 
Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers most of them farmers  some of them artisans drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East  Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this remarkable migration  The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some religious  political  or economic crisis uprooted them and drove them across the Atlantic  Many of those who experienced this sharp break thereafter lacked the ties that had bound them and their ancestors to a single place  Moreover  European society was relatively stratified  occupation and social status were inherited  In American society  however  the class structure was less rigid  some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to improve their social and economic position  As a result  many Americans were an inveterately restless  rootless  and ambitious people  Therefore  these social traits helped to produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement  In addition  there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes  material success  and better lives 
The West had plenty of attractions  the alluvial river bottoms  the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands  the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their rocky  sterile land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and erosion  In 1820 under a new land law  a farm could be bought for $100  The continued proliferation of banks made it easier for those without cash to negotiate loans in paper money  Western Farmers borrowed with the confident expectation that the expanding economy would keep farm prices high  thus making it easy to repay loans when they fell due 
Transportation was becoming less of a problem for those who wished to move west and for those who hand farm surpluses to send to market  Prior to 1815  western farmers who did not live on navigable waterways were connected to them only by dirt roads and mountain trails  Livestock could be driven across the mountains  but the cost of transporting bulky grains in this fashion was several times greater than their value in eastern markets  The first step toward an improvement of western transportation was the construction of turnpikes  These roads made possible a reduction in transportation costs and thus stimulated the commercialization of agriculture along   their routes 
Two other developments presaged the end of the era of turnpikes and started a transportation revolution that resulted in increased regional specialization and the growth of a national market economy  First came the steamboat  although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850 s steamboats eventually superseded all other craft in the carrying of passengers and freight  Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver freight for about one tenth of what it had previously cost on hand propelled keelboats  Next came the Erie Canal  an enormous project in its day  spanning about 350 miles  After the canal went into operation  the cost per mile of transporting a ton of freight from Buffalo to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than 1 cent  Eventually  the western states diverted much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie Canal  a shorter route to eastern markets

 They had limited their crop production to wheat  corn  tobacco  and cotton 
 They were able to sell their produce at high prices 
 They had not been successful in raising cattle 
 They did not operate in a national market economy

Early Settlements in the Southwest Asia
The universal global warming at the end of the Ice Age had dramatic effects on temperate regions of Asia  Europe  and North America  Ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose  The climatic changes in southwestern Asia were more subtle  in that they involved shifts in mountain snow lines  rainfall patterns  and vegetation cover  However  these same cycles of change had momentous impacts on the sparse human populations of the region  At the end of the Ice Age  no more than a few thousand foragers lived along the eastern Mediterranean coast  in the Jordan and Euphrates valleys  Within 2 000 years  the human population of the region numbered in the tens of thousands  all as a result of village life and farming  Thanks to new environmental and archaeological discoveries  we now know something about this remarkable change in local life 

Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and elsewhere tell us forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age  for the southwestern Asian climate was still cooler and considerably wetter than today  Many areas were richer in animal and plant species than they are now  making them highly favorable for human occupation  About 9000 B C   most human settlements lay in the area along the Mediterranean coast and in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and their foothills  Some local areas  like the Jordan River valley  the middle Euphrates valley  and some Zagros valleys  were more densely populated than elsewhere  Here more sedentary and more complex societies flourished  These people exploited the landscape intensively  foraging on hill slopes for wild cereal grasses and nuts  while hunting gazelle and other game on grassy lowlands and in river valleys  Their settlements contain exotic objects such as seashells  stone bowls  and artifacts made of obsidian  volcanic glass   all traded from afar  This considerable volume of intercommunity exchange brought a degree of social complexity in its wake 

Thanks to extremely fine grained excavation and extensive use of flotation methods  through which seeds are recovered from soil samples   we know a great deal about the foraging practices of the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria s Euphrates valley  Abu Hureyra was founded about 9500B C  a small village settlement of cramped pit dwellings  houses dug partially in the soil  with reed roofs supported by wooden uprights  For the next 1 500 years  its inhabitants enjoyed a somewhat warmer and damper climate than today  living in a well wooded steppe area where wild cereal grasses were abundant  They subsisted off spring migrations of Persian gazelles from the south  With such a favorable location  about 300 to 400 people lived in a sizable  permanent settlement  They were no longer a series of small bands but lived in a large community with more elaborate social organization  probably grouped into clans of people of common descent 

The flotation samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study shifts in plant collecting habits as if they were looking through a telescope at a changing landscape  Hundreds of tiny plant remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and oak forests  However  as the climate dried up  the forests retreated from the vicinity of the settlement  The inhabitants turned to wild cereal grasses instead  collecting them by the thousands  while the percentage of nuts in the diet fell  By 8200B C   drought conditions were so severe that the people abandoned their long established settlement  perhaps dispersing into smaller camps 

Five centuries later  about 7700B C   a new village rose on the mound  At first the inhabitants still hunted gazelle intensively  Then  about 7000 B C   within the space of a few generations  they switched abruptly to herding   domesticated goats and sheep and to growing einkorn  pulses  and other cereal grasses  Abu Hureyra grew rapidly until it covered nearly 30 acres  It was a close knit community of rectangular  one story mud brick houses  joined by narrow lanes and courtyards  finally abandoned about 5000 B C   Many complex factors led to the adoption of the new economies  not only at Abu Hureyra  but at many other locations such as  Ain Ghazal  also in Syria  where goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of abrasion caused by foot tethering  binding  testify to early herding of domestic stock

Fossil Preservation
When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death  it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are  Attack by scavengers and bacteria  chemical decay  and destruction by erosion and other geologic agencies make the odds against preservation very high  However  the chances of escaping complete destruction are vastly improved if the organism happens to have a mineralized skeleton and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by sediment  Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors  where shelled invertebrates  organisms without spines  flourish and are covered by the continuous rain of sedimentary particles  Although most fossils are found in marine sedimentary rocks  they also are found in terrestrial deposits left by streams and lakes  On occasion  animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand  trapped in ice or lava flows  or engulfed by rapid falls of volcanic ash 
The term  fossil  often implies petrifaction  literally a transformation into stone  After the death of an organism  the soft tissue is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and bacteria  The empty shell of a snail or clam may be left behind  and if it is sufficiently durable and resistant to dissolution  it may remain basically unchanged for a long period of time  Indeed  unaltered shells of marine invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old  In many marine creatures  however  the skeleton is composed of a mineral variety of calcium carbonate called aragonite  Although aragonite has the same composition as the more familiar mineral known as calcite  it has a different crystal form  is relatively unstable  and in time changes to the more stable calcite 
Many other processes may alter the shell of a clam or snail and enhance its chances for preservation  Water containing dissolved silica  calcium carbonate  or iron may circulate through the enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves  In such cases  the original composition of the bone or shell remains  but the fossil is made harder and more durable  This addition of a chemically precipitated substance into pore spaces is termed  permineralization  
Petrifaction may also involve a simultaneous exchange of the original substance of a dead plant or animal with mineral matter of a different composition  This process is termed  replacement  because solutions have dissolved the original material and replaced it with an equal volume of the new substance  Replacement can be a marvelously precise process  so that details of shell ornamentation  tree rings in wood  and delicate structures in bone are accurately preserved 
Another type of fossilization  known as carbonization  occurs when soft tissues are preserved as thin films of carbon  Leaves and tissue of soft bodied organisms such as jellyfish or worms may accumulate  become buried and compressed  and lose their volatile constituents  The carbon often remains behind as a blackened silhouette 
Although it is certainly true that the possession of hard parts enhances the prospect of preservation  organisms having soft tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved  Insects and even small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees  X ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles  digestive tracts  and visual organs of a variety of marine creatures  Soft parts  including skin  hair  and viscera of ice age mammoths  have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps 
The probability that actual remains of soft tissue will be preserved is improved if the organism dies in an environment of rapid deposition and oxygen deprivation  Under such conditions  the destructive effects of bacteria are diminished  The Middle Eocene Messel Shale  from about 48 million years ago  of Germany accumulated in such an environment  The shale was deposited in an oxygen deficient lake where lethal gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals  Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by clay and silt  Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons  hard outer coverings   frogs with skin and blood vessels intact  and even entire small mammals with preserved fur and soft tissue

Geothermal Energy

    Earth s internal heat  fueled by radioactivity  provides the energy for plate tectonics and continental drift  mountain building  and earthquakes  It can also be harnessed to drive electric generators and heat homes  Geothermal energy becomes available in a practical form when underground heat is transferred by water that is heated as it passes through a subsurface region of hot rocks  a heat reservoir  that may be hundreds or thousands of feet deep  The water is usually naturally occurring groundwater that seeps down along fractures in the rock  less typically  the water is artificially introduced by being pumped down from the surface  The water is brought to the surface  as a liquid or steam  through holes drilled for the purpose 
By far the most abundant form of geothermal energy occurs at the relatively low temperatures of 80°to 180°centigrade  Water circulated through heat reservoirs in this temperature range is able to extract enough heat to warm residential  commercial  and industrial spaces  More than 20 000 apartments in France are now heated by warm underground water drawn from a heat reservoir in a geologic structure near Paris called the Paris Basin  Iceland sits on a volcanic structure known as the Mid Atlantic Ridge  Reykjavik  the capital of Iceland  is entirely heated by geothermal energy derived from volcanic heat 
Geothermal reservoirs with temperatures above 180°centigrade are useful for generating electricity  They occur primarily in regions of recent volcanic activity as hot  dry rock  natural hot water  or natural steam  The latter two sources are limited to those few areas where surface water seeps down through underground faults or fractures to reach deep rocks heated by the recent activity of molten rock material  The world s largest supply of natural steam occurs at The Geysers  120 kilometers north of San Francisco  California  In the 1990s enough electricity to meet about half the needs of San Francisco was being generated there  This facility was then in its third decade of production and was beginning to show signs of decline  perhaps because of over development  By the late 1990s some 70 geothermal electric generating plants were in operation in California  Utah  Nevada  and Hawaii  generating enough power to supply about a million people  Eighteen countries now generate electricity using geothermal heat 
Extracting heat from very hot  dry rocks presents a more difficult problem  the rocks must be fractured to permit the circulation of water  and the water must be provided artificially  The rocks are fractured by water pumped down at very high pressures  Experiments are under way to develop technologies for exploiting this resource 
Like most other energy sources  geothermal energy presents some environmental problems  The surface of the ground can sink if hot groundwater is withdrawn without being replaced  In addition  water heated geothermally can contain salts and toxic materials dissolved from the hot rock  These waters present a disposal problem if they are not returned to the ground from which they were removed 
The contribution of geothermal energy to the world s energy future is difficult to estimate  Geothermal energy is in a sense not renewable  because in most cases the heat would be drawn out of a reservoir much more rapidly than it would be replaced by the very slow geological processes by which heat flows through solid rock into a heat reservoir  However  in many places  for example  California  Hawaii  the Philippines  Japan  Mexico  the rift valleys of Africa  the resource is potentially so large that its future will depend on the economics of production  At present  we can make efficient use of only naturally occurring hot water or steam deposits  Although the potential is enormous  it is likely that in the near future geothermal energy can make important local contributions only where the resource is close to the user and the economics are favorable  as they are in California  New Zealand  and Iceland  Geothermal energy probably will not make large scale contributions to the world energy budget until well into the twenty first century  if ever 



1  According to the processes described in paragraph 1  what is the relationship between radioactivity and the steam produced by geothermal heat 
 Geothermally heated steam is produced when water is exposed to radioactivity deep underground 
 When water is introduced into holes drilled thousands of feet in the ground  it becomes radioactive and turns to steam 
 Radioactivity heats Earth s interior rock  which in turn can heat water to the point it becomes steam 
 When a reservoir of steam in subsurface rock is produced by radioactivity  it is said to be geothermally heated

4  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is true about heat reservoirs with a temperature in the range of 80°to 180°centigrade 
 They are under international control 
 They are more common than reservoirs that have a higher temperature 
 Few of them produce enough heat to warm large industrial spaces 
 They are used to generate electricity 



5  According to paragraph 3  what is the connection between underground faults and naturally occurring steam 
 Underground faults enable the heat from molten rock material to escape upward to regions where it can heat surface water enough to produce steam 
 Underground faults are created by steam that is produced in geothermal reservoirs deep inside Earth 
 Underground faults create spaces in which natural steam is sometimes trapped 
 Underground faults allow surface water to reach deep rocks that are hot enough to turn it into steam 

6  In paragraph 3  why does the author mention that in the 1990s The Geysers was in its third decade of production 
 To provide the historical context of the geothermal production of electricity in the United States
 To imply that The Geysers was the first geothermal site to be put into production in California
 To help explain the signs of decline shown by The Geysers
 To explain why 70 new geothermal sites were put into electricity production in the late 1990s

7  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about geothermal reservoirs 
 Volcanic heat is associated only with geothermal reservoirs that have a temperature over 180°centigrade 
 More countries produce power from geothermal reservoirs than use them for heating buildings 
 Most geothermal reservoirs are suitable for producing electricity 
 A higher geothermal reservoir temperature is needed to generate electricity than is needed to heat homes 


8  According to paragraph 4  extracting heat from very hot  dry rocks is difficult in part because
 the underground rock must be fractured before heat can be removed from it
 the water above the rock is under very high pressure
 the rock breaks apart when water is pumped into it
 the water circulated through the rock must be much cooler than the rock itself

10  How is the problem that the surface may sink related to the problem that water heated geothermally may contain toxic materials 
 Both problems could be solved by returning groundwater that is removed from an underground heat reservoir back to the reservoir after heat is extracted from it 
 The problem of sinking is more difficult to solve than is the problem of toxic materials 
 Land at the surface sinks because the rock beneath the surface is weakened when salts and toxic materials are removed from it in the process of extracting geothermal energy 
 Both problems are caused by the fact that the hot groundwater in a heat reservoir dissolves the rock  which weakens the rock and makes the water toxic with salt 



11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Heat flows through solid rock very slowly  so it takes a very long time for geological processes to produce a reservoir of geothermal energy 
 Geothermal energy is not renewable because heat flows very slowly through solid rock into or out of a heat reservoir 
 The heat quickly removed from a heat reservoir is replaced so slowly by geological processes that geothermal energy is not practically speaking  renewable 
 In most cases  heat travels into a heat reservoir so slowly that it is a much quicker process to remove the heat from a reservoir than to replace it 

12  In paragraph 6  the author implies that in California  Hawaii  the Philippines  Japan  Mexico  and the rift valleys of Africa the potential size of the geothermal resource is so large that
 it might be economically worth developing these sites even though geothermal energy is not renewable
 these sites will be the first geothermal energy sites to be developed with new technology
 these sites are likely to make a large scale contribution to the world energy budget in the twenty first century
 it does not matter whether they have naturally occurring deposits of hot water or steam

Heat reservoirs in the form of hot rock far beneath Earth s surface are a potential source of usable geothermal energy 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Heat reservoirs with a temperature from 80°to 180°centigrade can be used  as in France and Iceland  to heat buildings 
 A number of countries now use geothermal reservoirs that contain water or steam above 180°centigrade to generate electricity 
 Most heat reservoirs with a temperature above 180°centigrade cannot be used for energy because they are usually too close to recent volcanic activity 
 The sinking of land above heat reservoirs and other environmental problems arise when water is pumped into a heat reservoir under high pressure 
 Experiments are under way to determine if geothermally heated waters could be used as a source of certain minerals that have been dissolved out of hot rocks deep within Earth 
 A number of issues  including how to extract heat from reservoirs that do not have a natural supply of water  will significantly limit the use of geothermal energy for the foreseeable future 

The Origins of Agriculture
 How did it come about that farming developed independently in a number of world centers  the Southeast Asian mainland  Southwest Asia  Central America  lowland and highland South America  and equatorial Africa  at more or less the same time  Agriculture developed slowly among populations that had an extensive knowledge of plants and animals  Changing from hunting and gathering to agriculture had no immediate advantages  To start with  it forced the population to abandon the nomad s life and become sedentary  to develop methods of storage and  often  systems of irrigation  While hunter gatherers always had the option of moving elsewhere when the resources were exhausted  this became more difficult with farming  Furthermore  as the archaeological record shows  the state of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their contemporary hunter gatherers 
 Traditionally  it was believed that the transition to agriculture was the result of a worldwide population crisis  It was argued that once hunter gatherers had occupied the whole world  the population started to grow everywhere and food became scarce  agriculture would have been a solution to this problem  We know  however  that contemporary hunter gatherer societies control their population in a variety of ways  The idea of a world population crisis is therefore unlikely  although population pressure might have arisen in some areas 
Climatic changes at the end of the glacial period 13 000 years ago have been proposed to account for the emergence of farming  The temperature increased dramatically in a short period of time  years rather than centuries   allowing for a growth of the hunting gathering population due to the abundance of resources  There were  however  fluctuations in the climatic conditions  with the consequences that wet conditions were followed by dry ones  so that the availability of plants and animals oscillated brusquely 
It would appear that the instability of the climatic conditions led populations that had originally been nomadic to settle down and develop a sedentary style of life  which led in turn to population growth and to the need to increase the amount of food available  Farming originated in these conditions  Later on  it became very difficult to change because of the significant expansion of these populations  It could be argued  however  that these conditions are not sufficient to explain the origins of agriculture  Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change  and yet agriculture had not been developed 
 It is archaeologist Steven Mithen s thesis  brilliantly developed in his book The Prehistory of the Mind  1996   that approximately 40 000 years ago the human mind developed cognitive fluidity  that is  the integration of the specializations of the mind  technical  natural history  geared to understanding the behavior and distribution of natural resources   social intelligence  and the linguistic capacity  Cognitive fluidity explains the appearance of art  religion  and sophisticated speech  Once humans possessed such a mind  they were able to find an imaginative solution to a situation of severe economic crisis such as the farming dilemma described earlier  Mithen proposes the existence of four mental elements to account for the emergence of farming   1  the ability to develop tools that could be used intensively to harvest and process plant resources   2  the tendency to use plants and animals as the medium to acquire social prestige and power   3  the tendency to develop  social relationships  with animals structurally similar to those developed with people specifically  the ability to think of animals as people  anthropomorphism  and of people as animals  totemism   and  4  the tendency to manipulate plants and animals 
    The fact that some societies domesticated animals and plants  discovered the use of metal tools  became literate  and developed a state should not make us forget that others developed pastoralism or horticulture  vegetable gardening  but remained illiterate and at low levels of productivity  a few entered the modern period as hunting and gathering societies  It is anthropologically important to inquire into the conditions that made some societies adopt agriculture while others remained hunter gatherers or horticulturalists  However  it should be kept in mind that many societies that knew of agriculture more or less consciously avoided it  Whether Mithen s explanation is satisfactory is open to contention  and some authors have recently emphasized the importance of other factors

5  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 The resources needed by the growing hunting and gathering population increased rapidly once temperatures rose 
 Dramatic temperature increases and the simultaneous growth of the hunting and gathering population led to the need for more resources 
 Higher temperatures led to the existence of increased resources  thus enabling the hunting and gathering population to grow 
 The dramatic temperature increase occurred during the few years when abundant resources allowed the hunting and gathering population to grow 

6  According to paragraph 3  the abundance of resources fluctuated sharply after the end of the glacial period because
 locally abundant resources were quickly exhausted by hunter gatherers
 the temperature became much higher in some areas over others
 different types of plants and animals became available as the climate changed
 the amount of rainfall varied radically from one period to the next


7  It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that it was difficult for people to change from farming back to hunting and gathering because 
 people had become more used to different types of food
 climatic conditions were no longer favorable for hunting and gathering
 populations had become too large to be supported by hunting and gathering
 the farmer s sedentary life was easier than the hunter gatherer s nomadic life

8  Why does the author state that  Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change  and yet agriculture had not been developed

It is unclear why hunter gatherers in different parts of the world independently developed agriculture at roughly the same time 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 One obstacle to the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to the sedentary lifestyle required by agriculture was that hunter gatherers had not developed storage techniques 
 It seems unlikely that agriculture emerged in response to a food shortage brought on by a worldwide population crisis that developed once the whole world was occupied 
 The origins of agriculture maybe linked to climate change at the end of the last ice age  but this does not explain why earlier climatic instability had not led to agriculture 
 The only available means of understanding the social organization and technical abilities of ancient hunter gatherer societies is the study of contemporary hunter gatherers 
 One recent theory suggests that the invention of agriculture was made possible by the integration of various mental capacities in the human mind 
 Little is known about why only some societies that adopted agriculture rapidly progressed to using metal tools  becoming literate  and developing a state 







 
Autobiographical Memory
 Think back to your childhood and try to identify your earliest memory  How old were you  Most people are not able to recount memories for experiences prior to the age of three years  a phenomenon called infantile amnesia  The question of why infantile amnesia occurs has intrigued psychologists for decades  especially in light of ample evidence that infants and young children can display impressive memory capabilities  Many find that understanding the general nature of autobiographical memory  that is  memory for events that have occurred in one s own life  can provide some important clues to this mystery  Between ages three and four  children begin to give fairly lengthy and cohesive descriptions of events in their past  What factors are responsible for this developmental turning point 
Perhaps the explanation goes back to some ideas raised by influential Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget namely  that children under age two years represent events in a qualitatively different form than older children do  According to this line of thought  the verbal abilities that blossom in the two year old allow events to be coded in a form radically different from the action based codes of the infant  Verbal abilities of one year olds are  in fact  related to their memories for events one year later  When researchers had one year olds imitate an action sequence one year after they first saw it  there was correlation between the children s verbal skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task  However  even children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering the event  thus  memories may be facilitated by but are not dependent on those verbal skills 
Another suggestion is that before children can talk about past events in their lives  they need to have a reasonable understanding of the self as a psychological entity  The development of an understanding of the self becomes evident between the first and second years of life and shows rapid elaboration in subsequent years  The realization that the physical self has continuity in time  according to this hypothesis  lays the foundation for the emergence of autobiographical memory 
    A third possibility is that children will not be able to tell their own  life story  until they understand something about the general form stories take  that is  the structure of narratives  Knowledge about narratives arises from social interactions  particularly the storytelling that children experience from parents and the attempts parents make to talk with children about past events in their lives  When parents talk with children about  what we did today  or  last week  or  last year   they guide the children s formation of a framework for talking about the past  They also provide children with reminders about the memory and relay the message that memories are valued as part of the cultural experience  It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories than Korean children do  Furthermore  other studies show that Caucasian American mother child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother child pairs  Thus  the types of social experiences children have do factor into the development of autobiographical memories 
A final suggestion is that children must begin to develop a  theory of mind  an awareness of the concept of mental states  feelings  desires  beliefs  and thoughts   their own and those of others before they can talk about their own past memories  Once children become capable of answering such questions as  What does it mean to remember   and  What does it mean to know something   improvements in memory seem to occur 
   It may be that the developments just described are intertwined with and influence one another  Talking with parents about the past may enhance the development of the self concept  for example  as well as help the child understand what it means to  remember   No doubt the ability to talk about one s past represents memory of a different level of complexity than simple recognition or recall

2  According to paragraph 1  infantile amnesia has intrigued psychologists because 
 the ability to recount memories prior to three years of age seems to be connected to intelligence in adulthood
 psychologists do not understand why some people are able to recount memories from before the age of three years  while others are not able do so
 psychologists do not understand the connection between infantile amnesia and autobiographical memory
 although psychologists have evidence that infants have memory abilities  most people cannot remember life events that happened before the age of three years

 The child is aware that he or she does not remember experiences from before the age of three years 
 The child is able to give a basic description of the nature of autobiographical memory 



4  In paragraph 2  why does the author provide the information that children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering a past event 
 To provide evidence that memories do not depend only upon verbal skills
 To challenge the idea that one year olds are too young to form memories
 To argue that the memory of one year olds depends only on action based codes
 To suggest that Piaget later revised his findings on the correlation between memory and verbal ability

7  According to paragraph 3  what is the relationship between autobiographical memory and the development of an understanding of the self 
 Autobiographical memory aids in the development of an understanding of the self 
 Children possess an understanding of the self when they can talk about past events in their lives 
 The realization that the self continues through time may aid in the onset of autobiographical memory 
 The development of autobiographical memory helps children gain an understanding of their roles in their social relationships 

8  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as ways in which parents help their children understand the structure of narratives EXCEPT 
 talking with their children about past events
 telling stories to their children
 having their children repeat stories back to them
 showing their children that they think memories are important
9  According to paragraph 4  the studies of Caucasian American and Korean children suggest which of the following 
 Autobiographical memories develop similarly across all cultures 
 Parents from different cultures tell their children different kinds of stories about the past 
 Children s pleasure in hearing stories varies from culture to culture 
 The kinds of interactions children have with their parents affect the development of autobiographical memories 


10  According to paragraph 5  what evidence is there that a  theory of mind  is a factor in the development of autobiographical memory 
 Even children who are not aware of their mental states are still able to talk about past events 
 Autobiographical memory decreases when a child s feelings and mental state are upset 
 Older children who are unable to achieve awareness of mental states lack autobiographical memory 
 Children s memory of past events grows once children can answer questions about what it means to know and remember

 Jean Piaget was the first psychologist to understand the development of autobiographical memory 
 Understanding the development of autobiographical memory will help psychologists eliminate infant amnesia
 Understanding what it means to remember is the most important factor in the development of autobiographical memory

The ability to construct autobiographical memories coherent narratives about events from one s past is probably the joint product of several social and intellectual developments 

 
 
 




Answer Choices

 Although children are capable of simple recognition and recall very early in life  they do not develop the capacity for autobiographical memory until the age of three or four years 
 Verbal skills and familiarity with narrative structures probably aid in the construction of autobiographical memories 
 Children s earliest autobiographical memories are usually about social interactions with parents 
 Research suggests that infantile amnesia occurs in some cultures but not in others and may be linked to children s social experiences 
 The development of autobiographical memory allows children to appreciate the fact that memories are an important part of their cultural experience 
 Children who have acquired a concept of the self and of various mental states are generally able to talk about their own past memories

Spartina

Spartina alterniflora  known as cordgrass  is a deciduous  perennial flowering plant native to the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast of the United States  It is the dominant native species of the lower salt marshes along these coasts  where it grows in the intertidal zone  the area covered by water some parts of the day and exposed others  
These natural salt marshes are among the most productive habitats in the marine environment  Nutrient rich water is brought to the wetlands during each high tide  making a high rate of food production possible  As the seaweed and marsh grass leaves die  bacteria break down the plant material  and insects  small shrimplike organisms  fiddler crabs  and marsh snails eat the decaying plant tissue  digest it  and excrete wastes high in nutrients  Numerous insects occupy the marsh  feeding on living or dead cordgrass tissue  and redwing blackbirds  sparrows  rodents  rabbits  and deer feed directly on the cordgrass  Each tidal cycle carries plant material into the offshore water to be used by the subtidal organisms 
Spartina is an exceedingly competitive plant  It spreads primarily by underground stems  colonies form when pieces of the root system or whole plants float into an area and take root or when seeds float into a suitable area and germinate  Spartina establishes itself on substrates ranging from sand and silt to gravel and cobble and is tolerant of salinities ranging from that of near freshwater  0 05 percent  to that of salt water  3 5 percent   Because they lack oxygen  marsh sediments are high in sulfides that are toxic to most plants  Spartina has the ability to take up sulfides and convert them to sulfate  a form of sulfur that the plant can use  this ability makes it easier for the grass to colonize marsh environments  Another adaptive advantage is Spartan s ability to use carbon dioxide more efficiently than most other plants 
These characteristics make Spartina a valuable component of the estuaries where it occurs naturally  The plant functions as a stabilizer and a sediment trap and as a nursery area for estuarine fish and shellfish  Once established  a stand of Spartina begins to trap sediment  changing the substrate elevation  and eventually the stand evolves into a high marsh system where Spartina is gradually displaced by higher elevation  brackish water species  As elevation increases  narrow  deep channels of water from throughout the marsh  Along the east coast Spartina is considered valuable for its ability to prevent erosion and marshland deterioration  it is also used for coastal restoration projects and the creation of new wetland sites 
Spartina was transported to Washington State in packing materials for oysters transplanted from the east coast in 1894  Leaving its insect predators behind  the cordgrass has been spreading slowly and steadily along Washington s tidal estuaries on the west coast  crowding out the native plants and drastically altering the landscape by trapping sediment  Spartina modifies tidal mudflats  turning them into high marshes inhospitable to the many fish and waterfowl that depend on the mudflats  It is already hampering the oyster harvest and the Dungeness crab fishery  and it interferes with the recreational use of beaches and waterfronts  Spartina has been transplanted to England and to New Zealand for land reclamation and shoreline stabilization  In New Zealand the plant has spread rapidly  changing mudflats with marshy fringes to extensive salt meadows and reducing the number and kinds of birds and animals that use the marsh 
Efforts to control Spartina outside its natural environment have included burning  flooding  shading plants with black canvas or plastic  smothering the plants with dredged materials or clay  applying herbicide  and mowing repeatedly  Little success has been reported in New Zealand and England  Washington State s management program has tried many of these methods and is presently using the herbicide glyphosphate to control its spread  Work has begun to determine the feasibility of using insects as biological controls  but effective biological controls are considered years away  Even with a massive effort  it is doubtful that complete eradication of Spartina from nonnative habitats is possible  for it has become an integral part of these shorelines and estuaries during the last 100 to 200 years 


1  According to paragraph 1  each of the following is true of Spartina alrerniflora EXCEPT  
 It rarely flowers in salt marshes 
 It grows well in intertidal zones 
 It is commonly referred to as cordgrass 
 It occurs naturally along the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast of the United States 


2  According to paragraph 2  a major reason why natural salt marshes are so productive is that they are
 inhabited by long lived seaweed and marsh grasses that reproduce gradually
 kept clear of excess plant material by the tides
 regularly supplied with high levels of nutrients
 home to a wide variety of different species of grasses

3  Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Insects feed only on dead cordgrass  while most other marsh inhabitants feed on live cordgrass 
 The marsh is a good habitat for insects  but a relatively poor one for birds and animals 
 Although cordgrass provides food for birds and animals  it gives insects both food and a place to live 
 Cordgrass provides food for numerous insects  birds  and other animals 







4  What is the organizational structure of paragraph 3 
 It makes a general claim about Spartina and then provides specific evidence to defend that claim against objections to the claim 
 It presents a general characterization of Spartina and then describes particular features on which this characterization is based 
 It reports a widely held view about Spartina and then considers evidence both for and against that view 
 It presents a general hypothesis about Spartina and then lists specific evidence that disputes that hypothesis 
5  The word  exceedingly  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unusually
 dangerously

6  According to paragraph 3  one reason that Spartina is able to compete in marsh environments so successfully is its ability to 
 alter the substrate in which it grows
 convert sulfides into a usable form of sulfur
 grow and produce seeds while floating on the surface of the water
 produce carbon dioxide with great efficiency


7  Paragraph 4 suggests that where Spartinaoccurs naturally  an established stand of it will eventually 
 create conditions in which it can no longer survive
 get washed away by water flowing through the deep channels that form around it
 become adapted to brackish water
 take over other grass species growing in the area
8  According to paragraph 4  in its natural habitats  Spartina helps estuaries by 
 controlling marshland decline
 decreasing the substrate elevation
 reducing the brackishness of the water
 increasing the flow of water into the estuary

9  According to paragraph 5  Spartina negatively affects wildlife in estuaries by 
 trapping fish and waterfowl in sediment
 preventing oysters from transplanting successfully
 turning mudflats into high marshes and salt meadows
 expanding the marshy fringes of salt meadows

10  The word  modifies  in the passage is closest in meaning to

Answers

 Spartina is very well adapted to conditions in salt marshes  where it plays a valuable role in stabilizing them and making them highly productive marine habitats 
 Spartina expands by growing root systems that float on the water s surface and descend underground  where it finds the nutrients that it needs to germinate 
 As a result of its spread in Washington State over the past hundred years  Spartina has now become a threat to native oysters by releasing sediments that contain sulfides into the waters 
 The dead leaves of Spartina become food for a wide variety of marine organisms 
 Outside its native regions  Spartina can pose serious problems by turning mudflats into high marshes that are inhospitable to many native fish and birds 
 Spartina has physiological adaptations that allow it to grow in environments where other plants cannot  making it a very strong competitor that is difficult to control once it is established 








 
The Birth of Photography

Perceptions of the visible world were greatly altered by the invention of photography in the middle of the nineteenth century  In particular  and quite logically  the art of painting was forever changed  though not always in the ways one might have expected  The realistic and naturalistic painters of the mid  and late nineteenth century were all intently aware of photography as a thing to use  to learn from  and react to 
Unlike most major inventions  photography had been long and impatiently awaited  The images produced by the camera obscura  a boxlike device that used a pinhole or lens to throw an image onto a ground glass screen or a piece of white paper  were already familiar the device had been much employed by topographical artists like the Italian painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the city of Venice  What was lacking was a way of giving such images permanent form  This was finally achieved by Louis Daguerre  1787 1851   who perfected a way of fixing them on a silvered copper plate  His discovery  the  daguerreotype   was announced in 1839 
A second and very different process was patented by the British inventor William Henry Talbot  1800 1877  in 1841  Talbot s  calotype  was the first negative to positive process and the direct ancestor of the modern photograph  The calotype was revolutionary in its use of chemically treated paper in which areas hit by light became dark in tone  producing a negative image  This  negative   as Talbot called it  could then be used to print multiple positive images on another piece of treated paper 
The two processes produced very different results  The daguerreotype was a unique image that reproduced what was in front of the camera lens in minute  unselective detail and could not be duplicated  The calotype could be made in series  and was thus the equivalent of an etching or an engraving  Its general effect was soft edged and tonal 
One of the things that most impressed the original audience for photography was the idea of authenticity  Nature now seemed able to speak for itself  with a minimum of interference  The title Talbot chose for his book  The Pencil of Nature  the first part of which was published in 1844   reflected this feeling  Artists were fascinated by photography because it offered a way of examining the world in much greater detail  They were also afraid of it  because it seemed likely to make their own efforts unnecessary 
Photography did indeed make certain kinds of painting obsolete the daguerreotype virtually did away with the portrait miniature  It also made the whole business of making and owning images democratic  Portraiture  once a luxury for the privileged few  was suddenly well within the reach of many more people 
In the long term  photography s impact on the visual arts was far from simple  Because the medium was so prolific  in the sense that it was possible to produce a multitude of images very cheaply  it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art  rather than its destined successor  Even those artists who were most dependent on photography became reluctant to admit that they made use of it  in case this compromised their professional standing 
The rapid technical development of photography the introduction of lighter and simpler equipment  and of new emulsions that coated photographic plates  film  and paper and enabled images to be made at much faster speeds had   some unanticipated consequences  Scientific experiments made by photographers such as Eadweard Muybridge  1830 1904  and Etienne Jules Marey  1830 1904  demonstrated that the movements of both humans and animals differed widely from the way they had been traditionally represented in art  Artists  often reluctantly  were forced to accept the evidence provided by the camera  The new candid photography unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken confirmed these scientific results  and at the same time  thanks to the radical cropping  trimming  of images that the camera often imposed  suggested new compositional formats  The accidental effects obtained by candid photographers were soon being copied by artists such as the French painter Degas 



1  What can be inferred from paragraphs 1 and 2 about the effect of photography on nineteenth century painting 
 Photography did not significantly change the way people looked at reality 
 Most painters used the images of the camera obscura in preference to those of the daguerreotype 
 Painters who were concerned with realistic or naturalistic representation were particularly influenced by photography 
 Artists used the long awaited invention of photography in just the ways they had expected to 
2  According to paragraphs 2 and 3 which of the following did the daguerreotype and the calotype have in common 
 They were equally useful for artists 
 They could be reproduced 
 They produced a permanent image
 They were produced on treated paper

 repetition


6  What point does the author make in paragraph 6 
 Paintings became less expensive because of competition with photography 
 Photography  unlike painting  was a type of portraiture that even ordinary people could afford 
 Every style of painting was influenced by the invention of photography 
 The daguerreotype was more popular than the calotype

8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Photography did not replace other fine arts because people felt the image looked cheap in relation to the other arts 
 Photography was not considered a true art because people could use it to create many images cheaply 
 Photography was so cheap and readily available that it could be purchased by people who were too poor to purchase fine art 
 Photography not only spread quickly but  also was a cheap art form and so became true successor of fine arts rather than its poor relation

11  Which of the following is mentioned in paragraph 8 as a benefit that artists derived from photography 
 It inspired artists to use technological themes in their painting 
 It lent prestige to those artists who used photographs as models for paintings
 It provided artists with new types of equipment to speed up the painting process 
 It motivated artists to think about new ways to compose images in their paintings 
12  It can be inferred from paragraph 8 that one effect that photography had on painting was that it 
 provided painters with new insights into how humans and animals actually move
 showed that representing movement could be as interesting as portrait art
 increased the appeal of painted portraiture among the wealthy
 influenced artists to improve techniques for painting faster

Answer Choices

 For a brief time  artists preferred not to paint natural or realistic images that would have to compete with photographs 
 Before photography  Canaletto had used the camera obscura to project scenes onto a paper or glass plate 
 The photographic processes of Louis Daguerre and William Henry Talbot both made permanent images  but only Talbot s process allowed making multiple copies 
 The work of Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne Jules Marey established photography both as a science and as an art 
 Photography made accurate images widely and inexpensively available  but this popular success also had the effect of lowering its perceived value in relation to the fine arts

Sometime after midnight on February 8  1969  a large  bright meteor entered Earth s atmosphere and broke into thousands of pieces  plummeted to the ground  and scattered over an area 50 miles long and 10 miles wide in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico  The first meteorite from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende  Altogether  roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered  all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery 
Individual specimens of Allende are covered with a black  glassy crust that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth s atmosphere  When broken open  Allende stones are revealed to contain an assortment of small  distinctive objects  spherical or irregular in shape and embedded in a dark gray matrix  binding material   which were once constituents of the solar nebula the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which our solar system was formed 
The Allende meteorite is classified as a chondrite  Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros meaning  seed  an allusion to their appearance as rocks containing tiny seeds  These seeds are actually chondrules  millimeter sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal  A few chondrules contain grains that survived the melting event  so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when compact masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures approaching 1 700 degrees Celsius and then cooled before these surviving grains could melt  Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly  in times measured in minutes or hours  so the heating events that formed them must have been localized  It seems very unlikely that large portions of the nebula were heated to such extreme temperatures  and huge nebula areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast  Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the nebula that were able to lose heat rapidly  The origin of these peculiar glassy spheres remains an enigma 
Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions  irregular white masses that tend to be larger than chondrules  They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth  all rich in calcium  aluminum  and titanium  the most refractory  resistant to melting  of the major elements in the nebula  The same minerals that occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the earliest formed substances to have condensed out of the solar nebula  However  studies of the textures of inclusions reveal that the order in which the minerals appeared in the inclusions varies from inclusion to inclusion  and often does not match the theoretical condensation sequence for those metals 
Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix  a mixture of fine grained  mostly silicate minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron sulfide  At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be pristine nebular dust  the sort of stuff from which chondrules and inclusions were made  However  detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it  too  has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula  although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials 
All these diverse constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites  like Allende  that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun  To compare the compositions of a meteorite and the Sun  it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than simply the abundances of atoms  After all  the Sun has many more   atoms of any element  say iron  than does a meteorite specimen  but the ratios of iron to silicon in the two kinds of matter might be comparable  The compositional similarity is striking  The major difference is that Allende is depleted in the most volatile elements  like hydrogen  carbon  oxygen  nitrogen  and the noble gases  relative to the Sun  These are the elements that tend to form gases even at very low temperatures  We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun  a sort of solar sludge from which only gases have been removed  Since practically all the solar system s mass resides in the Sun  this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have average solar system composition  except for the most volatile elements  they are truly lumps of nebular matter  probably similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled

Studies of the Allende meteorite provided information about the composition of chondritic meteorites and their possible origin 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 When Allende entered Earth s atmosphere  it broke into thousands of pieces called chondrites because they look like glassy  black seeds 
 The mineral content of chondrules suggests that they were probably formed in isolated regions of the nebula that remained much hotter than the rest 
 Chondrules are tiny  millimeter sized drops of silicate materials that probably formed when lumps of nebular dust were fused at extremely high temperatures and then quickly cooled 
 Irregularly shaped inclusions in Allende are composed of minerals that are resistant to melting and are believed to be the earliest minerals to have condensed out of the nebula 
 The matrix that holds the chondrules and inclusions together in Allende consists mainly of grains of nebular dust that were trapped inside the meteor before they could be melted 
 Except for being depleted in volatile elements  chondritic meteorites are probably very similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled

Urban Climates

The city is an extraordinary processor of mass and energy and has its own metabolism  A daily input of water  food  and energy of various kinds is matched by an output of sewage  solid waste  air pollutants  energy  and materials that have been transformed in some way  The quantities involved are enormous  Many aspects of this energy use affect the atmosphere of a city  particularly in the production of heat  

In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun  All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air  a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated  But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter  and if a house were perfectly insulated  one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it  Therefore  even without any industrial production of heat  an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it 

The burning of fuel  such as by cars  is not the only source of this increased heat  Two other factors contribute to the higher overall temperature in cities  The first is the heat capacity of the materials that constitute the city  which is typically dominated by concrete and asphalt  During the day  heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored to be released at night  But in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity because a vegetative blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground  The second factor is that radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways   1  by a continuing series of reflection among the numerous vertical surfaces that buildings present and  2  by the dust dome  the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce  Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome more easily than outgoing longwave radiation does  the latter is absorbed by the gaseous pollutants of the dome and reradiated back to the urban surface  

Cities  then  are warmer than the surrounding rural areas  and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island  Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds  but they can form almost any time  The precise configuration of a heat island depends on several factors  For example  the wind can make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows  When a heat island is well developed  variations can be extreme  in winter  busy streets in cities can be 1 7℃warmer than the side streets  Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving  The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat island intensity for that region  In general  the larger the city  the greater its heat island intensity  The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout  population density  and productive activities of a metropolis 

The surface atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic peculiarities  For one thing  the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special qualities of the urban surface  With much of the built up landscape impenetrable by water  even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from      rooftops  streets  and parking lots  Thus  city surfaces  as well as the air above them  tend to be drier between episodes of rain  with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation  relative humidities are usually lower  Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them  This friction tends to slow the speed of winds  making them far less efficient at dispersing pollutants  On the other hand  air turbulence increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow  Rainfall is also increased in cities  The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built up surface

3   According to paragraph 2  how soon heat from a warmed house reaches the outside air is greatly affected by
 how well the house is heated
 how well the house is insulated
 how many adults live in the house
 how much sunshine the house receives







4  According to paragraph 3  each of the following contributes to making urban areas warmer than the surrounding countryside EXCEPT 
 the fuel burned by motor vehicles 
 the capacity to store heat of the materials used in building a city 
 the easy flow of heat into the ground in city areas covered by vegetation 
 the repeated reflection of solar radiation back and forth among buildings

5  According to paragraph 3  why do materials in the countryside have a lower heat capacity than materials in cities do 
 The countryside in the Sun is the only important source of heat 
 Construction materials in the city are not as good at keeping buildings warm as they are in the countryside 
 In the countryside the solar heat that flows into the ground flows out again quickly 
  Countryside vegetation prevents heat from being trapped in the ground 

6  How is paragraph 3 organized 
  It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and then provides two causes for the second factor 
  It describes two causes discovered in an early analysis of the increased heat of cities 
  It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and two other factors that work against it 
  It describes two well established causes of the increased heat of cities and other two whose roles are less well understood

  The overall size of the heat island that includes the two reasons 
  The intensity of the heat island that includes the two areas 
  Differences between the two areas in the general level of activity  including traffic
 Differences between the two areas in the insulation materials used in construction



 9  Paragraph 4 supports the idea that a city s heat island intensity would increase if
 the city went into an economic decline and lost population
 the city s economy shifted from heavy industry to health care and education
 there was an upward trend in the average age of the city s residents
 repair work on the streets slowed traffic throughout the city






10  According to paragraph 5  surfaces in the city are generally drier than surfaces in the countryside between periods of rainfall because 
 in the city gentle rain is much more common than heavy rain
 high temperatures in the city speed up the process of evaporation
 in the city there are longer periods of dry weather between episodes of rain
  rainwater in the city cannot soak into most surfaces and quickly runs off

 Attempts to reduce urban air pollution
 The effects of tall buildings on airflow


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage 
     Another possibility is for the heat island to be stretched along the course of major rivers  since large waterways typically have a warming effect on the air directly above them

Cities create climatic conditions of their own through their physical structure and urban activities 
 
 
 
Answer Choices

 The amount of heat produced in a city will be reduced when cities use the heat from cars to warm homes 
 The built up landscape of the city readily becomes a heat island  with greater water runoff and special climatic conditions such as low relative humidity and increased air turbulence 
 The materials from which cities are built and the effects of pollution domes help make urban areas warmer than rural areas 
 Cities tend to be warmer than their surrounding areas  in part because they produce heat by burning fuel for heating  powering vehicles  and industrial production 
 In most cities  the heating that results from solar radiation is intensified by carbon dioxide  a gas that is present at very high concentrations in cities  atmospheres    
 During periods without rainfall  the air in cities heats up and causes winds to slow down  with the result that pollutants are not dispersed 












Seventeenth Century Dutch Agriculture
Agriculture and fishing formed the primary sector of the economy in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century  Dutch agriculture was modernized and commercialized new crops and agricultural techniques raised levels of production so that they were in line with market demands  and cheap grain was imported annually from the Baltic region in large quantities  According to estimates  about 120 000 tons of imported grain fed about 600 000 people  that is about a third of the Dutch population  Importing the grain  which would have been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch to have produced themselves  kept the price of grain low and thus stimulated individual demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods 
Apart from this  being able to give up labor intensive grain production freed both the land and the workforce for more productive agricultural divisions  The peasants specialized in livestock husbandry and dairy farming as well as in cultivating industrial crops and fodder crops  flax  madder  and rape were grown  as were tobacco  hops  and turnips  These products were bought mostly by urban businesses  There was also a demand among urban consumers for dairy products such as butter and cheese  which  in the sixteenth century  had become more expensive than grain  The high prices encouraged the peasants to improve their animal husbandry techniques  for example  they began feeding their animals indoors in order to raise the milk yield of their cows 
In addition to dairy farming and cultivating industrial crops  a third sector of the Dutch economy reflected the way in which agriculture was being modernized horticulture  In the sixteenth century  fruit and vegetables were to be found only in gardens belonging to wealthy people  This changed in the early part of the seventeenth century when horticulture became accepted as an agricultural sector  Whole villages began to cultivate fruit and vegetables  The produce was then transported by water to markets in the cities  where the consumption of fruit and vegetables was no longer restricted to the wealthy 
As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and industry increased  agricultural land became more valuable and people tried to work the available land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes  In order to increase production on existing land  the peasants made more use of crop rotation and  in particular  began to apply animal waste to the soil regularly  rather than leaving the fertilization process up to the grazing livestock  For the first time industrial waste  such as ash from the soap boilers  was collected in the cities and sold in the country as artificial fertilizer  The increased yield and price of land justified reclaiming and draining even more land 
The Dutch battle against the sea is legendary  Noorderkwartier in Holland  with its numerous lakes and stretches of water  was particularly suitable for land reclamation and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster Lake which began in 1608  The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7 100 hectares of land  Forty three windmills powered the drainage pumps so that they were able to lease the reclamation to farmers as early as 1612  with the investors receiving annual leasing payments at an interest rate of 17 percent  Land reclamation continued  and between 1590 and 1665  almost 100 000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland  Zeeland  and Friesland  However  land reclamation decreased significantly after the middle of the seventeenth century because the price of agricultural products began to fall  making land reclamation far less profitable in the second part of the century 

Dutch agriculture was finally affected by the general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last two decades of the seventeenth century  However  what is astonishing about this is not that Dutch agriculture was affected by critical phenomena such as a decrease in sales and production  but the fact that the crisis appeared only relatively late in Dutch agriculture  In Europe as a whole  the exceptional reduction in the population and the related fall in demand for grain since the beginning of the seventeenth century had caused the price of agricultural products to fall  Dutch peasants were able to remain unaffected by this crisis for a long time because they had specialized in dairy farming industrial crops  and horticulture  However  toward the end of the seventeenth century  they too were overtaken by the general agricultural crisis 

1  By indicating that production was in line with market demands the author means that Dutch farmers were able to
 exceed other European countries in agricultural production

Answer Choices

 The Baltic region produced large quantities of grain for export to other regions  including the Netherlands 
 The richest people grew enough fruits and vegetables to supply the entire country with fresh produce 
 An agricultural crisis that began in Europe did not affect Dutch land reclamation projects 
 Specialization in dairy farming  industrial crops  and horticulture allowed the Dutch to be more productive than some other regions in Europe 
 Land reclamation and improvement allowed the Dutch to meet demands for their agricultural products 
 Because the Dutch had specialized their agricultural output they were less susceptible to the crisis that Europe experienced from the beginning of the century 










Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines
Ever since European first explored Australia  people have been trying to understand the ancient rock drawings and carvings created by the Aborigines  the original inhabitants of the continent  Early in the nineteenth century  encounters with Aboriginal rock art tended to be infrequent and open to speculative interpretation  but since the late nineteenth century  awareness of the extent and variety of Australian rock art has been growing  In the latter decades of the twentieth century there were intensified efforts to understand and record the abundance of Australian rock art 

The systematic study of this art is a relatively new discipline in Australia  Over the past four decades new discoveries have steadily added to the body of knowledge  The most significant data have come from a concentration on three major questions  First  what is the age of Australian rock art  Second  what is its stylistic organization and is it possible to discern a sequence or a pattern of development between styles  Third  is it possible to interpret accurately the subject matter of ancient rock art  bring to bear all available archaeological techniques and the knowledge of present day Aboriginal informants 

The age of Australia s rock art is constantly being revised  and earlier datings have been proposed as the result of new discoveries  Currently  reliable scientific evidence dates the earliest creation of art on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere between 30 000 and 50 000 years ago  This in itself is an almost incomprehensible span of generations  and one that makes Australia s rock art the oldest continuous art tradition in the world 

Although the remarkable antiquity of Australia s rock art is now established  the sequences and meanings of its images have been widely debated  Since the mid 1970s  a reasonably stable picture has formed of the organization of Australian rock art  In order to create a sense of structure to this picture  researchers have relied on a distinction that still underlies the forms of much indigenous visual culture a distinction between geometric and figurative elements  Simple geometric repeated patterns circles  concentric circles  and lines constitute the iconography  characteristic images  of the earliest rock art sites found across Australia  The frequency with which certain simple motifs appear in these oldest sites has led rock art researchers to adopt a descriptive term the Panaramitee style a label which takes its name from the extensive rock pavements at Panaramitee North in desert South Australia  which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface  Certain features of these engravings lead to the conclusion that they are of great age geological changes had clearly happened after the designs had been made and local Aboriginal informants  when first questioned about them  seemed to know nothing of their origins  Furthermore  the designs were covered with  desert varnish   a glaze that develops on rock surfaces over thousands of years of exposure to the elements  The simple motifs found at Panaramitee are common to many rock art sites across Australia  Indeed  sites with engravings of geometric shapes are also to be found on the island of Tasmania  which was separated from the mainland of the continent some 10 000 years ago 

In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development  with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear  Lesley Maynard  the archaeologist who coined the phrase  Panaramitee style   suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art  in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style  outlines of figures and animals   followed by a range of complex figurative styles that  unlike the pan Australian geometric tradition  tended to much greater regional diversity  While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites  which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia  in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important  In this context the simplicity of a geometric motif may be more apparent than real  Motifs of seeming simplicity can encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia  And has not twentieth century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine sequence

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave ways or leave out essential information 
 The oldest rock art sites have simpler motifs than the best known sites of Panaramitee North 
 Because motifs primarily associated with the Panaramitee region are common in the oldest sites the term Panaramitee style has become the general term for rock art of this type 
 Because the Panaramitee style is so common in the older sites  researchers have described it most extensively 
 The motifs carved in the rocky surface of the Panaramitee region make up the oldest form of rock art discovered in Australia 

7  According to paragraph 4  researchers have organized and structured Australian rock art by distinguishing between which of the following 
 Images found at Panaramitee North and images found in other parts of Australia
 Images found in a particular type of rock layer and images found in other types of rock layers
 Images that have geometric elements and images that have figurative elements
 Images that are typically found and image that are rarely found

8  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are signs of the great age of the Panaramitee engravings EXCEPT 
 The engravings consisted of simple animal drawings 
 The engravings were covered with a layer of a substance known as  desert varnish  
 Local Aborigines who were asked knew nothing about the origin of the engravings 
 Geologic changes had occurred after the engravings were made 

9  Why does the author include information about Tasmania in paragraph 4 
 To provide evidence that the Panaramitee style is widespread and of great age 
 To prove that Aboriginal Australians could not have made the carvings in Tasmania
 To indicate how researchers have determined how long ago Tasmania separated from the mainland
 To illustrate the importance of geometric rock art to tourism in Tasmania




10  According to paragraph 5  the complex figurative style differs from the geometric style in that the complex figurative style 
 varies significantly from region to region
 is more meaningful
 appears on only a few types of rocks   
 has changed little overtime

11  According to paragraph 5  Lesley Maynard made which of the following suggestions about Australian rock art 
 There were a pattern of human figures being represented in a more complex style than animal figures 
 Australian archaeology should concentrate on determining the sequence of styles that led up to the Panaramitee style 
 The great antiquity of Australian rock art would probably make it impossible to determine the ages of the various styles found in rock art 
 The geometric style of Australian rock art was replaced by increasingly complex figurative styles 

12  In paragraph 5  the author indicates that twentieth century art has shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermined sequence in order to
 emphasize that it may not be possible to determine what the figures in ancient rock art represent
 suggest a reply to those who have questioned Maynard s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art
 provide a counterexample to Maynard s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art
 indicate that twentieth century art is more advanced than ancient rock art

 A sequence from geometric to more representative art fits many sites but does not necessarily indicate a progression from simple to complex meaning                                                                                                                                                                                        
 In determining the way in which Australian rock art was organized  archaeologists have made little distinction between geometric and figurative elements 
 Older examples of rock art consist of simple  repeated geometric patterns while later rock art includes figures and animals 
 Aboriginal informants were able to explain the meanings of ancient rock art symbols

Lake Water
Where does the water in a lake come from  and how does water leave it  Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers  from underwater seeps and springs  from overland flow off the surrounding land  and from rain falling directly on the lake surface  Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers  by soaking into the bed of the lake  and by evaporation  So much is obvious 
The questions become more complicated when actual volumes of water are considered  how much water enters and leaves by each route  Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and outflowing stream and river  Then exchanges with the atmosphere are calculated by finding the difference between the gains from rain  as measured  rather roughly  by rain gauges  and the losses by evaporation  measured with models that correct for the other sources of water loss  For the majority of lakes  certainly those surrounded by forests  input from overland flow is too small to have a noticeable effect  Changes in lake level not explained by river flows plus exchanges with the atmosphere must be due to the net difference between what seeps into the lake from the groundwater and what leaks into the groundwater  Note the word  net   measuring the actual amounts of groundwater seepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more complicated matter than merely inferring their difference 
Once all this information has been gathered  it becomes possible to judge whether a lake s flow is mainly due to its surface inputs and outputs or to its underground inputs and outputs  If the former are greater  the lake is a surface water dominated lake  if the latter  it is a seepage dominated lake  Occasionally  common sense tells you which of these two possibilities applies  For example  a pond in hilly country that maintains a steady water level all through a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into it must obviously be seepage dominated  Conversely  a pond with a stream flowing in one end and out the other  which dries up when the stream dries up  is clearly surface water dominated 
By whatever means  a lake is constantly gaining water and losing water  its water does not just sit there  or  anyway  not for long  This raises the matter of a lake s residence time  The residence time is the average length of time that any particular molecule of water remains in the lake  and it is calculated by dividing the volume of water in the lake by the rate at which water leaves the lake  The residence time is an average  the time spent in the lake by a given molecule  if we could follow its fate  would depend on the route it took  it might flow through as part of the fastest  most direct current  or it might circle in a backwater for an indefinitely long time 
Residence times vary enormously  They range from a few days for small lakes up to several hundred years for large ones  Lake Tahoe  in California  has a residence time of 700 years  The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America  namely  Lakes Superior  Michigan  Huron  Erie  and Ontario  are  respectively  190 100 22 2 5  and 6 years  Lake Erie s is the lowest  although its area is larger than Lake Ontario s  its volume is less than one third as great because it is so shallow less than 20 meters on average 
A given lake s residence time is by no means a fixed quantity  It depends on the rate at which water enters the lake  and that depends on the rainfall and the evaporation rate  Climatic change  the result of global warming   is dramatically affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario  Canada  In the period 1970 to 1986  rainfall in the area decreased from 1 000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum  while above average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration rate  the rate at which water is lost to the atmosphere through evaporation and the processes of plant life  
The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period  The slowing down of water renewal leads to a chain of further consequences  it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated  and this  in turn  has a marked effect on all living things in the lake

This question is worth 2 points 
Water enters  remains  and eventually leaves a lake in a variety of ways 
 
 
 







Answer Choices


 By measuring the water quantities at each of a lake s inputs and outputs  it can be determined whether water enters the lake mainly from surface or groundwater sources 
 Changes in lake level and volume are caused principally by the amount of evaporation of water into the atmosphere 
 It is sometimes possible to decide whether a lake is surface water dominated or seepage dominated by simple observation at different seasons 
 The average period of time that molecules of water spend in a lake the residence time varies from lake to lake and overtime within a particular lake 
 The residence times of surface water dominated lakes are usually longer than those of seepage dominated lakes 
 The residence time of a lake frequently depends on the kinds of organisms to be found in the lake 










 
Breathing During Sleep
Of all the physiological differences in human sleep compared with wakefulness that have been discovered in the last decade  changes in respiratory control are most dramatic  Not only are there differences in the level of the functioning of respiratory systems  there are even changes in how they function  Movements of the rib cage for breathing are reduced during sleep  making the contractions of the diaphragm more important  Yet because of the physics of lying down  the stomach applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it more difficult for the diaphragm to do its job  However  there are many other changes that affect respiration when asleep 
During wakefulness  breathing is controlled by two interacting systems  The first is an automatic  metabolic system whose control is centered in the brain stem  It subconsciously adjusts breathing rate and depth in order to regulate the levels of carbon dioxide  CO2  and oxygen  O2   and the acid base ratio in the blood  The second system is the voluntary  behavioral system  Its control center is based in the forebrain  and it regulates breathing for use in speech  singing  sighing  and so on  It is capable of ignoring or overriding the automatic  metabolic system and produces an irregular pattern of breathing 
During NREM  the phase of sleep in which there is no rapid eye movement  breathing becomes deeper and more regular  but there is also a decrease in the breathing rate  resulting in less air being exchanged overall  This occurs because during NREM sleep the automatic  metabolic system has exclusive control over breathing and the body uses less oxygen and produces less carbon dioxide  Also  during sleep the automatic metabolic system is less responsive to carbon dioxide levels and oxygen levels in the blood  Two things result from these changes in breathing control that occur during sleep  First  there may be a brief cessation or reduction of breathing when falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes between sleep and wakefulness and their differing control mechanisms  Second  once sleep is fully obtained  there is an increase of carbon dioxide and a decrease of oxygen in the blood that persists during NREM 

But that is not all that changes  During all phases of sleep  several changes in the air passages have been observed  It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater resistance to airflow in the airways and changes in the efficiency of the muscles used for breathing  Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when breathing tend to become more relaxed during sleep  especially during REM  the phase of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement   Without this muscular action  inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon the narrow passages tend to collapse  Also there is a regular cycle of change in resistance between the two sides of the nose  If something blocks the  good  side  such as congestion from allergies or a cold  then resistance increases dramatically  Coupled with these factors is the loss of the complex interactions among the muscles that can change the route of airflow from nose to mouth 

Other respiratory regulating mechanisms apparently cease functioning during sleep  For example  during wakefulness   there is an immediate  automatic  adaptive increase in breathing effort when inhaling is made more difficult  such as breathing through a restrictive face mask   This reflexive adjustment is totally absent during NREM sleep  Only after several inadequate breaths under such conditions  resulting in the considerable elevation of carbon dioxide and reduction of oxygen in the blood  is breathing effort adjusted  Finally  the coughing reflex in reaction to irritants in the airway produces not a cough during sleep but a cessation of breathing  If the irritation is severe enough  a sleeping person will arouse  clear the airway  then resume breathing and likely return to sleep 

Additional breathing changes occur during REM sleep that are even more dramatic than the changes that occur during NREM  The amount of air exchanged is even lower in REM than NREM because  although breathing is more rapid in REM  it is also more irregular  with brief episodes of shallow breathing or absence of breathing  In addition  breathing during REM depends much more on the action of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage action 












1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following can be inferred about the diaphragm during sleep 
 During sleep the diaphragm requires increased movement of the rib cage 
 The diaphragm helps with breathing as movements of the rib cage decrease during sleep 
 The diaphragm requires a great amount of pressure to function properly 
 The diaphragm contributes to the effective functioning of the rib cage 

2  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are true of the voluntary breathing system EXCEPT 
 It has its control center in the brain stem 
 It controls breathing for a number of activities during wakefulness    
 It is able to bypass the automatic system 
 It produces an irregular breathing pattern 













3  The word exclusive in the passage is closest in meaning to
 consistent
 perfect
 partial
 sole

4  According to paragraph 3  which of the following may occur just before NREM sleep begins 
 The automatic  metabolic system may increase its dependence on air exchanges 
 Breathing can stop for a short time as a person falls asleep 
 An increase in the oxygen level in the blood can occur as sleep becomes fully obtained 
 The level of carbon dioxide in the blood may drop suddenly 

5  What is the author s purpose in stating that inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon 
 To refute the argument that additional effort is necessary for breathing during sleep
 To argue that REM sleep is more important than NREM sleep
 To illustrate the difficulty of breathing during sleep
 To illustrate how blockage of narrow passages can be prevented during sleep   

6  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as being characteristic of breathing during sleep EXCEPT
 relaxation of the muscles involved in the respiratory system
 changes in resistance between the two sides of the nose
 easier airflow in the passages of the upper airway
 absence of certain complex muscle interactions


7  According to paragraph 5  what happens during NREM sleep when inhaling is difficult 
 There is an immediate  automatic  adaptive increase in breathing effort 
 The sleeping person takes several inadequate breaths before the breathing effort is adjusted 
 The coughing reflex causes the breathing effort to adjust  
 The airways become cleared as the blood removes irritants 

8  It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that a very mild irritation during sleep will likely cause the sleeping person to
 increase the breathing effort
 wake up and remove the source of irritation
 cough while still sleeping
 stop breathing temporarily while still sleeping

9  The word considerable is closest in meaning to
 significant 
 Steady
 Usual
 necessary

11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Because breathing is more shallow and irregular in REM than in NREM  less air is exchanged in REM 
 Breathing in NREM is less effective than breathing in REM because of irregular episodes of rapid breathing during NREM

Moving into Pueblos
In the Mesa Verde area of the ancient North American Southwest  living patterns changed in the thirteenth century  with large numbers of people moving into large communal dwellings called pueblos  often constructed at the edges of canyons  especially on the sides of cliffs  Abandoning small extended family households to move into these large pueblos with dozens if not hundreds of other people was probably traumatic  Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today allow us to deal with dense populations existed for these people accustomed to household autonomy and the ability to move around the landscape almost at will  And besides the awkwardness of having to share walls with neighbors  living in aggregated pueblos introduced other problems  For people in cliff dwellings  hauling water  wood  and food to their homes was a major chore  The stress on local resources  especially in the firewood needed for daily cooking and warmth  was particularly intense  and conditions in aggregated pueblos were not very hygienic 

Given all the disadvantages of living in aggregated towns  why did people in the thirteenth century move into these closely packed quarters  For transitions of such suddenness  archaeologists consider either pull factors  benefits that drew families together  or push factors  some external threat or crisis that forced people to aggregate   In this case  push explanations dominate 

Population growth is considered a particularly influential push  After several generations of population growth  people packed the landscape in densities so high that communal pueblos may have been a necessary outcome  Around Sand Canyon  for example  populations grew from 5  12 people per square kilometer in the tenth century to as many as 30   50 by the 1200s  As densities increased  domestic architecture became larger  culminating in crowded pueblos  Some scholars expand on this idea by emphasizing a corresponding need for arable land to feed growing numbers of people  construction of small dams  reservoirs  terraces  and field houses indicates that farmers were intensifying their efforts during the 1200s  Competition for good farmland may also have prompted people to bond together to assert rights over the best fields 

Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age  a climatic phenomenon that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere  Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner  some evidence suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth century  The environmental changes associated with this transition are not fully understood  but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains  to the northeast of Mesa Verde  were affected first  Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season  As the Little Ice Age progressed  farmers probably moved their fields to lower elevations  infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together  thus contributing to the aggregations  Archaeologists identify a corresponding shift in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations 

In the face of all these pushes  people in the Mesa Verde area had yet another reason to move into communal villages  the need for greater cooperation  Sharing and cooperation were almost certainly part of early Puebloan life  even for people living in largely independent single household residences scattered across the landscape  Archaeologists find that even the most isolated residences during the eleventh and twelfth centuries obtained some pottery  and probably food  from some distance away  while major ceremonial events were opportunities for sharing food and crafts  Scholars believe that this cooperation allowed people to contend with a patchy environment in which precipitation and other resources varied across the landscape  if you produce a lot of food one year  you might trade it for pottery made by a distant ally who is having difficulty with crops and the next year  the flow of goods might go in the opposite direction  But all of this appears to have changed thirteenth century  Although the climate remained as unpredictable as ever between one year and the next  it became much less locally diverse  In a bad year for farming  everyone was equally affected  No longer was it helpful to share widely  Instead  the most sensible thing would be for neighbors to combine efforts to produce as much food as possible  and thus aggregated towns were a sensible arrangement

3  According to paragraph 1  before the thirteenth century the people of southwestern North America lived in households that
 shared daily chores with neighboring households

 It casts doubt on one explanation of the move to pueblos and then introduces an alternative explanation that the passage will defend 
 It describes a major change in a population  s living patterns and then presents a number of problems that resulted from that change 








5  According to paragraph 3  which of the following was one of the consequences of increasing population densities 
 People were increasingly crowded into collections of large housing units 
 People stopped planting crops that have relatively low yields  
 Domestic buildings were pushed beyond the canyon limits  
 The natural landscape was destroyed 

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Some scholars even claim that the intensification of farmers  various efforts during the 1200s led to further population growth and the consequent need for more arable land 
 Evidence of intensifying agriculture in the 1200s indicates a need to feed a larger population and so extends the argument that a growing population was the cause of the move to pueblos 
 During the 1200s  farmers met the demand for more arable land  but they also succeeded in cultivating existing land more intensively with the help of agricultural construction projects 
 Some scholars feel strongly that the construction of small dams  reservoirs  terraces  and field houses in the thirteenth century is independent evidence for growth in the number of people

 To argue that farming was not the primary source of food at high elevations

9  According to paragraph 4  what did farmers do in response to falling temperatures during the Little Ice Age 
 Moved to areas away from Mesa Verde
 Moved closer to the northeastern part of Mesa Verde
 Began to cultivate crops adapted to a short growing season
 Gave up the cultivation of the highest lying lands

















10  According to paragraph 5  major ceremonial events were occasions for
 leaders to persuade people from the countryside to move into a pueblo
 farmers to collect information about where crops could be reliably grown 
 people to develop better techniques for producing pottery and crafts

 Individuals were no longer interested in exchanging pottery and food 
 Cooperation between people became more important for survival 
 Bad years of farming began to occur more frequently 

12  Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements about cooperation among the people in the Mesa Verde area from the eleventh through the thirteenth century 
 Cooperation allowed many households to give up farming and to specialize in making pottery and crafts 
 People went from exchanging food and crafts they individually produced to sharing in a cooperative effort to produce as much food as possible 
 Overtime there was less cooperation as farmers competed with each other for trade with distant areas 
 	Individuals stopped cooperating with each other because they did not have enough food for themselves

In the thirteenth century  the people in the Mesa Verde area went from living in scattered independent households to living in large pueblos 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

 Because the thirteenth century inhabitants of the Mesa Verde area did not have the cultural expectations of today s city dwellers  they easily adapted to communal life 
 Even though living in pueblos had disadvantages  the population of the area had grown so large that there may have been no other arrangement that would have met its needs 
 From the eleventh century onward  farmers began to increase food production on existing farmland and started bringing more land under cultivation 
 A development that contributed to increasing population densities was a cooling climate that led many people to leave the coldest areas and crowd into climatically more favorable areas 
 The primary reason for moving to pueblos was the social benefits associated with communal life 
 People were brought together by the need to produce food cooperatively  as the use of food surpluses in one place to relieve shortages in another ended due to a change in climate 










 
TPO 25
The surface of Mars
The surface of Mars shows a wide range of geologic features  including huge volcanoes the largest known in the solar system and extensive impact cratering  Three very large volcanoes are found on the Tharsis bulge  an enormous geologic area near Mars s equator  Northwest of Tharsis is the largest volcano of all  Olympus Mons  with a height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700 kilometers in diameter at its base  The three large volcanoes on the Tharsis bulge are a little smaller a  mere 18 kilometers high 

None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust there is no plate motion on Mars  Instead  they are shield volcanoes   volcanoes with broad  sloping slides formed by molten rock  All four show distinctive lava channels and other flow features similar to those found on shield volcanoes on Earth  Images of the Martian surface reveal many hundreds of volcanoes  Most of the largest volcanoes are associated with the Tharsis bulge  but many smaller ones are found in the northern plains 

The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet s low surface gravity  As lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano  the volcano s eventual height depends on the new mountain s ability to support its own weight  The lower the gravity  the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain  It is no accident that Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height  about 10 kilometers  above their respective bases Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity  Mars s surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth  so volcanoes rise roughly2 5 times as high  Are the Martian shield volcanoes still active  Scientists have no direct evidence for recent or ongoing eruptions  but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago  an estimate of the time of last eruption based on the extent of impact cratering on their slopes   some of them may still be at least intermittently active  Millions of years  though  may pass between eruptions 

Another prominent feature of Mars s surface is cratering  The Mariner spacecraft found that the surface of Mars  as well as that of its two moons  is pitted with impact craters formed by meteoroids falling in from space  As on our Moon  the smaller craters are often filled with surface matter mostly dust confirming that Mars is a dry desert world  However  Martian craters get filled in considerably faster than their lunar counterparts  On the Moon  ancient craters less than 100 meters across  corresponding to depths of about 20 meters  have been obliterated  primarily by meteoritic erosion  On Mars  there are relatively few craters less than 5 kilometers in diameter  The Martian atmosphere is an efficient erosive agent  with Martian winds transporting dust from place to place and erasing surface features much faster than meteoritic impacts alone can obliterate them 

As on the Moon  the extent of large impact cratering  i e  craters too big to have been filled in by erosion since they were formed  serves as an age indicator for the Martian surface  Age estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars s southern highlands to a few hundred million years in the youngest volcanic areas were obtained in this way 

The detailed appearance of Martian impact craters provides an important piece of information about conditions just below the planet s surface  Martian craters are surrounded by ejecta  debris formed as a result of an impact  that looks quite different from its lunar counterparts  A comparison of the Copernicus crater on the Moon with the  fairly typical  crater Yuty on Mars demonstrates the differences  The ejecta surrounding the lunar crater is just what one would expect from an explosion ejecting a large volume of dust  soil  and boulders  However  the ejecta on Mars gives the distinct impression of a liquid that has splashed or flowed out of crater  Geologists think that this fluidized ejecta crater indicates that a layer of permafrost  or water ice  lies just a few meters under the surface  Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice  resulting in the fluid appearance of the ejecta

Volcanoes and impact craters are major features of Martian geology 

 
 
 


Answer Choices

  Plate motion on Mars  once considered to have played no role in shaping the planet s surface  is now seen as being directly associated with the planet s earliest volcanoes 
  Mars has shield volcanoes  some of which are extremely tall because of the planet s low surface gravity 
  Although the erosive power of the Martian atmosphere ensures that Mars has fewer craters than the Moon does  impact craters are prominent on Mars s surface 
  Scientists cannot yet reliably estimate the age of the Martian surface because there has been too much erosion of it 
  Scientists have been surprised to discover that conditions just below the surface of Mars are very similar to conditions just below the surface of the Moon
  Studies of crater ejecta have revealed the possibility of a layer of permafrost below the surface of Mars 

The Decline of Venetian Shipping
In the late thirteenth century  northern Italian cities such as Genoa  Florence  and Venice began an economic resurgence that made them into the most important economic centers of Europe  By the seventeenth century  however  other European powers had taken over  as the Italian cities lost much of their economic might  
This decline can be seen clearly in the changes that affected Venetian shipping and trade  First  Venice s intermediary functions in the Adriatic Sea  where it had dominated the business of shipping for other parties  were lost to direct trading  In the fifteenth century there was little problem recruiting sailors to row the galleys  large ships propelled by oars   guilds  business associations  were required to provide rowers  and through a draft system free citizens served compulsorily when called for  In the early sixteenth century the shortage of rowers was not serious because the demand for galleys was limited by a move to round ships  round hulled ships with more cargo space   with required fewer rowers  But the shortage of crews proved to be a greater and greater problem  despite continuous appeal to Venic s tradition of maritime greatness  Even though sailors  wages doubled among the northern Italian cities from 1550 to 1590  this did not elicit an increased supply 
The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale  Venice s huge and powerful shipyard  Timber ran short  and it was necessary to procure it from farther and farther away  In ancient Roman times  the Italian peninsula had great forest of fir preferred for warships  but scarcity was apparent as early as the early fourteenth century  Arsenale officers first brought timber from the foothills of the Alps  then from north toward Trieste  and finally from across the Adriatic  Private shipbuilders were required to buy their oak abroad  As the costs of shipbuilding rose  Venice clung to its outdated standard while the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more easily handled ships 
The step from buying foreign timber to buying foreign ships was regarded as a short one  especially when complaints were heard in the latter sixteenth century that the standards and traditions of the Arsenale were running down  Work was stretched out and done poorly  Older workers had been allowed to stop work a half hour before the regular time  and in 1601 younger works left with them  Merchants complained that the privileges reserved for Venetian built and owned ships were first extended to those Venetians who bought ships from abroad and then to foreign built and owned vessels  Historian Frederic Lane observes that after the loss of ships in battle in the late sixteenth century  the shipbuilding industry no longer had the capacity to recover that it had displayed at the start of the century  
The conventional explanation for the loss of Venetian dominance in trade is establishment of the Portuguese direct sea route to the East  replacing the overland Silk Road from the Black sea and the highly profitable Indian Ocean caravan eastern Mediterranean route to Venice  The Portuguese Vasco da Gama s Voyage around southern Africa to India took place at the end of the fifteenth century  and by 1502 the trans  Abrabian caravan route had been cut off by political unrest  
The Venetian Council finally allowed round ships to enter the trade that was previously reserved for merchant galleys  thus reducing transport cost by one third  Prices of spices delivered by ship from the eastern Mediterranean came to equal those of spices transported by Portuguese vessels  but the increase in quantity with both routes in operation drove the price far down  Gradually  Venice s role as a storage and distribution center for spices and silk  dyes cotton  and gold decayed  and by the early seventeenth century Venice had lost its monopoly in markets such as France and southern Germany  
Venetian shipping had started to decline from about 1530 before the entry into the Mediterranean of large volumes of Dutch and British shipping and was clearly outclassed by the end of the century  A contemporary of Shakespeare  1564 1616  observed that the productivity of Italian shipping had declined  compared with that of the British  because of conservatism and loss of expertise  Moreover  Italian sailors were deserting and emigrating  and captains  no longer recruited from the ranks of nobles  were weak on navigations

 Roman shipyards were using all the available fir trees for the warships
 The timber used in the shipbuilding had to be brought from farther and farther away
 Venetian standards required that shipbuilders use top quality materials 



7 All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 and 4 as contributing to the problems of the Venetian shipbuilding industry at the end of the sixteenth century EXCEPT
 The quality of work performed in the Arsenale had declined
 Venetian–built ships were heavy and generally inefficient
 Arsenale shipbuilders worked more slowly
 Only a few merchants controlled the buying and selling of most of the Venetian built ships

10  Why does the author mention  Vasco da Gama s Voyage around southern Africa to India  in the passage 
 to indicate how the Portuguese came to challenge Venetian dominance of trade with the East
 to explain why political troubles resulted in the closing of the usual routes to India
 to prove that Venetians could not sail round ships as efficiently as sailors from other countries did
 to show that Venetian reliance on round ships rather than galleys proved to be weakness



11   Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 6 about the Venetian Council s decision concerning the use of round ships 
 It resulted in a return to profitable in luxury goods for Venetian merchants 
 Ultimately it did not restore the superiority in the spice trade that Venice had enjoyed earlier 
 It eventually enabled Venetian merchants to increase the quantity and price of the spices they sold in Europe 
   It means a long awaited improvement in the fortunes of the shipbuilding industry in Venice 

12   According to paragraphs 6  in the sixteenth century the price of spices declined because 
 France and Germany established monopolies and dictated prices
 Venetian merchant galleys competed with Venetian round ships for the spice trade
 More spices were available because both the Venetians and the Portuguese were importing them
 Increased demand for silk  dyes  cotton and gold meant that people had less money to spend on spices

The loss of power and prestige of Italian cities by the sixteenth century is clearly seen in the decline of Venetian shipping 

 
 
 
Answer choices

 Venetian ships were famous for carrying large cargoes of spices and luxury goods around the world in fast  oar driven galleys 
 A shortage of timber for building the traditional galleys and a lack of sailors to row them meant a loss of Venetian shipping business 
 The Venetian Council made sure that Venetian built and –owned ships kept special privileges in transporting luxury goods in and out of Venice 
 Venetian round ships bringing spices and silk from the East helped drive prices down so that ordinary people could afford to buy them
 Venice failed to keep up with improvement in ship design  and the cost of shipbuilding rose while quality and efficiency declined 
 The Portuguese direct sea route to the East adversely affected Venetian trade  and Venice fell behind the Dutch and the British in the quality of their ships and sailing skills 





 
The Evolutionary Origin of Plants
The evolutionary history of plants has been marked by a series of adaptations  The ancestors of plants were photosynthetic single celled organisms that gave rise to plants presumably lacked true roots  stems  leaves  and complex reproductive structures such as flowers  All of these features appeared later in the evolutionary history of plants  Of today s different groups of algae  green algae are probably the most similar to ancestral plants  This supposition stems from the close phylogenetic  natural evolutionary  relationship between the two groups  DNA comparisons have shown that green algae are plants  closest living relatives  In addition  other lines of evidence support the hypothesis that land plants evolved from ancestral green algae used the same type of chlorophyll and accessory pigments in photosynthesis as do land plants  This would not be true of red and brown algae  Green algae store food as starch  as do land plants and have cell walls made of cellulose  similar in composition to those of land plants  Again  the good storage and cell wall molecules of red and brown algae are different 
Today green algae live mainly in freshwater  suggesting that their early evolutionary history may have occurred in freshwater habitats  If so  the green algae would have been subjected to environmental pressures that resulted in adaptations that enhanced their potential to give rise to land dwelling or organisms 
The environmental conditions of freshwater habitats  unlike those of ocean habitats  are highly variable  Water temperature can fluctuate seasonally or even daily and changing level of rainfall can lead to fluctuations in the concentration of chemical in the water or even to period in which the aquatic habitat dries up  Ancient fresh water green algae must have evolved features that enable them to withstand extremes of temperature and periods of dryness  These adaptations served their descendant well as they invaded land 
The terrestrial world is green now  but it did not start out that way  When plants first made the transition ashore more than 400 million years ago  the land was barren and desolate  inhospitable to life  From a plant s evolutionary view point  however  it was also a land of opportunity  free of competitors and predators and full of carbon dioxide and sunlight  the raw materials for photosynthesis  which are present in far higher concentrations in air than in water  So once natural selection had shaped the adaptations that helped plants overcome the obstacles to terrestrial living  plants prospered and diversified 
When plants pioneered the land  they faced a range of challenges posed by terrestrial environments  On land  the supportive buoyancy of water is missing  the plant is no longer bathed in a nutrient solution  and air tends to dry things out  These conditions favored the evolution of the structures that support the body  vessels that transport water and nutrients to all parts of plant  and structures that conserve water  The resulting adaptations to dry land include some structural features that arose early in plant evolution  now these features are common to virtually all land plant  They include roots or root like structures  a waxy cuticle that covers the surfaces of leaves and stems and limits the evaporation of water  and pores called stomata in leaves and stems that allow gas exchange but close when water is scarce  thus reducing water loss  Other adaptations occurred later in the transition to terrestrial life and now wide spread but not universal among plants  These include conducting vessels that transport water and minerals upward from the roots and that move the photosynthetic products from the leaves to the rest of the plant body and the stiffening substance lignin  which support the plant body  helping it expose maximum surface area to sunlight 
These adaptations allowed an increasing diversity of plant forms to exploit dry land  Life on land  however  also required new methods of transporting sperm to eggs  Unlike aquatic and marine forms  land plants cannot always rely on water currents to carry their sex cells and disperse their fertilized eggs  So the most successful groups of land plants are those that evolved methods of fertilized sex cell dispersal that are independent of water and structures that protest developing embryos from drying out  Protected embryos and waterless dispersal of sex cells were achieved with the origin of seed plants and the key evolutionary innovations that they introduced  pollen  seeds  and later  flowers and fruits

Energy and the Industrial Revolution

For years historians have sought to identify crucial elements in the eighteenth century rise in industry  technology  and economic power known as the Industrial Revolution  and many give prominence to the problem of energy  Until the eighteenth century  people relied on energy derived from plants as well as animal and human muscle to provide power  Increased efficiency in the use of water and wind helped with such tasks as pumping  milling  or sailing  However  by the eighteenth century  Great Britain in particular was experiencing an energy shortage  Wood  the primary source of heat for homes and industries and also used in the iron industry as processed charcoal  was diminishing in supply  Great Britain had large amounts of coal  however  there were not yet efficient means by which to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery  This was to occur with progress in the development of the steam engine  

In the late 1700s James Watt designed an efficient and commercially viable steam engine that was soon applied to a variety of industrial uses as it became cheaper to use  The engine helped solve the problem of draining coal mines of groundwater and increased the production of coal needed to power steam engines elsewhere  A rotary engine attached to the steam engine enabled shafts to be turned and machines to be driven  resulting in mills using steam power to spin and weave cotton  Since the steam engine was fired by coal  the large mills did not need to be located by rivers  as had mills that used water  driven machines  The shift to increased mechanization in cotton production is apparent in the import of raw cotton and the sale of cotton goods  Between 1760 and 1850  the amount of raw cotton imported increased 230 times  Production of British cotton goods increased sixtyfold  and cotton cloth became Great Britain s most important product  accounting for one half of all exports  The success of the steam engine resulted in increased demands for coal  and the consequent increase in coal production was made possible as the steam powered pumps drained water from the ever deeper coal seams found below the water table  

The availability of steam power and the demands for new machines facilitated the transformation of the iron industry  Charcoal  made from wood and thus in limited supply  was replaced with coal derived coke  substance left after coal is heated  as steam driven bellows came into use for producing of raw iron  Impurities were burnt away with the use of coke  producing a high quality refined iron  Reduced cost was also instrumental in developing steam powered rolling mills capable of producing finished iron of various shapes and sizes  The resulting boom in the iron industry expanded the annual iron output by more than 170 times between 1740 and 1840  and by the 1850s Great Britain was producing more tons of iron than the rest of the world combined  The developments in the iron industry were in part a response to the demand for more machines and the ever widening use of higher quality iron in other industries  

Steam power and iron combined to revolutionize transport  which in turn had further implications  Improvements in road construction and sailing had occurred  but shipping heavy freight over land remained expensive  even with the use of rivers and canals wherever possible  Parallel rails had long been used in mining operations to move bigger loads  but horses were still the primary source of power  However  the arrival of the steam engine initiated a complete transformation in rail transportation  entrenching and expanding the Industrial Revolution  As transportation improved  distant and larger markets within the nation could be reached  thereby encouraging the development of larger factories to keep pace with increasing sales  Greater productivity and rising demands provided entrepreneurs with profits that could be reinvested to take advantage of new technologies to further expand capacity  or to seek alternative investment opportunities  Also  the availability of jobs in railway construction attracted many rural laborers accustomed to seasonal and temporary employment  When the work was completed  many moved to other construction jobs or to factory work in cities and towns  where they became part of an expanding working class

  Water and wind could not be used efficiently 
  There was no efficient way to power machinery 
  Steam engines required large amounts of coal  which was in short supply 
  Neither humans nor animals were strong enough to provide the power required for industrial application

  It demonstrates why developments in a single industry could not have caused the Industrial Revolution 
  It illustrates why historians have assigned great importance to the issue of energy in the rise of the Industrial Revolution 


8  According to paragraph 3  why was the use of coke important for the iron industry 
  It helped make wood into charcoal 
  It reduced the dependency on steam powered machines used for the production of iron  
  It replaced charcoal in the production of raw and refined iron

Answer Choices

  For years  historians disregarded the issue of energy as a major element in the rise of the Industrial Revolution and focused instead on technological developments and increased production 
  The introduction and growth of steam powered rail transport was a major factor in Britain s economic expansion during the Industrial Revolution 
  An expansion of the Industrial Revolution outside Great Britain occurred when British industries began to import raw cotton and high quality iron 
  By 1850  the use of steam power in Britain s mills  mines  and iron industry made Britain a world leader in the production of cotton cloth and iron 
  Since the basic infrastructure was in place  the Industrial Revolution fueled itself with enlarging markets requiring ever more expansion of factories and workforce 
  By the end of the 1800s  railway construction attracted so many laborers that factories could not find enough workers to keep up with increasing sales 



 
Survival of Plants and Animals in Desert Conditions
The harsh conditions in deserts are intolerable for most plants and animals  Despite these conditions  however  many varieties of plants and animals have adapted to deserts in a number of ways  Most plant tissues die if their water content falls too low  the nutrients that feed plants are transmitted by water  water is a raw material in the vital process of photosynthesis  and water regulates the temperature of a plant by its ability to absorb heat and because water vapor lost to the atmosphere through the leaves helps to lower plant temperatures  Water controls the volume of plant matter produced  The distribution of plants within different areas of desert is also controlled by water  Some areas  because of their soil texture  topographical position  or distance from rivers or groundwater  have virtually no water available to plants  whereas others do 

The nature of plant life in deserts is also highly dependent on the fact that they have to adapt to the prevailing aridity  There are two general classes of vegetation  long lived perennials  which may be succulent  water storing  and are often dwarfed and woody  and annuals or ephemerals  which have a short life cycle and may form a fairly dense stand immediately after rain 

The ephemeral plants evade drought  Given a year of favorable precipitation  such plants will develop vigorously and produce large numbers of flowers and fruit  This replenishes the seed content of the desert soil  The seeds then lie dormant until the next wet year  when the desert blooms again 

The perennial vegetation adjusts to the aridity by means of various avoidance mechanisms  Most desert plants are probably best classified as xerophytes  They possess drought resisting adaptations  loss of water through the leaves is reduced by means of dense hairs covering waxy leaf surfaces  by the closure of pores during the hottest times to reduce water loss  and by the rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of the dry season  Some xerophytes  the succulents  including cacti   store water in their structures  Another way of countering drought is to have a limited amount of mass above ground and to have extensive root networks below ground  It is not unusual for the roots of some desert perennials to extend downward more than ten meters  Some plants are woody in type  an adaptation designed to prevent collapse of the plant tissue when water stress produces wilting  Another class of desert plant is the phreatophyte  These have adapted to the environment by the development of long taproots that penetrate downward until they approach the assured water supply provided by groundwater  Among these plants are the date palm  tamarisk  and mesquite  They commonly grow near stream channels  springs  or on the margins of lakes 

Animals also have to adapt to desert conditions  and they may do it through two forms of behavioral adaptation  they either escape or retreat  Escape involves such actions as aestivation  a condition of prolonged dormancy  or torpor  during which animals reduce their metabolic rate and body temperature during the hot season or during very dry spells 

Seasonal migration is another form of escape  especially for large mammals or birds  The term retreat is applied to the short term escape behavior of desert animals  and it usually assumes the pattern of a daily rhythm  Birds shelter in nests  rock overhangs  trees  and dense shrubs to avoid the hottest hours of the day  while mammals like the kangaroo rat burrow underground 
Some animals have behavioral  physiological  and morphological  structural  adaptations that enable them to withstand extreme conditions  For example  the ostrich has plumage that is so constructed that the feathers are long but not too dense  When conditions are hot  the ostrich erects them on its back  thus increasing the thickness of the barrier between solar radiation and the skin  The sparse distribution of the feathers  however  also allows considerable lateral air movement over the skin surface  thereby permitting further heat loss by convection  Furthermore  the birds orient themselves carefully with regard to the Sun and gently flap their wings to increase convection cooling 

1  According to paragraph 1  water provides all of the following essential functions for plants EXCEPT 
  improving plants  ability to absorb sunlight 
  preventing plants from becoming overheated 
  transporting nutrients
  serving as a raw material for photosynthesis



2  Paragraph 3 suggests that during a dry year ephemerals 
  produce even more seeds than in a wet year 
  do not sprout from their seeds 
  bloom much later than in a wet year 
  are more plentiful than perennials

3  How is paragraph 2 related to paragraph 3  
  Paragraph 2 provides a general description of desert plants  and paragraph 3 provides a scientific explanation for these observations 
  Paragraph 2 divides desert plants into two categories  and paragraph 3 provides further information about one of these categories 
  Paragraph 2 proposes one way of dividing desert plants into categories  and paragraph 3 explains one problem with this method of classification 
  Paragraph 2 discusses two categories of desert plants  and paragraph 3 introduces a third category of plants 

4  In saying that ephemerals will develop  vigorously  when there is favorable precipitation  the author means that their development will be 
  sudden
  early
  gradual
  strong and healthy

5  The word  countering  in the passage is closest in meaning to

6  According to paragraph 4  some desert plants with root systems that are extraordinarily well developed have 
  relatively little growth aboveground 
  very leafy aboveground structures 
  non woody plant tissue resistant to wilting 
  water stored within their roots

7  The word  assured  in the passage is closest in meaning to  
  pure 
  diminished 
  guaranteed 
  deep

    8  What do  the date palm  tamarisk  and mesquite  have in common  
  They are always found together 
  They depend on surface water provided by streams  springs  and lakes  
  They are phreatophytes 
  Their roots are capable of breaking through hard soils




9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information  
  One way animals escape is by entering a state of extended dormancy  known as aestivation  during the hottest and driest times of year 
  Animals can escape without using direct action  or aestivation  simply by reducing their metabolic rate and body temperature 
  The actions that an animal uses to escape are known as aestivation  which sometimes involves a reduction in metabolic rate or body temperature 
  When the weather is especially hot and dry  an animal may suffer from a condition known as aestivation  at which point the animal needs to escape 




   10  It can be inferred from paragraph 6 that all of the places desert animals retreat to  
  provide shade from the sun 
  sometimes become crowded 
  are places where supplies of food are plentiful 
  leave the animals vulnerable to predators


11  According to paragraph 7  what special adaptation helps the ostrich cope with hot desert conditions  
  Each of its feathers is very short and dense 
  Its wings produce only lateral air movement when flapping 
 Its feathers are very thickly set on both its back and its wings 
  It can make its feathers stand up on its back

Sumer and the First Cities of the Ancient near East

The earliest of the city states of the ancient Near East appeared at the southern end of the Mesopotamian plain  the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq  It was here that the civilization known as Sumer emerged in its earliest form in the fifth millennium  At first sight  the plain did not appear to be a likely home for a civilization  There were few natural resources  no timber  stone  or metals  Rainfall was limited  and what water there was rushed across the plain in the annual flood of melted snow  As the plain fell only 20 meters in 500 kilometers  the beds of the rivers shifted constantly  It was this that made the organization of irrigation  particularly the building of canals to channel and preserve the water  essential  Once this was done and the silt carried down by the rivers was planted  the rewards were rich  four to five times what rain fed earth would produce  It was these conditions that allowed an elite to emerge  probably as an organizing class  and to sustain itself through the control of surplus crops 

It is difficult to isolate the factors that led to the next development the emergence of urban settlements  The earliest  that of Eridu  about 4500 B C E   and Uruk  a thousand years later  center on impressive temple complexes built of mud brick  In some way  the elite had associated themselves with the power of the gods  Uruk  for instance  had two patron gods Anu  the god of the sky and sovereign of all other gods  and Inanna  a goddess of love and war and there were others  patrons of different cities  Human beings were at their mercy  The biblical story of the Flood may originate in Sumer  In the earliest version  the gods destroy the human race because its clamor had been so disturbing to them 

It used to be believed that before 3000 B C E  the political and economic life of the cities was centered on their temples  but it now seems probable that the cities had secular rulers from earliest times  Within the city lived administrators  craftspeople  and merchants   Trading was important  as so many raw materials  the semiprecious stones for the decoration of the temples  timbers for roofs  and all metals  had to be imported   An increasingly sophisticated system of administration led in about 3300 B C E  to the appearance of writing  The earliest script was based on logograms  with a symbol being used to express a whole word  The logograms were incised on damp clay tablets with a stylus with a wedge shape at its end   The Romans called the shape cuneus and this gives the script its name of cuneiform   Two thousand logograms have been recorded from these early centuries of writing  A more economical approach was to use a sign to express not a whole word but a single syllable   To take an example  the Sumerian word for  head  was  sag   Whenever a word including a syllable in which the sound  sag  was to be written  the sign for  sag  could be used to express that syllable with the remaining syllables of the word expressed by other signs   By 2300 B C E  the number of signs required had been reduced to 600  and the range of words that could be expressed had widened  Texts dealing with economic matters predominated  as they always had done  but at this point works of theology  literature  history  and law also appeared 

Other innovations of the late fourth millennium include the wheel  probably developed first as a more efficient way of making pottery and then transferred to transport  A tablet engraved about 3000 B C E  provides the earliest known example from Sumer  a roofed boxlike sledge mounted on four solid wheels  A major development was the discovery  again about 3000 B C E   that if copper  which had been known in Mesopotamia since about 3500 B C E   was mixed with tin  a much harder metal  bronze  would result  Although copper and stone tools continued to be used  bronze was far more successful in creating sharp edges that could be used as anything from saws and scythes to weapons  The period from 3000 to 1000 B C E   when the use of bronze became widespread  is normally referred to as the Bronze Age

Crafts in the Ancient near East

Some of the earliest human civilizations arose in southern Mesopotamia  in what is now southern Iraq  in the fourth millennium B C E  In the second half of the millennium  in the south around the city of Uruk  there was an enormous escalation in the area occupied by permanent settlements  A large part of that increase took place in Uruk itself  which became a real urban center surrounded by a set of secondary settlements  While population estimates are notoriously unreliable  scholars assume that Uruk inhabitants were able to support themselves from the agricultural production of the field surrounding the city  which could be reached with a daily commute  But Uruk s dominant size in the entire region  far surpassing that of other settlements  indicates that it was a regional center and a true city  Indeed  it was the first city in human history 

The vast majority of its population remained active in agriculture  even those people living within the city itself  But a small segment of the urban society started to specialize in nonagricultural tasks as a result of the city s role as a regional center  Within the productive sector  there was a growth of a variety of specialist craftspeople  Early in the Uruk period  the use of undecorated utilitarian pottery was probably the result of specialized mass production  In an early fourth millennium level of the Eanna archaeological site at Uruk  a pottery style appears that is most characteristic of this process  the so called beveled rim bowl  It is a rather shallow bowl that was crudely made in a mold  hence  in only a limited number of standard sizes  For some unknown reason  many were discarded  often still intact  and thousands have been found all over the Near East  The beveled rim bowl is one of the most telling diagnostic finds for identifying an Uruk period site  Of importance is the fact that it was produced rapidly in large amounts  most likely by specialists in a central location 

A variety of documentation indicates that certain goods  once made by a family member as one of many duties  were later made by skilled artisans  Certain images depict groups of people  most likely women  involved in weaving textiles  an activity we know from later third millennium texts to have been vital in the economy and to have been centrally administered  Also  a specialized metal producing workshop may have been excavated in a small area at Uruk  It contained a number of channels lined by a sequence of holes  about 50 centimeters deep  all showing burn marks and filled with ashes  This has been interpreted as the remains of a workshop where molten metal was scooped up from the channel and poured into molds in the holes  Some type of mass production by specialists were involved here 

Objects themselves suggest that they were the work of skilled professionals  In the late Uruk period  3500 3100 B C E    there first appeared a type of object that remained characteristic for Mesopotamia throughout its entire history  the cylinder seal  This was a small cylinder  usually no more than 3 centimeters high and 2 centimeters in diameter  of shell  bone  faience  a glassy type of stoneware   or various types of stones  on which a scene was carved into the surface  When rolled over a soft material    primarily the clay of bullae  round seals   tablets  or clay lumps attached to boxes  jars  or door bolts    the scene would appear in relief  easily legible  The technological knowledge needed to carve it was far superior to that for stamp seals  which had happened in the early Neolithic period  approximately 10 000 5000 B C E    From the first appearance of cylinder seals  the carved scenes could be highly elaborate and refined  indicating the work of specialist stone cutters  Similarly  the late Uruk period shows the first monumental art  relief  and statuary in the round  made with a degree of mastery that only a professional could have produced 






1  Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
 Although scholars cannot accurately determine the size of the Uruk population  they know the citizens were not dependent on agriculture 
 scholars do not have enough evidence to determine whether the agriculture areas just outside of Uruk were large enough to feed the city s population 
 Because city populations cannot feed themselves  scholars think the surrounding farms provided food to the people in Uruk 
 Scholars believe that the inhabitants of Uruk were able to support themselves from product grown in field surrounding the city

Uruk  located in ancient Mesopotamia  flourished in the fourth millennium B C E  and was the first city in human history 
 
 
 


Answer Choices

 A variety of evidence indicates that Uruk  while it supported itself primarily by agriculture  also had specialized craft workers 
 The monumental sculptures of Uruk were made by the specialist stone cutters who also produced small scale relief scenes on shell  bone and faience 
 The large number  standardized sizes  and simple molded construction of a type of pottery produced in Uruk demonstrate specialized  centrally organized mass production 
 Cylinder seals from the late Uruk period are far superior to the stamp earlier Neolithic period 
 Archaeological evidence from across the Near East indicates that Uruk was a center for the production and export of highly decorated pottery made by craft specialists in private homes 
 The carved designs on cylinder seals produced in Uruk are of such technical and artistic excellence that they could only have been produced by professional artisans 

















 
The Formation of Volcanic Islands

Earth s surface is not made up of a single sheet of rock that forms a crust but rather a number of  tectonic plates  that fit closely  like the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle  Some plates carry islands or continents others form the seafloor  All are slowly moving because the plates float on a denser semi liquid mantle  the layer between the crust and Earth s core  The plates have edges that are spreading ridges  where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created   subduction zones  where two plates collide and one plunges beneath the other   or transform faults  where two plates neither converge nor diverge but merely move past one another   It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth s volcanism and earthquake activity occur 

Generally speaking  the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful  However  there are exceptions  A glance at a map of the Pacific Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes    many no longer active  some overgrown with coral    that originated from activity at points in the interior of the Pacific Plate that forms the Pacific seafloor 

How can volcanic activity occur so far from a plate boundary  The Hawaiian Islands provide a very instructive answer  Like many other island groups  they form a chain  The Hawaiian Islands Chain extends northwest from the island of Hawaii  In the 1840s American geologist James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands seem to share a similar geologic evolution but are progressively more eroded  and therefore probable older  toward the northwest  Then in 1963  in the early days of the development of the theory of plate tectonics  Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface plate moving over a fixed volcanic source in the interior  Wilson suggested that the long chain of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is simply the surface expression of a long lived volcanic source located beneath the tectonic plate in the mantle  Today s most northwest island would have been the first to form  Then as the plate moved slowly northwest  new volcanic islands would have forms as the plate moved over the volcanic source  The most recent island  Hawaii  would be at the end of the chain and is now over the volcanic source 

Although this idea was not immediately accepted  the dating of lavas in the Hawaii  and other  chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano  just as Daly had suggested  Wilson s analysis of these data is now a central part of plate tectonics  Most volcanoes that occur in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by mantle plumes  columns of molten rock that rise from deep within the mantle  A volcano remains an active  hot spot  as long as it is over the plume  The plumes apparently originate at great depths  perhaps as deep as the boundary between the core and the mantle  and many have been active for a very long time  The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot spot trail have ages close to 80 million years  Other islands  including Tahiti and Easter Islands in the pacific  Reunion and Mauritius in the India Ocean  and indeed most of the large islands in the world s oceans  owe their existence to mantle plumes  

The oceanic volcanic islands and their hot spot trails are thus especially useful for geologist because they record the past locations of the plate over a fixed source  They therefore permit the reconstruction of the process of seafloor spreading  and consequently of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past  For example  given the current position of the Pacific Plate  Hawaii is above the Pacific Ocean hot spot  So the position of The Pacific Plate 50 million years ago can be determined by moving it such that a 50 million year old volcano in the hot spot trail sits at the location of Hawaii today  However because the ocean basins really are short lived features on geologic times scale  reconstruction the world s geography by backtracking along the hot spot trail works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time

Although volcanic activity is concentrated on the edge of tectonic plates  such activity can occur in the interiors of plates as well 

 
 
 


Answer Choices

 Our understanding of islands comes from Daly s and Wilson s observations of the Hawaiian Islands  which was later confirmed by plate tectonic theory 
 The hot spot trails formed by volcanic island chains indicate the positions of tectonic plates as far back as the present ocean basins have existed 
 Whereas volcanic islands formed by mantle plumes are typically small  most of the world s largest islands are formed at the edges of tectonic plates 
 It has only recently been discovered that tectonic plates are closely fitting rather than loosely constructed  as geologist previously believed 
 Volcanic island chains such as the Hawaiian Islands form in the interior of a tectonic plate as the plate moves over a fixed volcanic source in the mantle 
 The Pacific Plate has existed for as long as the Hawaiian Islands have existed  namely for more than 80 million years 
 
Predator Prey Cycles
How do predators affect populations of the prey animals  The answer is not as simple as might be thought  Moose reached Isle Royale in Lake Superior by crossing over winter ice and multiplied freely there in isolation without predators  When wolves later reached the island  naturalists widely assumed that the wolves would play a key role in controlling the moose population  Careful studies have demonstrated  however  that this is not the case  The wolves eat mostly old or diseased animals that would not survive long anyway  In general  the moose population is controlled by food availability  disease and other factors rather than by wolves  

When experimental populations are set up under simple laboratory conditions  the predator often exterminates its pre and then becomes extinct itself  having nothing left to eat  However  if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided  the prey population drops to low level but not extinction  Low prey population levels then provide inadequate food for the predators  causing the predator population to decrease  When this occurs  the prey population can rebound  In this situation the predator and prey population may continue in this cyclical pattern for some time 

Population cycles are characteristic of small mammals  and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators  Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snow shoe hare follows a roughly ten year cycle  Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a typical cycle  and a hundredfold change can occur  Two factors appear to be generating the cycle  food plants and predators 

The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are willow and birch twigs  As hare density increases  the quantity of these twigs decreases  forcing the hares to feed on low quality high fiber food  Lower birth rates  low juvenile survivorship  and low growth rates follow  so there is a corresponding decline in hare abundance  Once the hare population has declined  it takes two to three year for the quantity of twigs to recover  

A key predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx  The Canada lynx shows a ten year cycle of abundance that parallels the abundance cycle of hares  As hare numbers fall  so do lynx numbers  as their food supply depleted 

What causes the predator prey oscillations  Do increasing number of hares lead to overharvesting of plants  which in turn results in reduced hare populations  or do increasing numbers of lynx lead to overharvesting hares  Field experiments carried out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992 provide an answer  Krebs investigated experimental plots in Canada s Yukon territory that contained hare populations  When food was added to those plots  no food effect  and predators were excluded  no predator effect  from an experimental area  hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed there the cycle was lost  However  the cycle was retained if either of the factors was allowed to operate alone  if predators were excluded but food was not added  food effect alone   or if food was added in the presence of predators  predator effect alone   Thus both factors can affect the cycle  which  in practice  seems to be generated by conjunction of the two factors 

Predators are an essential factor in maintaining communities that are rich and diverse in species  Without predators  the species that is the best competitor for food  shelter  nesting sites  and other environmental resources tends to dominate and exclude the species with which it competes  This phenomenon is known as  competitor exclusion   However  if the community contains a predator of the strongest competitor species  then the population of that competitor is controlled  Thus even the less competitive species are able to survive  For example  sea stars prey on a variety of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor  This opens up space for many other organisms  When sea stars are removed  species diversity falls sharply  Therefore  from the stand point of diversity  it is usually a mistake to eliminate a major predator from a community 



1  In paragraph 1  why does the author discuss the moose and wolves on Isle Royal 
 To provide an example of predators moving to new habitats by following migrating prey
 To show that the interactions between predator populations and prey populations are not always might be expected
 To suggest that prey populations are more influenced by predation than food availability and disease
 To argue that studies of geographically isolated populations tend not to be useful to naturalists


2  The word  rebound  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  escape
  recover
  survive
  resist

3  Paragraph 2 implies which of the following about experimental environments in which predators become extinct 
  They may yield results that do not accurate predict changes of populations in the wild 
  In these environments  the prey species is better adapted than the predator species 
  These environments are appropriate only for studying small populations of predators and prey 
  They are unrealistic because some predators are also the prey of other predators 

4  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about the small mammals that experience population cycles 
  Their population cycles are not affected by predators 
  Their predators  populations periodically disappear 
  They typically undergo ten year cycles 
  They have access to places safe from predators

7  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are true of the food of snowshoe hares EXCEPT
  The preferred food fore hares consists of willow and birch twigs 
  High fiber food is the most nutritious for hares 
  Depletion of the supply of willow and birch twigs cause low birth and growth rates 
  The food supply takes two or three years to recover after a peak in hare population density 

8  The word  conjunction  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  determination
  combination

9  According to paragraph 5  which of the following statements best characterizes the abundance cycle of the Canada lynx 
  It closely follows the cycle the snowshoe hare 
  When the numbers of lynx fall  the numbers of snowshoe hares soon decrease 
  When hare numbers decrease  lynx numbers increase 
  It is not clearly related to the availability of lynx food 
10  According to paragraph 6  which of the following was true of the hare population cycle in Krebs s experiment 
  The effects of providing food while at the same time introducing predators cancelled each other  so there was no cycle 
  The cycle existed when either the food supply was limited or there were predators 
  There was a cycle when there were no predators and food was supplied 
  If the hares had places to hide from the lynx  the hare population increased tenfold and then remained at that level 
11  According to paragraph 7  which of the following statements correctly characterizes the effect of sea stars on the ecosystem in which they are predators of bivalves 
  Bivalve population are kept low  allowing species that compete with bivalves to survive 
  The numbers of most species of bivalves are greatly reduced  leaving the bivalve species that is the strongest competitor to dominate among the survivors 
  Biological diversity begins to decrease because many bivalve species disappear 
  Sea stars dominate at first but then die off because of the depleted food supply 
12  According to paragraph 7  which of the following is true of the phenomenon of competitor exclusion 
  It results in more diverse communities 
  It requires the presence of predators 
  It affects all competitions equally 
  It happens only when there is a dominant competitor

The relationships between predators and prey are complex 
 
 
 
Answer Choices

  Studies of the interactions between wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior reveal that wolf predation is not the primary factor controlling the moose population 
  Predators help maintain biological diversity by limiting populations of a dominant competitor species  thereby preventing that species from excluding others 
  A species  population tends to rise and falls in a cycle pattern if the food supply for the population is limited  or if the population has a major predator 
  Ecologists are interested in studying predator prey population cycles because understanding how predators and prey interact will allow better wildlife management programs 
  In predator prey population cycles  predator populations increase or decrease following similar population changes in the species they prey on 
  The removal of sea stars reduces the diversity of the community in which they are predators  and is therefore a bad idea

Groundwater

Most of the world s potable water    freshwater suitable for drinking    is accounted for by groundwater  which is stored in the pores and fractures in rocks  There is more than 50 times as much freshwater stored underground than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface  Nearly 50 percent of all groundwater is stored in the upper 1 000 meters of Earth  At greater depths within Earth  the pressure of the overlying rock causes pores and cracks to close  reducing the space that pore water can occupy  and almost complete closure occurs at a depth of about 10 kilometers  The greatest water storage  therefore  lies near the surface  
Aquifers  Porosity and Permeability
Groundwater is stored in a variety of rock types  A groundwater reservoir from which water can be extracted is called an aquifer  We can effectively think of an aquifer as a deposit of water  Extraction of water depends on two properties of the aquifer  porosity and permeability  Between sediment grains are spaces that can be filled with water  This pore space is known as porosity and is expressed as a percentage of the total rock volume  Porosity is important for water storage capacity  but for water to flow through rocks  the pore spaces must be connected  The ability of water  or other fluids  to flow through the interconnected pore spaces in rocks is termed permeability  In the intergranular spaces of rocks  however  fluid must flow around and between grains in a tortuous path  this winding path causes a resistance to flow  The rate at which the flowing water overcomes this resistance is related to the permeability of rock  
Sediment sorting and compaction influence permeability and porosity  The more poorly sorted or the more tightly compacted a sediment is  the lower its porosity and permeability  Sedimentary rocks    the most common rock type near the surface    are also the most common reservoirs for water because they contain the most space that can be filled with water  Sandstones generally make good aquifers  while finer grained mudstones are typically impermeable  Impermeable rocks are referred to as aquicludes  Igneous and metamorphic rocks are more compact  commonly crystalline  and rarely contain spaces between grains  However  even igneous and metamorphic rocks may act as groundwater reservoirs if extensive fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the fracture system is interconnected 
The Water Table
The water table is the underground boundary below which all the cracks and pores are filled with water  In some cases  the water table reaches Earth s surface  where it is expressed as rivers  lakes and marshes  Typically  though  the water table may be tens or hundreds of meters below the surface  The water table is not flat but usually follows the contours of the topography  Above the water table is the vadose zone  through which rainwater percolates  Water in the vadose zone drains down to the water table  leaving behind a thin coating of water on mineral grains  The vadose zone supplies plant roots near the surface with water 
Because the surface of the water table is not flat but instead rises and falls with topography  groundwater is affected by gravity in the same fashion as surface water  Groundwater flows downhill to topographic lows  If the water table intersect the land surface  groundwater will flow out onto the surface at springs  whether to be collected there or to subsequently flow farther along a drainage  Groundwater commonly collects in stream drainages but may remain entirely beneath the surface of dry stream beds in arid regions  In particularly wet years  short stretches of an otherwise dry stream bed may have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface

Answer Choices

  Sedimentary rock may make poor aquifers because of tightly compacted sediment  which reduces porosity and permeability 
  Porosity is a measure of the empty space within rock while permeability measures the degree to which water can flow freely through rock 
  In arid regions  the water tables remain at a constant level far below the surface  preventing stream beds from filling up even during wet years 
  Groundwater reservoirs are characterized by the porosity and permeability of the rock in which they lie  and these factors vary according to the type of rock 
  The vadose zone is typically dry because water does not stay in it  but instead percolates down to aquifers below or drains out through springs and streams 
  Although the water table usually follows the contours of the land surface  its level may vary from year to year and may intersect to the surface in places 



 
Early Saharan Pastoralists

The Sahara is a highly diverse  albeit dry  region that has undergone major climatic changes since 10 000 B C  As recently as 6 000 B C  the southern frontier of the desert was far to the north of where it is now  while semiarid grassland and shallow freshwater lakes covered much of what are now arid plains  This was a landscape where antelope of all kinds abounded    along with Bos primigenius  a kind of oxen that has become extinct  The areas that are now desert were  like all arid regions  very susceptible to cycles of higher and lower levels of rainfall  resulting in major  sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals  The people who hunted the sparse desert animals responded to drought by managing the wild resources they hunted and gathered  especially wild oxen  which had to have regular water supplies to survive 
Even before the drought  the Sahara was never well watered  Both humans and animals were constantly on the move  in search of food and reliable water supplies  Under these circumstances  archaeologist Andrew Smith believes  the small herds of Bos primigenius in the desert became smaller  more closely knit breeding units as the drought took hold  The beasts were more disciplined  so that it was easier for hunters to predict their habits  and capture animals at will  At the same time  both cattle and humans were more confined in their movements  staying much closer to permanent water supplies for long periods of time  As a result  cattle and humans came into close association 
Smith believes that the hunters were well aware of the more disciplined ways in which their prey behaved  Instead of following the cattle on their annual migrations  the hunters began to prevent the herd from moving from one spot to another  At first  they controlled the movement of the herd while ensuring continuance of their meat diet  But soon they also gained genetic control of the animals  which led to rapid physical changes in the herd  South African farmers who maintain herds of wild eland  large African antelopes with short  twisted horns  report that the offspring soon diminish in size  unless wild bulls are introduced constantly from outside  The same effects of inbreeding may have occurred in controlled cattle populations  with some additional  and perhaps unrecognized  advantages  The newly domesticated animals behaved better  were easier to control  and may have enjoyed a higher birth rate  which in turn yielded greater milk supplies  We know from rock paintings deep in the Sahara that the herders were soon selecting breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors 
It is still unclear whether domesticated cattle were tamed independently in northern Africa or introduced to the continent from southwest Asia  Whatever the source of the original tamed herds might have been  it seems entirely likely that much the same process of juxtaposition  living side by side  and control occurred in both southwest Asia and northern Africa  and even in Europe  among peoples who had an intimate knowledge of the behavior of wild cattle  The experiments with domestication probably occurred in many places  as people living in ever drier environments cast around for more predictable food supplies 
The cattle herders had only a few possessions  unsophisticated pots and polished adzes  They also hunted with bow and arrow  The Saharan people left a remarkable record of their lives painted on the walls of caves deep in the desert  Their artistic endeavors have been preserved in paintings of wild animals  cattle  goats  humans  and scenes of daily life that extend back perhaps to 5 000 B C   The widespread distribution of pastoral sites of this period suggests that the Saharans ranged their herds over widely separated summer and winter grazing grounds 
About 3 500 B C   climatic conditions again deteriorated  The Sahara slowly became drier and lakes vanished  On the other hand  rainfall increased in the interior of western Africa  and the northern limit of the tsetse fly  an insect fatal to cattle  moved south  So the herders shifted south  following the major river systems into savanna regions  By this time  the Saharan people were probably using domestic crops  experimenting with such summer rainfall crops as sorghum and millet as they move out of areas where they could grow wheat  barley  and other Mediterranean crops

1  According to paragraph 1  what was true of the Sahara region around 6 000 B C  
  Much less of it was desert than is now the case 
  Most areas that are now grassland were covered by shallow lakes 
  It had just undergone a major climatic change

  They include at least some freshwater lakes 
  They have similar distributions of plants and animals 
  They are greatly affected by changes in the amount of rain they receive 
  They have frequent droughts that make it difficult to manage the wild resources 


4  Paragraph 2 supports which of the following ideas about wild oxen in the Sahara region after the drought took hold 
  They traveled in smaller herds 
  They were harder for hunters to capture 
  They tended to be significantly smaller in size 
  They moved along less predictable routes 

5  According to paragraph 2  what was it that brought cattle and humans into close association 
  The development of smaller breeding units within herds 
  Cattle and humans staying close to permanent water supplies for long period of time 
  The development of greater discipline among cattle 
  Cattle and humans constantly on the move searching for food and reliable water supplies 


6  Why does the author mention the  rock paintings deep in the Sahara  
  To help explain why the hunters wanted to control the herds 
  To provide support for the idea that the herders soon gained genetic control of the cattle
  To show that the herders had artistic as well as practical abilities
  To argue that the herders soon began to value their cattle for more than food 

7  According to paragraph 3  all of the following statements were true of newly domesticated animals EXCEPT
  They were controlled more easily by the farmers 
  They produced a larger number of offspring 
  They produce more milk 
  They were larger in size 


8   which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
  Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from  people tried to control them by living in juxtaposition with them 
  Regardless of where the first tamed herds came from  they resulted from the same process of juxtaposition and control by people who understood the behavior of wild cattle 
  People who had an intimate knowledge of the behavior of wild cattle moved closer together to cooperate in taming the herd  regardless of where they found them 
  The process of taming herds was certainly the same in southwest Asia  northern Africa  and Europe because people knew a lot about the behavior of wild cattle  regardless of where they lived 






9  According to paragraph 5  each of the following was true about the early Saharan people EXCEPT
  They had few possessions apart from cattle 
  After about 5 000 B C   they lived primarily in caves that were located deep in the desert 
  Between the summer and winter seasons  they moved their herds over long distances

  They could easily grow Mediterranean crops in those regions 
  They could more easily domesticated sorghum and millet in those regions 
  The tsetse fly was no longer a problem in those regions 
  The river systems in those regions provided reliable sources of water in the summer

Answer Choices

  There was enough freshwater for Saharan peoples to move freely throughout the region without having to manage the resources they hunted and gathered 
  Once Saharans controlled the breeding of their cattle  the characteristics of the cattle changed rapidly  increasing their reproductive rate and milk production 
  Although the Saharan peoples were remarkably sophisticated artists  they had only a few simple possessions  like adzes and the bows and arrows they used for hunting 
  When the drying climate forced cattle and humans close to each other in areas with water supplies  humans gained control over the cattle and eventually domesticated them 
  Herders soon began selecting breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors  although the advantage of controlled inbreeding were not apparent to them at first 
  As the drought worsened around 3 500 B C  and conditions for herders became more favorable to the south  the Saharan people moved into savanna regions  where they grew different crops 









 
Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes

A conspicuous sign indicating the presence of white tailed deer in a woodlot is a buck rub  A male deer makes a buck rub by striping the bark  outer layer  of a small tree with its antlers  When completed  the buck rub is an obvious visual signal to us and presumable to other deer in the area  A rub is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer  one meter or less above the ground  on a smooth barked  small diameter  16 25 millimeters  tree  The smooth bark of small red maples makes this species ideal for buck rubs in the forests of the mid eastern United States 

Adult male deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outer velvet layer is being shed from their antlers  Rubs are created about one to two months before the breeding season  the rut   Hence for a long time biologists believed that male deer used buck rubs not only to clean and polish antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male to male combat during the rut  However  biologists also noted deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar rub  which suggests that this visual mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer 

Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the rub is made  These odors make buck rubs an important means of olfactory communication between deer  The importance of olfactory communication  using odors to communicate  in the way of life of deer was documented by a study of captive adult male deer a few decades ago  which noted that males rubbed their foreheads on branches and twigs  especially as autumn approached  A decade later another study reported that adult male white tailed deer exhibited forehead rubbing just before and during the rut  It was found that when a white tailed buck makes a rub  it moves both antlers and forehead glands along the small tree in a vertical direction  This forehead rubbing behavior coincides with a high level of glandular activity in the modified scent glands found on the foreheads of male deer  the glandular activity causes the forehead pelage  hairy covering  of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males 

Forehead rubbing by male deer on buck rubs presumably sends a great deal of information to other members of the same species  First  the chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal  no two mammals produce the same scent  For instance  as we all know  dogs recognize each other via smell  Second  because only male deer rub  the buck rub and its associated chemicals indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub  Third  older  more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and probably deposit more glandular secretions on a given rub  Thus the presence of many well marked rubs is indicative of older  higher status males being in the general vicinity rather than simply being a crude measure of relative deer abundance in a given area  The information conveyed by the olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer species  such as trumpeting by bull elk  

Because both sexes of white tailed respond to buck rubs by smelling and licking them  rubs may serve a very important additional function  Fresher buck rubs  less than two days old   in particular  are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs  In view of this behavior it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help physiologically induce and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs  This would be an obvious advantage to wide ranging deer  especially to a socially dominant buck when courting several adult females during the autumn rut  Another visual signal produced by while tailed deer is termed a buck scrape  Scrapes consist of a clearing  about 0 5 meter in diameter  and shallow depression made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground  after making the scrape  the deer typically urinates in the depression  Thus  like a buck rub  a scrape is both a visual and an olfactory signal  Buck scrapes are generally created after leaf fall in autumn  which is just before or during the rut  Scrapes are usually placed in open or conspicuous places  such as along a deer trail  Most are made by older males  although females and younger males  2 5 years old or less  occasionally make scrapes

  They are found in the mid eastern United States 
  They grow very slowly 
  They tend to grow in open spaces 


3  The studies of forehead rubbing by deer described in paragraph 3 showed that
  forehead rubbing encourages the growth of antlers

  rough
  useful
  necessary
  obvious

7  What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about the trumpeting of bull elk 
  Trumpeting by higher status bull elk signals their presence to other members of their species 
  Bull elk need to combine trumpeting with olfactory signals to convey information about their identity 
  Trumpeting alerts white tailed deer to the presence of bull elk in their vicinity 
  Trumpeting provides a better measure of deer presence in a given area than buck rubs do 

8  According to paragraph 4  the buck rubs occurring in a given area reveal all of the following information about deer EXCEPT
  the individual identity of the deer
  the gender of the deer
  the likely social status of the deer
  the number of deer in the vicinity

Answer Choices

  The observation that deer sniff and lick buck rubs first led scientists to connect buck rubs with combat between adult males during the breeding season 
  Buck rubs and buck scrapes are visual signals and smells that deer use to communicate a variety of information to other deer 
  The number of buck rubs and buck scrapes in a given area changes as the density of the population of male deer in the area changes 
  As they rub the bark from trees  male deer leave behind chemicals produced by the glands in their foreheads  creating a scent that other deer can detect 
  The height of a buck rub  the type of tree used  and the direction in which the deer applies the rub can give different kinds of information to other deer 
  Buck rubs are created close to the breeding season of deer and may affect the timing of fertility in the female deer that visit the rubs

Characteristics of Roman Pottery

The pottery of ancient Romans is remarkable in several ways  The high quality of Roman pottery is very easy to appreciate when handling actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae  the large jars used throughout the Mediterranean for the transport and storage of liquids  such as wine and oil   However  it is impossible to do justice to Roman wares on the page  even when words can be backed up by photographs and drawing  Most Roman pottery is light and smooth to touch and very tough  although  like all pottery  it shatters if dropped on a hard surface  It is generally made with carefully selected and purified clay  worked to thin walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a kiln  pottery oven  capable of ensuring a consistent finish  With handmade pottery  inevitably there are slight differences between individual vessels of the same design and occasional minor blemishes  flaws   But what strikes the eye and the touch most immediately and most powerfully with Roman pottery is its consistent high quality 
This is not just an aesthetic consideration but also a practical one  These vessels are solid  brittle  but not fragile   they are pleasant and easy to handle  being light and smooth   and  with their hard and sometimes glossy  smooth and shiny  surfaces  they hold liquids well and are easy to wash  Furthermore  their regular and standardized shapes would have made them simple to stack and store  When people today are shown a very ordinary Roman pot and  in particular  are allowed to handle it  they often comment on how modern it looks and feels  and they need to be convinced of its true age 
As impressive as the quality of Roman pottery is its sheer massive quantity  When considering quantities  we would ideally like to have some estimates for overall production from particular sites of pottery manufacture and for overall consumption at specific settlements  Unfortunately  it is in the nature of the archaeological evidence  which is almost invariable only a sample of what once existed  that such figures will always be elusive  However  no one who has ever worked in the field would question the abundance of Roman pottery  particularly in the Mediterranean region  This abundance is notable in Roman settlements  especially urban sites  where the labor that archaeologists have to put into the washing and sorting of potsherds  fragments of pottery  constitutes a high proportion of the total work during the initial phases of excavation 
Only rarely can we derive any  real  quantities from deposits of broken pots  However  there is one exceptional dump  which does represent a very large part of the site s total history of consumption and for which an estimate of quantity has been produced  On the left bank of the Tiber River in Rome  by one of the river ports of the ancient city  is a substantial hill some 50 meters high called Monte Testaccio  It is made up entirely of broken oil amphorae  mainly of the second and third centuries A D  It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae  in which around 6 000million liters of oil were imported into the city from overseas  Imports into imperial Rome were supported by the full might of the state and were therefore quite exceptional   but the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio  and the productivity and complexity that lay behind them  nonetheless cannot fail to impress   This was a society with similarities to modern one    moving goods on a gigantic scale  manufacturing high quality containers to do so  and occasionally  as here  even discarding them on delivery 
Roman pottery was transported not only in large quantities but also over substantial distances  Many Roman pots  in particular amphorae and the fine wares designed for use at tables  could travel hundreds of miles    all over the Mediterranean and also further afield  But maps that show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story  What is more significant than any geographical spread is the access that different levels of society had to good quality products  In all but the remotest regions of the empire  Roman pottery of a high standard is common at the sites of humble villages and isolated farmsteads 


1  Paragraph 1 indicates which of the following about Roman pottery 
  Roman amphorae were of much higher quality overall than other Roman pottery 
  Roman pottery can best be appreciated when actual pieces are handled 
  Roman pottery declined slightly in quality when the use of fast wheels and kilns was introduced 
  Roman practical tableware spread more rapidly across the Mediterranean than amphorae did 
2  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as characteristics of Roman pottery EXCEPT 
  It was usually made with high quality clay 
  It generally did not weigh much 
  It did not break as easily as other ancient pottery 
  It sometimes had imperfections 
3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is NOT true of Roman vessels 
  They were good containers for liquids 
  Their shapes allowed for easy stacking and storing 
  They sometimes had shiny surfaces 
  Their true age is immediately apparent 
4  The author mentions the work of archaeologists in paragraph 3 in order to 
  support the idea that pottery was produced in large quantities by the Romans
  illustrate how hard it is for archaeologists to find complete pieces of Roman pottery
  contrast archaeological sites in Roman urban areas with other sites in the Mediterranean
  explain why the quantities of pottery found vary significantly from one site to another

5  The word  substantial  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  protected
  man made
  large

6  According to paragraph 4  Monte Testaccio is particularly important for archaeologists because archaeologists were able to
  conclude how amphorae manufacturing increased rapidly after the second century A D 
  find the locations where most of the amphorae in the Roman Empire were produced
  obtain relatively accurate calculations of the quantities of amphorae used over time in that place
  discover that the Roman state had supported amphorae production

7  The word  entirely  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  apparently
  completely
  basically
  mostly

8  Paragraph 4 indicates which of the following about the port on the Tiber River near Monte Testaccio 
  It was built around the third century A D 
  It was close to areas where large quantities of oil were produced 
  It was in use only for a very short period of time 
  It had impressive level of commercial activity 

9  The statement in paragraph 4 that amphorae delivered to the port near Monte Testaccio were occasionally discarded support which of the following 
  Traders at the port were often careless 
  The quality of the amphorae used at the port was not very good 
  The scale of the trade made it possible to waste quality amphorae sometimes 
  The importing of oil from overseas gradually declined  reducing the need for pottery containers 






10  The statement that  maps show the various spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has been found tell only part of the story  makes the point that
  maps indicate where specific pottery styles have been found  but they do not indicate where these styles originated
  maps show the geographical spread of Roman pottery but not the people who had access to it
  maps do not usually include pottery styles found in the remotest regions the Roman Empire
  archaeologist studying Roman pottery need to use a range of techniques in their investigations

Answer Choices

  Roman pottery is considered to be practical and of consistently high quality 
  Roman pottery was transported over long distances  and different levels of society had access to quality pottery 
  Archaeologists looking for the remains of Roman pottery concentrate on urban sites because that is where the oldest pieces of kitchenware and amphorae have been found 
  Even though the exact quantity of pottery produced by the Romans is almost impossible to calculate  it is certain that is was produced in large quantities 
  People are not familiar with the whole range of pottery of Romans created because most of the available pieces represent only a limited number of styles and shapes 
  It is still unclear to archaeologists what the role of the Roman state in the commercial success of Roman pottery was 



 
Competition
When several individuals of the same species or of several different species depend on the same limited resource  a situation may arise that is referred to as competition  The existence of competition has been long known to naturalists  its effects were described by Darwin in considerable detail  Competition among individuals of the same species  intraspecies competition   one of the major mechanisms of natural selection  is the concern of evolutionary biology  Competition among the individuals of different species  interspecies competition  is a major concern of ecology  It is one of the factors controlling the size of competing populations  and extreme cases it may lead to the extinction of one of the competing species  This was described by Darwin for indigenous New Zealand species of animals and plants  which died out when competing species from Europe were introduced 
No serious competition exists when the major needed resource is in superabundant supply  as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores  plant eaters   Furthermore  most species do not depend entirely on a single resource  if the major resource for a species becomes scarce  the species can usually shift to alternative resources  If more than one species is competing for a scarce resource  the competing species usually switch to different alternative resources  Competition is usually most severe among close relatives with similar demands on the environment  But it may also occur among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource  such as seed eating rodents and ants  The effects of such competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition  as happened 2 million years ago at the end of Pliocene  when North and South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama  North and South American species migrating across the Isthmus now came into competition with each other  The result was the extermination of a large fraction of the South American mammals  which were apparently unable to withstand the competition from invading North American species    although added predation was also an important factor  
To what extent competition determines the composition of a community and the density of particular species has been the source of considerable controversy  The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the spread or increase of one species and the concurrent reduction or disappearance of another species  The Russian biologist G  F  Gause performed numerous tow species experiments in the laboratory  in which one of the species became extinct when only a single kind of resource was available  On the basis of these experiments and of field observations  the so called law of competitive exclusion was formulated  according to which no two species can occupy the same niche  Numerous seeming exceptions to this law have since been found  but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two species  even though competing for a major joint resource  did not really occupy exactly the same niche 
Competition among species is of considerable evolutionary importance  The physical structure of species competing for resources in the same ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways that allow them to occupy different niches  Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap  The evolutionary effect of competition on species has been referred to as  species selection   however  this description is potentially misleading  Only the individuals of a species are subject to the pressures of natural selection  The effect on the well being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species  Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection 
Competition may occur for any needed resource  In the case of animals it is usually food  in the case of forest plants it may be light  in the case of substrate inhabitants it may be space  as in many shallow water bottom dwelling marine organisms  Indeed  it may be for any of the factors  physical as well as biotic  that are essential for organisms  Competition is usually the more severe the denser the population  Together with predation  it is the most important density dependent factor in regulating population growth

  types of natural selection
  dangers of natural selection
  problems natural selection solves
  ways natural selection works

2  According to paragraph 1  what is one effect of competition among individuals of different species 
  It results in the eventual elimination of the resource for which they are competing 
  It leads to competition among individuals of the same species 
  It encourages new species to immigrate to an area 
  It controls the number of individuals in the competing populations

4  In paragraph 1  why does the author mention what happened in New Zealand 
  To indicate that Darwin understood the importance of competition
  To illustrate that competition can lead to the extinction of species
  To identify where the idea of competition among species first arose
  To argue against the idea that the process of selection is a natural occurrence


















5  According to paragraph 2  competition is not usually a significant factor among two coexisting species when
  one of the species has only recently moved into the territory of the other
  the species are closely related to each other
  the population of one species is much larger than that of the other
  both of the species are herbivores

7  In paragraph 2  why does the author talk about what happened as a result of North and South America becoming joined at the Isthmus of Panama 
  To make the point that predation can have as much effect on species survival as competition does
  To show how the ability to switch to an alternative resource can give a species a competitive advantage
  To account for the current species composition of North and South America
  To provide an example of the serious effects of competition between unrelated species






8  Paragraph 3 supports the idea that Gause s experiments were important because they
  provided a situation in which competition could be removed from the interaction between two species
  showed that previous ideas about the extent to which competition determines the composition of a community were completely mistaken
  helped establish that competition will remove all but one species from any given ecological niche
  offered evidence that competition between species is minimal when there is an overabundance of a single food source
9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
  Apparent exceptions to this law usually involves cases in which two species compete for the same major resource but occupy slightly different niches 
  Although it may appear that two species always have different niches  many exceptions show that species compete with each other 
  Cases in which two species not only compete for a shared resource but also occupy similar niches are considered exceptions to this law 
  Cases in which the two species do not occupy that same niche yet still compete for the same resource are believed to be exceptions to this law 
10  According to paragraph 4  how does competition affect evolution 
  It results in the evolution of physical structures that allow the species to compete with each other more effectively 
  It results I the evolutionary extinction of all but one of the competing species 
  It results in the competing species evolving in such a way that they no longer compete for the same resources 
  It results in the competing species evolving to become so much like each other that competition between them eventually disappears 
11  According to paragraph 4   species selection  is a misleading term because it
  overemphasizes the role of selection pressure in species extinction
  suggests that selection pressures directly influence whole species
  does not make a distinction between species extinction and species evolution
  suggests that extinction always results whenever there is a competition

When necessary resources are limited  competition can occur among individuals of the same species or of different species 
 
 
 






Answer Choices

  Competition can eliminate a species  but since most species do not depend on a single resource  competition is often reduced by switching to alternative resources 
  Investigation of the ecological role of competition is difficult because ordinarily the competition cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from its presumed effects 
  Competition between a pair of species tends to lessen over time because the species tend to evolve to occupy different ecological niches and ranges 
  Competition between individual of the same species is usually for food whereas competition between species is usually for habitat 
  Experiments and field observation have established that competition between species is strong enough to prevent two species from occupying the same ecological niche 
  Competition is usually strongest when the density of the competing populations is the same 


 
The History of Waterpower
Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources to be harnessed to reduce the workload of people and animals  No one knows exactly when the waterwheel was invented  but irrigation systems existed at least 5 000 years ago  and it seems probable that the earliest waterpower device was the noria  a waterwheel that raised water for irrigation in attached jars  The device appears to have evolved no later than the fifth century B C   perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East 
The earliest waterpower mills were probably vertical axis mills for grinding corn  known as Norse or Greek mills  which seem to have appeared during the first or second century B C  in the Middle East and a few centuries later in Scandinavia  In the following centuries  increasingly sophisticated waterpower mills were built throughout the Roman Empire and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe  In England  the Saxons are thought to have used both horizontal and vertical axis wheels  The first documented English mill was in the eighth century  but three centuries later about 5 000 were recorded  suggesting that every settlement of any size had its mill 
Raising water and grinding corn were by no means the only uses of the waterpower mill  and during the following centuries  the applications of waterpower kept pace with the developing technologies of mining  iron working  paper making  and the wool and cotton industries  Water was the main source of mechanical power  and by the end of the seventeenth century  England alone is thought to have had some 20 000 working mill  
There was much debate on the relative efficiencies of different types of waterwheels  The period from about 1650 until 1800 saw some excellent scientific and technical investigations of different designs  They revealed output powers ranging from about 1 horsepower to perhaps 60 for the largest wheels and confirmed that for maximum efficiency  the water should pass across the blades as smoothly as possible and fall away with minimum speed  having given up almost all of its kinetic energy   They also proved that  in principle  the overshot wheel  a type of wheel in which an overhead stream of water powers the wheel  should win the efficiency competition  
But then steam power entered the scene  putting the whole future of waterpower in doubt  An energy analyst writing in the year 1800 would have painted a very pessimistic picture of the future for waterpower  The coal fired steam engine was taking over  and the waterwheel was fast becoming obsolete  However  like many later experts  this one would have suffered from an inability to see into the future  A century later the picture was completely different  by then  the world had an electric industry  and a quarter of its generating capacity was water powered 
The growth of the electric power industry was the result of a remarkable series of scientific discoveries and development in electrotechnology during the nineteenth century  but significant changes in what we might now call hydro  water  technology also played their part  In 1832  the year of Michael Faraday s discovery that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field  a young French engineer patented a new and more efficient waterwheel  His name was Benoit Fourneyron  and his device was the first successful water turbine   The word turbine comes from the Latin turbo  something that spins   The waterwheel  unaltered for nearly 2 000 years  had finally been superseded 
Half a century of development was needed before Faraday s discoveries in electricity were translated into full scale power stations  In 1881 the Godalming power station in Surrey  England  on the banks of the Wey River  created the world s first public electricity supply  The power source of this most modern technology was a traditional waterwheel  Unfortunately this early plant experienced the problem common to many forms of renewable energy  the flow in the Wey River was unreliable  and the waterwheel was soon replaced by a steam engine 
From this primitive start  the electric industry grew during the final 20 years of the nineteenth century at a rate seldom if ever exceeded by any technology  The capacity of individual power stations  many of them hydro plants  rose from a few kilowatts to over a megawatt in less than a decade

Answer Choices

 	The first water powered machines were probably used to grind corn  and as technology advanced  waterwheels were used as the main source of power in many industries 
 	Almost every large town in England had a waterpower mill  allowing England to become the world s leader in industries that depended on water for their power 
  In the late nineteenth century an electric power station in England began using water power from a nearby river  creating a dependable source of power that quickly replaced the steam engine 
  Waterpower mills were probably invented about the same time in the Middle East and Scandinavia and then spread to England by about the second century B C 
  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  design improvements in waterwheels led to discoveries of how to increase their efficiency and power output 
  After declining in importance in the early 1800 s  waterpower came back into demand by the end of the century as a means to power electric plants and water turbines

Role of Play in Development
Play is easier to define with examples than with concepts  In any case  in animals it consists of leaping  running  climbing  throwing  wrestling  and other movements  either along  with objects  or with other animals  Depending on the species  play may be primarily for social interaction  exercise  or exploration  One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance  dominance  predation  competition  and real fighting  Thus  whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals  and the intentions are not always clear from behaviors alone 
Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems  mainly birds and mammals  Play has been studied most extensively in primates and canids  dogs   Exactly why animals play is still a matter debated in the research literature  and the reasons may not be the same for every species that plays  Determining the functions of play is difficult because the functions may be long term  with beneficial effects not showing up until the animal s adulthood 
Play is not without considerable costs to the individual animal  Play is usually very active  involving movement in space and  at times  noisemaking  Therefore  it results in the loss of fuel or energy that might better be used for growth or for building up fat stores in a young animal  Another potential cost of this activity is greater exposure to predators since play is attention getting behavior  Great activities also increase the risk of injury in slipping or falling 
The benefits of play must outweigh costs  or play would not have evolved  according to Darwin s theory  Some of the potential benefits relate directly to the healthy development of the brain and nervous system  In one research study  two groups of young rats were raised under different conditions  One group developed in an  enriched  environment  which allowed the rats to interact with other rats  play with toys  and receive maze training  The other group lived in an  impoverished  environment in individual cages in a dimly lit room with little stimulation  At the end of the experiments  the results showed that the actual weight of the brains of the impoverished rats was less than that of those raised in the enriched environment  though they were fed the same diets   Other studies have shown that greater stimulation not only affects the size of the brain but also increase the number of connections between the nerve cells  Thus  active play may provide necessary stimulation to the growth of synaptic connections in the brain  especially the cerebellum  which is responsible for motor functioning and movements 
Play also stimulates the development of the muscle tissues themselves and may provide the opportunities to practice those movements needed for survival  Prey species  like young deer or goats  for example  typically play by performing sudden flight movements and turns  whereas predator species  such as cats  practice stalking  pouncing  and biting 
Play allows a young animal to explore its environment and practice skill in comparative safety since the surrounding adults generally do not expect the young to deal with threats or predators  Play can also provide practice in social behaviors needed for courtship and mating  Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially important for species that live in groups  like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and aggression and to understand the give and take involved in social groups  They need to learn how to be dominant and submissive because each monkey might have to play either role in the future  Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have  during which they engage in countless play experiences with their peers 
There is a danger  of course  that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others  potentially leading to aggression  This is especially true when play consists of practicing normal aggressive or predator behaviors  Thus  many species have evolved clear signals to delineate playfulness  Dogs  for example  will wag their tails  get down their front legs  and stick their behinds in the air to indicate  what follows is just for play   



1  According to paragraph 1  why is play difficult to define 
  Play must be defined with concepts  not examples 
  Play behavior often looks like nonplay behavior
  Play often occurs in the presence of animals that are not playing
  Play occurs independently of an animal s intentions







2  According to paragraph 2  which of the following presents a particular challenge to researchers who study play behavior in animals
  The delay between activities and the benefits the animal derives from them 
  The difficulty in determining which animal species play and which do not 
  The fact that for most animals  there is no clear transition from youth to full adulthood 
  The lack of research on the play behavior of animals other than canids and primates 
3  The word  considerable  in the passage is closest in the meaning to 
  Initial
  Practical
  Eventually
  Significant
4  According to paragraph 3  each of the following is a cost to animals that engage in play EXCEPT
  exposure to predators
  a buildup of fat stores
  a loss of fuel that could be used for growth
  risk of injury from slipping or falling







5  Why does the author include the comment  though they were fed the same diets  
  To show why rats living in impoverished environments need less food than those living in enriched environments
  To eliminate the possibility that differences in diet were responsibly for observed differences in brain weight
  To emphasize the point that rats were fed only the amount of food needed to keep them alive
  To suggest that rats fed the same diet have smaller brains than those fed a varied food


6  Paragraph 4 supports which of the following statements about an animal s brain 
  The heavier the brain  the richer the environment in which the animal was raised 
  The younger the animal  the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells 
  The larger the animal  the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells 
  The larger the animal s cerebellum  the larger will be the animal s nerve cells 


7  According to paragraph 5  why might play behavior of prey species be different from those of predator species 
  Unlike predator species  prey species use play to prevent inappropriate social behaviors  such as biting 
  Some prey species are physically incapable of certain types of predator movements 
  The survival of each species type is linked to particular sets of muscular movements 
  Predator species have more opportunities to practice play behaviors than prey species

  Only monkeys that have learned to control their selfish and aggressive behaviors can be involved in social groups 
  Selfish and aggressive animals like monkeys live in groups in order to practice appropriate social behaviors 
  Monkeys and other social animals need to learn behaviors appropriate for their social groups 
  Some monkeys are naturally too selfish and aggressive to understand the give and take of social groups  so they learn such important behaviors while young 



10  What can be inferred from paragraph 6 about the role of adults in play activities of the young 
  Adults help their young learn to become dominant within the social group 
  Young animals learn how to play from the adults within their social group 
  Adults allow the young to engage in play behaviors within a protected  sage environment 
  The long developmental period of some animals allows adults more time to teach their young how to deal with the threats of predators

Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems  mainly birds and mammals 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

  Although play often resembles aggression  flight  or other purposeful activities  researchers do not agree on the reasons for and functions of play
  Although many animals develop physically from play  too many young animals become victims of their natural predators while playing 
  Animals such as rats  dogs  deer  goats and monkeys learn how to be both dominant and submissive during play activities so that they will fit in better with their adult social groups 
  The function of play is still debated in the research literature primarily because each animal species uses so few of the many available types of play behavior 
  Energy expenditure and security risks are some of the costs to animals of play behavior  but the costs are not so great that they outweigh the long term benefits of play to the species 
  As experiments and observations have shown  animals that play at some stages of their development obtain neurological  muscular  or social benefits from the play behaviors 


 
The Pace of Evolutionary Change
A heated debate has enlivened recent studies of evolution  Darwin s original thesis  and the viewpoint supported by evolutionary gradualists  is that species change continuously but slowly and in small increments  Such changes are all but invisible over the short time scale of modern observations  and  it is argued  they are usually obscured by innumerable gaps in the imperfect fossil record  Gradualism  with its stress on the slow pace of change  is a comforting position  repeated over and over again in generations of textbooks  By the early twentieth century  the question about the rate of evolution had been answered in favor of gradualism to most biologists  satisfaction 
Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new evidence or new arguments based on old evidence come to light  In 1972 paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged conventional wisdom with an opposing viewpoint  the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis  which posits that species give rise to new species in relatively sudden bursts  without a lengthy transition period  These episodes of rapid evolution are separated by relatively long static spans during which a species may hardly change at all 
The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis attempts to explain a curious feature of the fossil record     one that has been familiar to paleontologist for more than a century but has usually been ignored  Many species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil record for millions of years     a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin s model of continuous change  Intermediated fossil forms  predicted by gradualism  are typically lacking  In most localities a given species of clam or coral persists essentially unchanged throughout a thick formation of rock  only to be replaced suddenly by a new and different species 
The evolution of North American horse  which was once presented as a classic textbook example of gradual evolution  is now providing equally compelling evidence for punctuated equilibrium  A convincing 50 million year sequence of modern horse ancestors     each slightly larger  with more complex teeth  a longer face  and a more prominent central toe    seemed to provide strong support for Darwin s contention that species evolve gradually  But close examination of those fossil deposits now reveals a somewhat different story  Horses evolved in discrete steps  each of which persisted almost unchanged for millions of years and was eventually replaced by a distinctive newer model  The four toed Eohippus preceded the three toed Miohippus  for example  but North American fossil evidence suggests a jerky  uneven transition between the two  If evolution had been a continuous  gradual process  one might expect that almost every fossil specimen would be slightly different from every year 
If it seems difficult to conceive how major changes could occur rapidly  consider this  an alteration of a single gene in files is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings 
The question about the rate of evolution must now be turned around  does evolution ever proceed gradually  or does it always occur in short bursts  Detailed field studies of thick rock formations containing fossils provide the best potential tests of the competing theories 
Occasionally  a sequence of fossil rich layers of rock permits a comprehensive look at one type of organism over a long period of time  For example  Peter Sheldon s studies of trilobites  a now extinct marine animal with a segmented body  offer a detailed glimpse into three million years of evolution in one marine environment  In that study  each of eight different trilobite species was observed to undergo a gradual change in the number of segments     typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time interval  No significant discontinuous were observed  leading Sheldon to conclude that environmental conditions were quite stable during the period he examined 
Similar exhaustive studies are required for many different kinds of organisms from many different periods  Most researchers expect to find that both modes of transition from one species to another are at work in evolution  Slow  continuous change may be the norm during periods of environmental stability  while rapid evolution of new species occurs during periods of environment stress  But a lot more studies like Sheldon s are needed before we can say for sure

  countless
  occasional
  large
  repeated

2  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true EXCEPT
  Darwin saw evolutionary change as happening slowly and gradually
  Gaps in the fossil record were used to explain why it is difficult to see continuous small changes in the evolution of species
  Darwin s evolutionary thesis was rejected because small changes could not be observed in the evolutionary record
  By the early twentieth century  most biologists believed that gradualism explained evolutionary change



3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
  The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis challenged gradualism  which holds that species evolve in relatively sudden bursts of brief duration 
  The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge was challenged in 1972 
  In 1972 Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged gradualism by positing that change from one species to another cannot occur without a lengthy transition period 
  The punctuate equilibrium hypothesis  in opposition to gradualism  holds that transitions from one species to another occur in comparatively sudden burst 

4  According to paragraph 1 and paragraph 2  the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis and the gradualism hypothesis differed about
  Whether the fossil record is complete
  Whether all species undergo change
  Whether evolution proceeds an a constant rate
  How many new species occur over long periods of time


5  According to paragraph 3  the lack of intermediate fossils in the fossil record of some species
  has been extensively studied by paleontologist for over a century
  contradicts the idea that most species have remained unchanged for millions of years
  challenges the view that evolutionary change is gradual
  is most common in the fossil records of clam and coral species

9  According to paragraph 7  Peter Sheldon s studies demonstrated which of the following about trilobites 
  They underwent gradual change over a long time period
  They experienced a number of discontinuous transitions during their history

The Invention of the Mechanical Clock

In Europe  before the introduction of the mechanical clock  people told time by sun  using  for example  shadow sticks or sun dials  and water clocks  Sun clocks worked  of course  only on clear days  water clocks misbehaved when the temperature fell toward freezing  to say nothing of long run drift as the result of sedimentation and clogging  Both these devices worked well in sunny climates  but in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time  while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night 

Medieval Europe gave new importance to reliable time  The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers  one of which was at night  requiring an alarm arrangement to waken monks before dawn  And then the new cities and towns  squeezed by their walls  had to know and order time in order to organize collective activity and ration space  They set a time to go to sleep  All this was compatible with older devices so long as there was only one authoritative timekeeper  but with urban growth and the multiplication of time signals  discrepancy brought discord and strife  Society needed a more dependable instrument of time measurement and found it in the mechanical clock 

We do not know who invented this machine  or where  It seems to have appeared in Italy and England  perhaps simultaneous invention  between 1275 and 1300  Once known  it spread rapidly  driving out water clocks but not solar dials  which were needed to check the new machines against the timekeeper of last resort  These early versions were rudimentary  inaccurate  and prone to breakdown 

Ironically  the new machine tended to undermine Catholic Church authority  Although church ritual had sustained an interest in timekeeping throughout the centuries of urban collapse that followed the fall of Rome  church time was nature s time  Day and night were divided into the same number of parts  so that except at the equinoxes  days and night hours were unequal  and then of course the length of these hours varied with the seasons  But the mechanical clock kept equal hours  and this implied a new time reckoning  The Catholic Church resisted  not coming over to the new hours for about a century  From the start  however  the towns and cities took equal hours as their standard  and the public clocks installed in town halls and market squares became the very symbol of a new  secular municipal authority  Every town wanted one  conquerors seized them as especially precious spoils of war  tourists came to see and hear these machines the way they made pilgrimages to sacred relics 

The clock was the greatest achievement of medieval mechanical ingenuity  Its general accuracy could be checked against easily observed phenomena  like the rising and setting of the sun  The result was relentless pressure to improve technique and design  At every stage  clockmakers led the way to accuracy and precision  they became masters of miniaturization  detectors and correctors of error  searchers for new and better  They were thus the pioneers of mechanical engineering and served as examples and teachers to other branches of engineering 

The clock brought order and control  both collective and personal  Its public display and private possession laid the basis for temporal autonomy  people could now coordinate comings and goings without dictation from above  The clock provided the punctuation marks for group activity  while enabling individuals to order their own work  and that of others  so as to enhance productivity  Indeed  the very notion of productivity is a by product of the clock  once on can relate performance to uniform time units  work is never the same  One moves from the task oriented time consciousness of the peasant  working on job after another  as time and light permit  and the time filling busyness of the domestic servant  who always had something to do  to an effort to maximize product per unit of time 


1  Why does the author provide the information that  in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time  while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night  
  To emphasize the variety of environments in which people used sun and water clocks to tell time
  To illustrate the disadvantage of sun and water clocks
  To provide an example of an area where water clocks have an advantage over sun clocks
  To counter the claim that sun and water clocks were used all over Europe


2  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are examples of the importance of timekeeping to medieval European society EXCEPT
  the need of different towns to coordinate timekeeping with each other
  the setting of specific times for the opening and closing of markets
  the setting of specific time for the start and finish of the working day
  the regulation of the performance of daily church rituals

3  According to paragraph 2  why did the medieval church need an alarm arrangement 
  The alarm warned the monks of discord or strife in the town 
  The church was responsible for regulating working hours and market hours 
  The alarm was needed in case fires were not put out each night 
  One of the church s daily rituals occurred during the night

  It enabled workers to be more task oriented 
  It pushed workers to work more hours every day 
  It led to a focus on productivity

The introduction of the mechanical clock caused important changes to the society of medieval Europe 
 
 
 

Answer Choices

  The increasing complexity of social and economic activity in medieval Europe led to the need for a more dependable means of keeping time than sun and water clocks provided 
  Because they were unreliable even in sunny climates  sun clocks and water clocks were rarely used in Europe  even before the invention of the mechanical clock 
  Before the mechanical clock  every city wanted a large number of timekeepers because more timekeepers allowed for better organization of collective activities 
  Soon after the invention of mechanical clocks  sun and water clocks became obsolete because mechanical clocks were far more accurate 
  Although society in general was quick to adopt the mechanical clock  the Catholic Church  resisted  it because  it challenged the authority of the church  
  Clockmakers introduced  precision  engineering  and their clocks  gave individuals and groups more control over the organization  of their  activities

Speciation in Geographically Isolated Populations

Evolutionary biologists believe that speciation  the formation of a new species  often begins when some kind of physical barrier arises and divides a population of a single species into separate subpopulations  Physical separation between subpopulations promotes the formation of new species because once the members of one subpopulation can no longer mate with members of another subpopulation  they cannot exchange variant genes that arise in one of the subpopulations  In the absence of gene flow between the subpopulations  genetic differences between the groups begin to accumulate  Eventually the subpopulations become so genetically distinct that they cannot interbreed even if the physical barriers between them were removed  At this point the subpopulations have evolved into distinct species  This route to speciation is known as allopatry   allo   means  different   and  patria  means  homeland    
Allopatric speciation may be the main speciation route  This should not be surprising  since allopatry is pretty common  In general  the subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance  So even under normal situations the gene flow among the subpopulations is more of an intermittent trickle than a steady stream  In addition  barriers can rapidly arise and shut off the trickle  For example  in the 1800s a monstrous earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River  a large river flowing in the central part of the United States of America  The change separated populations of insects now living along opposite shore  completely cutting off gene flow between them  
Geographic isolation also can proceed slowly  over great spans of time  We find evidence of such extended events in the fossil record  which affords glimpses into the breakup of formerly continuous environments  For example  during past ice ages  glaciers advanced down through North America and Europe and gradually cut off parts of populations from one another  When the glaciers retreated  the separated populations of plants and animals came into contact again  Some groups that had descended from the same parent population were no longer reproductively compatible  they had evolved into separate species  In other groups  however  genetic divergences had not proceeded so far  and the descendants could still interbreed  for them  reproductive isolation was not completed  and so speciation had not occurred 
Allopatric speciation can also be brought by the imperceptibly slow but colossal movements of the tectonic plates that make up Earth s surface  About 5 million years ago such geologic movements created the land bridge between North America and South America that we call the Isthmus of Panama  The formation of the isthmus had important consequences for global patterns of ocean water flow  While previously the gap between the continents had allowed a free flow of water  now the isthmus presented a barrier that divided the Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean  This division set the stage for allopatric speciation among populations of fishes and other marine species  
In the 1980s  John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes  one population from the Atlantic side of isthmus  the other from the Pacific side  He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each population  Graves found that all four Pacific enzymes function better at lower temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes  This is significant because Pacific seawater is typically 2 to 3 degrees cooler than seawater on the Atlantic side of isthmus  Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed slight differences in amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the four pairs  This is significant because the amino acid sequence of an enzyme is determined by genes  
Graves drew two conclusions from these observations  First  at least some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and Pacific fish populations were not random but were the result of evolutionary adaptation  Second  it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the isthmus are starting to genetically diverge from each other  Because Graves s study of geographically isolated populations of isthmus fishes offers a glimpse of the beginning of a process of gradual accumulation of mutations that are neutral or adaptive  divergences here might be evidence of allopatric speciation in process

2  According to paragraph 1  allopatric speciation involves which of the following 
 The division of a population into subspecies
 The reuniting of separated populations after they have become distinct species
 The movement of a population to a new homeland
 The absence of gene flow between subpopulations


3  Why does the author provide the information that  the subpopulations of most species are separated from each other by some measurable distance  
 To indicate how scientists are able to determine whether subpopulations of a species are allopathic 
 To define what it means for a group of animals or plants to be a subpopulation 
 To suggest that allopathic speciation is not the only route to speciation 
 To help explain why allopatric speciation is a common way for new species to come about 
4  The word  accumulate  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Become more significant

5  In paragraph 2  why does the author mention that some insect populations were separated from each other by a change in the course of Mississippi River caused by an earthquake 
 To make the point that some kind of physical barrier separates the subpopulations of most species
 To support the claim that the condition of allopatry can sometimes arise in a short time
 To provide an example of a situation in which gene flow among the subpopulations of a species happens at a slow rate
 To explain insects living along opposite shores of the Mississippi River are very different from each other



6  According to paragraph 3  separation of subpopulations by glaciers resulted in speciation in those groups of plants and animals that
 were reproductively isolated even after the glaciers disappeared
 had adjusted to the old conditions caused by the glaciers
 were able to survive being separated from their parent population
 had experienced some genetic divergences from their parent population

8  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of the geologic movements that brought about the Isthmus of Panama 
 The movement brought populations of certain fishes and marine organisms into contact with one another for the first time 
 The movement transferred populations of fishes and other marine animals between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans 
 The movement created conditions that allowed water to flow more freely between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans 
 The movement created conditions for the formation of new species of fished and other marine animals 





9  The word  sequence  in the passage is closest in meaning to

10  According to paragraph 5  by comparing the enzymes from two related groups of fishes on opposite sides of the Isthmus  Graves found evidence that
 there were slight genetic divergences between the two groups
 the Atlantic group of fishes were descended from the Pacific group of fishes
 the temperature of water on either side of the Isthmus had changed
 genetic changes in the Atlantic group of fishes were more rapid and frequent than in the Pacific group of fishes


11  It can be inferred from paragraph 5 and 6 that the reason Graves concluded that some of the differences between the Pacific and Atlantic enzymes were not random was that 
 each of the Pacific enzymes works better in cooler waters
 the Enzymes of the Atlantic fish populations had not changed since the formation of the Isthmus of Panama
 gel electrophoresis showed that the changes benefited both the Atlantic and the Pacific fish populations
 the differences between the enzymes disappeared when the two fish populations were experimentally switched to other side of the isthmus

Answer Choices

 Allopatric speciation is common because the gene flow between subpopulations is generally limited and the barriers that completely separate subpopulations can arise in a variety of ways 
 During past ice ages  some  but not all  subpopulations separated by glaciers evolved into distinct species 
 Speciation does not need to take place through allopatry because subpopulations will form distinct species whenever there are adaptive advantage to not 
 Physical barriers from glaciers and the movement of tectonic plates form so slowly that the subpopulations on either side of the barriers usually do not form distinct species 
 Graves s study of fish populations separately by the Isthmus of Panama may well provide a picture of the beginning stages of speciation 
 Graves s study of physically separated fish populations show that there must be large differences between the environments of the isolated populations if allopatric speciation is to take place  

Early Childhood Education

Preschools  educational programs for children under the age of five  differ significantly from one country to another according to the views that different societies hold regarding the purpose of early childhood education  For instance  in a cross country comparison of preschools in China  Japan  and the United States  researchers found that parents in the three countries view the purpose of preschools very differently  Whereas parents in China tend to see preschools primarily as a way of giving children a good start academically  Japanese parents view them primarily as a way of giving children the opportunity to be members of a group  In the United States  in comparison  parents regard the primary purpose of preschools as making children more independent and self reliant  although obtaining a good academic start and having group experience are also important 
While many programs designed for preschoolers focus primarily on social and emotional factors  some are geared mainly toward promoting cognitive gains and preparing preschoolers for the formal instruction they will experience when they start kindergarten  In the United States  the best known program designed to promote future academic success is Head Start  Established in the 1960s when the United States declared the War on Poverty  the program has served over 13 million children and their families  The program  which stresses parental involvement  was designed to serve the  whole child   including children s physical health  self confidence  social responsibility  and social and emotional development 
Whether Head Start is seen as successful or not depends on the lens through which one is looking  If  for instance  the program is expected to provide long term increases in IQ  intelligence quotient  scores  it is a disappointment  Although graduates of Head Start programs tend to show immediate IQ gains  these increases do not last  On the other hand  it is clear that Head Start is meeting its goal of getting preschoolers ready for school  Preschoolers who participate in Head Start are better prepared for future schooling than those who do not  Furthermore  graduates of Head Start programs have better future school grade  Finally  some research suggests that ultimately Head Start graduates show higher academic performance at the end of high school  although the gains are modest 
In addition  results from other types of preschool readiness programs indicate that those who participate and graduate are less like to repeat grades  and they are more like to complete school than readiness program  for every dollar spent on the program  taxpayers saved seven dollars by the time the graduates reached the age of 27 
The most recent comprehensive evaluation of early intervention programs suggests that  taken as a group  preschool programs can provide significant benefits  and that government funds invested early in life may ultimately lead to a reduction in future costs  For instance  compared with children who did not participate in early intervention programs  participants in various programs showed gains in emotional or cognitive development  better educational outcomes  increased economic self sufficiency  reduced levels of criminal activity  and improved health related behaviors  Of course  not every program produced all these benefits  and not every child benefited to the same extent  Furthermore  some researchers argue that less expensive programs are just as good as relatively expensive ones  such as Head Start  Still  the results of the evaluation were promising  suggesting that the potential benefits of early intervention can be substantial 
Not everyone agrees that programs that seek to enhance academic skills during the preschool years are a good thing  In fact  according to developmental psychologist David Elkind  United States society tends to push children so rapidly that they begin to feel stress and pressure at a young age  Elkind argues that academic success is largely dependent upon factors out of parents  control  such as inherited abilities and a child s rate of maturation  Consequently  children of a particular age cannot be expected to master educational material without taking into account their current level of cognitive development  In short  children require development appropriate educational practice  which is education that is based on both typical development and the unique characteristics of a given child

 get a good academic start
 expand their emotional development
 become more independent
 experience being part of a group

2  The word  Whereas  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Although
 Because
 Moreover
 Already

3  The word  focus  in the passage is closest in meaning to

4  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the Head Start program was designed to serve children who
 come from families that do not have a lot of money
 are not doing very well in kindergarten
 were born in the 1950s
 need programs that focus primarily on social and emotional factors



5  According to paragraph 3  the Head Start program had NOT been successful at which of the following 
 Helping children adjust to school
  Providing long term increase in IQ scores
 Improving school performance throughout high school
 Preventing children from being placed in special education classes



6  in paragraph 4  the author mentions the  results from other types of readiness programs  to 
 provide support for the idea that preschool readiness programs have been somewhat successful
 question the idea that Head Start is more effective than other preschool readiness programs
 indicate school completion is usually the most reliable indicator of success in most reading programs
 emphasize that participation in readiness programs can be increased if costs are reduced



7  According to paragraph 4  a cost benefit analysis of one preschool readiness program revealed that
 only one dollar s worth of benefit was gained for every seven dollars spent on the program
 the benefits of the program lasted only until the participants reached age 27
 taxpayers saved seven dollars for every dollar spent on the program
 to be successful  the program would need to receive about seven times as much money as it currently receives







8  The word  comprehensive  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 easily understood
 thorough
 respectable
 objective




9  Paragraph 5 mentions that participants in early intervention programs have been shown to do all of the following better than nonparticipants EXCEPT
 Take care of their health
 Support themselves financially
 Take care of their own children
 Have increased emotional development



10  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is true about the benefits of early intervention programs 
 These programs produce good short term benefits but few long term benefits 
 Only the most expensive programs provide substantial benefits 
 The Head Start provides a range of benefits that no other program can provide 
 Some children benefit more than others do from these programs

Answer Choices

 	In addition to stressing academic development  preschools should be enjoyable  since studies show that children benefit from programs they find fun 
 	Preschool programs such as Head Start have been shown to help prepare children for school and may also have long term benefits in helping children become effective adults 
 	Studies have shown that preschool programs are most effective when they focus on only one area of development rather than trying to serve the  whole 
 	The primary purpose of preschool programs varies by country  with some stressing the importance of group experience  and others self reliance or getting a good academic start 
 	Critics of preschool programs arguer that these programs put undue pressure on children and may not be effective if children are not developmentally ready for academic work 
 	David Elkind is a critic of public funded preschool programs  arguing that the parent cannot control their children s emotional development 

Savanna Formation
Located in tropical areas at low altitudes  savannas are stable ecosystems  some wet and some dry consisting of vast grasslands with scattered trees or shrubs  They occur on a wide range of soil types and in extremes of climate  There is no simple or single factor that determines if a given site will be a savanna  but some factors seem to play important roles in their formation  

Savannas typically experience a rather prolonged dry season  One theory behind savanna formation is that wet forest species are unable to withstand the dry season  and thus savanna  rather than rain forest  is favored on the site  Savannas experience an annual rainfall of between 1 000 and 2 000 millimeters  most of it falling in a five  to eight month wet season  Though plenty of rain may fall on a savanna during the year  for at least part of the year little does  creating the drought stress ultimately favoring grasses  Such conditions prevail throughout much of northern South America and Cuba  but many Central American savannas as well as coastal areas of Brazil and the island of Trinidad do not fit this pattern  In these areas  rainfall per month exceeds that in the above definition  so other factors must contribute to savanna formation 

In many characteristics  savanna soils are similar to those of some rain forests  though more extreme  For example  savanna soils  like many rain forest soils  are typically oxisols  dominated by certain oxide minerals  and ultisols  soils containing no calcium carbonate   with a high acidity and notably low concentrations of such minerals as phosphorus  calcium  magnesium  and potassium  while aluminum levels are high  Some savannas occur on wet  waterlogged soils  others on dry  sandy  well drained soils  This may seem contradictory  but it only means that extreme soil conditions  either too wet or too dry for forests  are satisfactory for savannas  More moderate conditions support moist forests 

Waterlogged soils occur in areas that are flat or have poor drainage  These soils usually contain large amounts of clay and easily become water saturated  Air cannot penetrate between the soil particles  making the soil oxygen poor  By contrast  dry soils are sandy and porous  their coarse textures permitting water to drain rapidly  Sandy soils are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals and so tend to be nutritionally poor  Though most savannas are found on sites with poor soils  because of either moisture conditions or nutrient levels of both   poor soils can and do support lush rain forest 

Most savannas probably experience mild fires frequently and major burns every two years or so  Many savanna and dry forest plant species are called pyrophytes  meaning they are adapted in various ways to withstand occasional burning  Frequent fire is a factor to which rain forest species seem unable to adapt  although ancient charcoal remains from Amazon forest soils dating prior to the arrival of humans suggest that moist forests also occasionally burn  Experiments suggest that if fire did not occur in savannas in the Americas  species composition would change significantly  When burning occurs  it prevents competition among plant species from progressing to the point where some species exclude others  reducing the overall diversity of the ecosystem  But in experimental areas protected from fire  a few perennial grass species eventually come to dominate  outcompeting all others  Evidence from other studies suggests that exclusion of fire results in markedly decreased plant species richness  often with an increase in tree density  There is generally little doubt that fire is a significant factor in maintaining savanna  certainly in most regions 

On certain sites  particularly in South America  savanna formation seems related to frequent cutting and burning of moist forests for pastureland  Increase in pastureland and subsequent overgrazing have resulted in an expansion of savanna  The thin upper layer of humus  decayed organic matter  is destroyed by cutting and burning  Humus is necessary for rapid decomposition of leaves by bacteria and fungi and for recycling by surface roots  Once the humus layer disappears  nutrients cannot be recycled and leach from the soil  converting soil from fertile to infertile and making it suitable only for savanna vegetation  Forests on white  sandy soil are most susceptible to permanent alteration

 provide additional examples of savannas in areas with five to eight month wet seasons
 indicate areas where savannas are being gradually replaced by rain forests






3  According to paragraph 3  rain forests and savannas differ in that 
 the soils in rain forests contain fewer minerals than savanna soils do
 savannas affect soil conditions more than rain forests do
 unlike rain forests  savannas prefer sandy  well drained soils to solids that are very wet
 unlike rain forests  savannas may develop under both very dry and very wet soil conditions

4  The word  notably  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 similarly

5  According to paragraph 3  all of the following are true of savanna soils EXCEPT
 They have high concentrations of potassium 
 They contain high levels of aluminum

 They contain large amounts of certain oxide minerals 

6  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of waterlogged soils 
 Their upper layers are usually sandy and porous 
 They cannot support savannas 
 They contain little oxygen 
 They are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals 


7  The fact that  poor soils can and do support lush rain forest  suggests that 
 poor soils alone may not be enough to explain why an area becomes a savanna
 rain forest vegetation can significantly lower the quality of soils
 drought stress is the single most important factor in savanna formation
 minerals are more important than moisture for the growth of trees

Answer Choices

 	Savannas can form in areas with a five to eight month wet season  but they more commonly have a longer wet season 
 	Soil stress caused by drought  extreme moisture  or low nutrient levels favors the formation of savannas 
 	Studies conducted in various regions indicate that an upper layer of white  sandy  soil is present in most permanent savannas 
 	Drought stress affects trees and shrubs in savannas far less than it affects savanna grasses 
 	Frequent fire is a major factor contributing to the formation and maintenance of savannas 
 	In some areas  human cutting and burning is associated with savanna formation  and increase in pastureland had led to savanna expansion

Colonization is one way in which plants can change the ecology of a site  Colonization is a process with two components  invasion and survival  The rate at which a site is colonized by plants depends on both the rate at which individual organisms  seeds  spores  immature or mature individuals  arrive at the site and their success at becoming established and surviving  Success in colonization depends to a great extent on there being a site available for colonization – a safe site where disturbance by fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed competing species or reduced levels of competition and other negative interactions to a level at which the invading species can become established  For a given rate of invasion  colonization of a moist  fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry  infertile site because of poor survival on the latter  A fertile  plowed field is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds  whereas a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse  infertile parent material may remain virtually free of vegetation for many months or even years despite receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed field 

     Both the rate of invasion and the rate of extinction vary greatly among different plant species  Pioneer species – those that occur only in the earliest stages of colonization   tend to have high rates of invasion because they produce very large numbers of reproductive propagules  seeds  spores  and so on  and because they have an efficient means of dispersal  normally  wind 

If colonizers produce short lived reproductive propagules  they must produce very large numbers unless they have an efficient means of dispersal to suitable new habitats  Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small  relatively short lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means if reaching the appropriate type of habitat  Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants  such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long lived seeds  Many forest plants seem to exhibit the latter adaptation  and viable seeds of pioneer species can be found in large numbers on some forest floors  For example  as many as 1 125 viable seeds per square meter were found in a 100 year old Douglas fir western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia  Nearly all the seeds that had germinated from this seed bank were from pioneer species  The rapid colonization of such sites after disturbance is undoubtedly in part a reflection of the large seed band on the forest floor  

 An adaptation that is well developed in colonizing species is a high degree of variation in germination  the beginning of a seed s growth   Seeds of a given species exhibit a wide range of germination dates  increasing the probability that at least some of the seeds will germinate during a period of favorable environmental conditions  This is particularly important for species that colonize an environment where there is no existing vegetation to ameliorate climatic extremes and in which there may be great climatic diversity 

Species succession in plant communities  i e   the temporal sequence of appearance and disappearance of species is dependent on events occurring at different stages in the life history of a species  Variation in rates of invasion and growth plays an important role in determining patterns of succession  especially secondary succession  The species that are first to colonize a site are those that produce abundant seed that is distributed successfully to new sites  Such species generally grow rapidly and quickly dominate new sites  excluding other species with lower invasion and growth rates  The first community that occupies a disturbed area therefore may be composed of specie with the highest rate of invasion  whereas the community of the subsequent stage may consist or plants with similar survival rates but lower invasion rates 
1  According to paragraph 1  how does disturbance of a site influence its colonization by a plant species   
  Disturbance reduces or eliminates competition by other species 
    Disturbance increases negative interactions with other organisms on the site 
    Disturbance prevents a plant species from colonizing a new site 
     Disturbance reduces the fertility of a site

5  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
  The seeds of pioneer species are usually carried by the wind to fertile sites  where they reproduce very efficiently 
  Pioneer species are successful invaders because they produce lots of seeds that are dispersed effectively 
  Pioneer species produce their largest numbers of propagules during the earliest stages of their colonization 
  Pioneer species reproduce very quickly and efficiently because they produce very large number of seeds 


6  What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the reason that large seeds are dispersed by birds or small animals rather than by wind 
     Large seeds are easier for birds and animals to see than are the small seeds dispersed by the wind 
    Large seeds are too heavy for the wind to disperse 
     Large seeds cannot be eaten by birds and animals 
     Large seeds are short lived and thus require a more efficient means of dispersal than small seeds do 

7  The phrase  the latter adaptation  in the passage refers to
     producing fewer seeds
     producing larger seeds
     dispersal by birds and small mammals
     producing long lived seeds

14  Prose Summary
   The ecology of a site is changed through its colonization by new plants that arrive and grow there 

Answer Choices 
 The species that first colonize a disturbed site are typically ones that produce a large number of efficiently dispersed seeds 
  Plants that cannot successfully compete with other species can invade and colonize a site only if it is fertile and moist  such as a plowed field 
  Pioneer species arrive at a site first but have lower survival rates than do species that arrive later 
  Producing seeds that germinate at various time over long periods allows some plants to colonize sites that only occasionally present the right conditions for growth 
 Large  long lived seeds tend to result in large seed bank with short germination periods requiring favorable environmental conditions for development 
  The successive appearance and disappearance of species on a site is a result of variation in species  rates of invasion  growth  and survival    


























 
Siam  1851 – 1910
In the late nineteenth century  political and social changes were occurring rapidly in Siam  now Thailand   The old ruling families were being displaced by an evolving centralized government  These families were pensioned off  given a sum of money to live on  or simply had their revenues taken away or restricted  their sons were enticed away to schools for district officers  later to be posted in some faraway province  and the old patron client relations that had bound together local societies simply disintegrated  Local rulers could no longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal cases  and with the ending in 1905 of the practice of forcing peasant farmers to work part time for local rulers  the rulers no longer had a regular base for relations with rural populations  The old local ruling families  then  were severed from their traditional social context   

The same situation viewed from the perspective of the rural population is even more complex  According to the government s first census of the rural population  taken in 1905  there were about thirty thousand villages in Siam  This was probably a large increase over the figure even two or three decades earlier  during the late 1800s  It is difficult to imagine it now  but Siam s Central Plain in the late 1800s was nowhere near as densely settled as it is today  There were still forests closely surrounding Bangkok into the last of the nineteenth century  and even at century s end there were wild elephants and tigers roaming the countryside only twenty or thirty miles away 

Much population movement involved the opening up of new lands for rice cultivation  Two things made this possible and encouraged it to happen  First  the opening of the kingdom to the full force of international trade by the Boring Treaty  1855  rapidly encouraged economic specialization in the growing of rice  mainly to feed the rice deficient portions of Asia  India and china in particular  The average annual volume of rice exported from Siam grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms per year at the turn of the century  and over the same period the average price per kilogram doubled  During the same period  the area planted in rice increased from about 230 000 acres to more than350  000 acres  This growth was achieved as the result of the collective decisions of thousands of peasants families to expand the amount of land they cultivated  clear and plant new land  or adopt more intensive methods of agriculture 

They were able to do so because of our second consideration  They were relatively freer than they had been half a century earlier  Over the course of the Fifth Reign  1868 1910   the ties that bound rural people to the aristocracy and local ruling elites were greatly reduced  Peasants now paid a tax on individuals instead of being required to render labor service to the government  Under these conditions  it made good sense to thousands of peasant families to in effect work full time at what they had been able to do only part time previously because of the requirement to work for the government  grow rice for the marketplace 

Numerous changes accompanied these developments  The rural population both dispersed and grew  and was probably less homogeneous and more mobile than it had been a generation earlier  The villages became more vulnerable to arbitrary treatment by government bureaucrats as local elites now had less control over them  By the early twentieth century  as government modernization in a sense caught up with what had been happening in the countryside since the 1870s  the government bureaucracy intruded more and more into village life  Provincial police began to appear  along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds and registration for compulsory military service  Village handicrafts diminished or died out completely as people bought imported consumer goods  like cloth and tools  instead of making them themselves  More economic variation took shape in rural villages  as some grew prosperous from farming while others did not  As well as can be measured  rural standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign  But the statistical averages mean little when measured against the harsh realities of peasant life

    The non farmers among them were helped by the government more than the farmers among them were 
    They were more prosperous when they were ruled by local elites than when they were ruled by the more modern government of the Fifth Reign   

 12  According to paragraph 5  the government bureaucracy intruded in village life by 
    requiring the people to register their cattle and land 
    requiring the people to buy certain kinds of imported goods
    discouraging the people from making handicrafts and tools 
    encouraging more people to take up farming

14  Prose Summary
During the late nineteenth century  changes in Siam s power structure had important economic consequences 

Answer Choices 
  Population movement occurred and rice cultivation intensified because Siam became more actively involved in international trade 
 Changes in taxation and the ending of the requirement that people work part time for the rulers allowed farmers to produce more rice for the marketplace 
  Population increases occurred in part because Siam s farmers were able to produce more rice to feed the population 
  Land became so valuable that villagers had to pay the government for the land that they worked on 
  Although rural living standards may have improved somewhat  prosperity varied from village to village and government bureaucracy played a greater role in village life 
  Government modernization in the early twentieth century resulted in the loss of some freedoms that the rural population had gained from the traditional ruling classes 









 
Distributions of Tropical Bee Colonies

In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how social interactions can produce and enforce regular spacing in a population  They studied competition and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica  Though these bees do no sting  rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites 
Stingless bees are abundant in tropical and subtropical environments  where they gather nectar and pollen from a wide variety of flowers  They generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers  Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies  while other species are not  Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high density clumps  Nonaggressive species feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers 
Hubbell and Johnson studied several species of stingless bees to determine whether there is a relationship between aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution  They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions  while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped  clumped  distribution  They concentrated their studies on a thirteen hectare tract of tropical dry forest that contained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees 
Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions  they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions  So as one of the first steps in their study  they mapped the distributions of trees suitable for nesting  They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly through the study area  They also found that the number of potential nest sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies  What did these measurements show the researchers  The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by availability of suitable trees  and a clumped or regular distribution of colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or regular distribution of potential nest sites 
Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately  and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly  All four species with regular nest distributions were highly aggressive to bees from other colonies of their own species  The fifth species was not aggressive  and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area 
The researchers also studied the process by which the aggressive species establish new colonies  Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species  Aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with pheromones  chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their species  The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site  however  it also attracts workers from other nests 
If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time  they may fight for possession  Fights may be escalated into protracted battles  The researchers observed battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks  Each dawn  fifteen to thirty workers from two competing colonies arrived at the contested nest site  The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other  In the displays  pairs of bees faced each other  slowly flew vertically to a height of about three meters  and then grappled each other to the ground  When the two bees hit the ground  they separated  faced off  and performed another aerial display  Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights  which were apparently ritualized  The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A M  each morning  only to re form and begin again the next day just after dawn  While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality  fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1  000 bees in a single battle

2 	According to paragraph 2  some species of stingless bees are aggressive mainly toward
 Nonaggressive bees that forage on the same flowers
 Aggressive bees of other species
 Bees from their own colony
 Bees of their own species from different colonies  

3 	According to paragraph 3  Hubbell and Johnson hypothesized that
 The distribution pattern of bee colonies determines the degree of aggressiveness the bees display
 Nests of nonaggressive bees have either a random or a clumped distribution  while nests of aggressive bees have a regular distribution
 nests of nonaggressive bees are generally both closer together and more regularly distributed than those of aggressive bees
 nests of aggressive bees tend to be more regular in shape than those of nonaggressive bees


 


4  According to paragraph 4  why did Hubbell and Johnson begin their study by mapping all the potential nest sites 
 To determine whether the availability of potential nest sites played a role in the distribution of bee colonies
 To know exactly where in the study area the colonies of all the different bee species were located
 To be sure that suitable nesting sites were equally available in all parts of study area
 To find out whether different species of bees preferred different types of trees as potential nest sites

 The limited number of colonies was not due to the distribution or availability of potential nesting sites 
 There was no lack of suitable trees or potential nesting sites in the study area 
 The number of nests was directly related to the number or the distribution of suitable trees 
 Neither the number nor the distribution of colonies could be explained by the availability of suitable nest sites 


6  According to paragraph 5  Hubbell and Johnson determined
  the order in which the colonies in the study area had been established
  the level of aggressiveness of each of the nine species
  the distribution pattern of the nests of five of the nine species
  the number of colonies of each of the nine species

7  Why does the author indicate that  The fifth species was not aggressive  and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area  
 To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson s original hypothesis 
 To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness
 To introduce the hypothesis that  within the same species  not all colonies are aggressive
 To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites

The First Civilizations
      Evidence suggests that an important stimulus behind the rise of early civilizations was the development of settled agriculture  which unleashed a series of changes in the organization of human communities that culminated in the rise of large ancient empires 
The exact time and place that crops were first cultivated successfully is uncertain  Many prehistorians believe that farming may have emerged in dependently in several different areas of the world when small communities  driven by increasing population and a decline in available food resources  began to plant seeds in the ground in an effort to guarantee their survival  The first farmers  who may have lived as long as 10 000 years ago  undoubtedly used simple techniques and still relied primarily on other forms of food production  such as hunting  foraging  or pastoralism  The real breakthrough took place when farmers began to cultivate crops along the floodplains of river systems  The advantage was that crops grown in such areas were not as dependent on rainfall and therefore produced a more reliable harvest  An additional benefit was that the sediment carried by the river waters deposited nutrients in the soil  thus enabling the farmer to cultivate a single plot of ground for many years without moving to a new location  Thus  the first truly sedentary  that is  nonmigratory  societies were born  As time went on  such communities gradually learned how to direct the flow of water to enhance the productive capacity of the land  while the introduction of the iron plow eventually led to the cultivation of heavy soils not previously susceptible to agriculture 

      The spread of this river valley agriculture in various parts of Asia and Africa was the decisive factor in the rise of the first civilizations  The increase in food production in these regions led to a significant growth in population  while efforts to control the flow of water to maximize the irrigation of cultivated areas and to protect the local inhabitants from hostile forces outside the community provoked the first steps toward cooperative activities on a large scale  The need to oversee the entire process brought about the emergence of an elite that was eventually transformed into a government 

      The first clear steps in the rise of the first civilizations took place in the fourth and third millennia B C  in Mesopotamia  northern Africa  India  and China  How the first governments took shape in these areas is not certain  but anthropologists studying the evolution of human communities in various parts of the world have discovered that one common stage in the process is the emergence of what are called  big men  within a single village or a collection of villages  By means of their military prowess  dominant personalities  or political talents  these people gradually emerge as the leaders of that community  In time  the  big men  become formal symbols of authority and pass on that authority to others within their own family  As the communities continue to grow in size and material wealth  the  big men  assume hereditary status  and their allies and family members are transformed into a hereditary monarchy 

      The appearance of these sedentary societies had a major impact on the social organizations  religious beliefs  and way of life of the peoples living within their boundaries  With the increase in population and the development of centralized authority came the emergence of the cities  While some of these urban centers were identified with a particular economic function  such as proximity to gold or iron deposits or a strategic location on a major trade route  others served primarily as administrative centers or the site of temples for the official cult or other ritual observances  Within these cities  new forms of livelihood appeared to satisfy the growing need for social services and consumer goods  Some people became artisans or merchants  while others became warriors  scholars  or priests  In some cases  the physical division within the first cities reflected the strict hierarchical character of the society as a whole  with a royal palace surrounded by an imposing wall and separate from the remainder of the urban population  In other instances  such as the Indus River Valley  the cities lacked a royal precinct and the ostentatious palaces that marked their contemporaries elsewhere

Answer Choices
 Prehistorians disagree as to whether early farmers first cultivated crops along floodplains or first tried cultivating crops in less successful environments  
 Cultivation in fertile river valleys resulted in predictable harvests  which meant that farmers no longer needed to migrate constantly in search of food 
 Because crops could be cultivated more successfully where farmers were not completely dependent on rainfall  hostilities between groups arose over control of the river systems 
 The need to organize the effort to ensure the food supply and defend the land led to the formation of elite supervising groups that eventually became the first governments 
 Increasingly centralized forms of administration resulted in the emergence of social classes and in the development of cities as trade  administration  or religious centers 
  Unlike other early civilizations  those that developed in the Indus River Valley did not have any spectacular palaces or areas for exclusive use by the authorities 
 










 
Railroads and Commercial Agriculture in Nineteenth Century United States
      By 1850 the United States possessed roughly 9 000 miles of railroad track  then years later it had over 30 000 miles  more than the rest of the world combined  Much of the new construction during the 1850s occurred west of the Appalachian Mountains – over 2 000 miles in the states of Ohio and Illinois alone 
      The effect of the new railroad lines rippled outward through the economy  Farmers along the tracks began to specialize in crops that they could market in distant locations  With their profits they purchased manufactured goods that earlier they might have made at home  Before the railroad reached Tennessee  the state produced about 25 000 bushels  or 640 tons  of wheat  which sold for less than 50 cents a bushel  Once the railroad came  farmers in the same counties grew 400 000 bushels  over 10 000 tons  and sold their crop at a dollar a bushel 
      The new railroad networks shifted the direction of western trade  In 1840 most northwestern grain was shipped south down the Mississippi River to the bustling port of New Orleans  But low water made steamboat travel hazardous in summer  and ice shut down traffic in winter  Products such as lard  tallow  and cheese quickly spoiled if stored in New Orleans  hot and humid warehouses  Increasingly  traffic from the Midwest flowed west to east  over the new rail lines  Chicago became the region s hub  linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and other eastern cities by more than 2 000 miles of track in 1855  Thus while the value of goods shipped by river to New Orleans continued to increase  the South s overall share of western trade dropped dramatically 
      A sharp rise in demand for grain abroad also encouraged farmers in the Northeast and Midwest to become more commercially oriented  Wheat  which in 1845 commanded $1 08 a bushel in New York City  fetched $2 46 in 1855  in similar fashion the price of corn nearly doubled  Farmers responded by specializing in cash crops  borrowing to purchase more land  and investing in equipment to increase productivity 
      As railroad lines fanned out from Chicago  farmers began to acquire open prairie land in Illinois and then Iowa  putting the fertile  deep black soil into production  Commercial agriculture transformed this remarkable treeless environment  To settlers accustomed to eastern woodlands  the thousands of square miles of tall grass were an awesome sight  Indian grass  Canada wild rye  and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person  Because eastern plows could not penetrate the densely tangled roots of prairie grass  the earliest settlers erected farms along the boundary separating the forest from the prairie  In 1837  however  John Deere patented a sharp cutting steel plow that sliced through the sod without soil sticking to the blade  Cyrus McCormick refined a mechanical reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same amount of labor  By the 1850s McCormick was selling 1 000 reapers a year and could not keep up with demand  while Deere turned out 10 000 plows annually 
      The new commercial farming fundamentally altered the Midwestern landscape and the environment  Native Americans had grown corn in the region for years  but never in such large fields as did later settlers who became farmers  whose surpluses were shipped east  Prairie farmers also introduced new crops that were not part of the earlier ecological system  notably wheat  along with fruits and vegetables 
      Native grasses were replaced by a small number of plants cultivated as commodities  Corn had the best yields  but it was primarily used to feed livestock  Because bread played a key role in the American and European diet  wheat became the major cash crop  Tame grasses replaced native grasses in pastures for making hay 
      Western farmers altered the landscape by reducing the annual fires that had kept the prairie free from trees  In the absence of these fires  trees reappeared on land not in cultivation and  if undisturbed  eventually formed woodlots  The earlier unbroken landscape gave way to independent farms  each fenced off in a precise checkerboard pattern  It was an artificial ecosystem of animals  woodlots  and crops  whose large  uniform layout made western farms more efficient than the more irregular farms in the East 
 
       1  According to paragraph 1  each of the following is true about railroad track in the United States EXCEPT 
 In 1850 the United State had less than 10 000 miles of railroad track 
 By the end of the 1850s  Ohio and Illinois contained more railroad track than any other state in the country 
 Much of the railroad track built in the United States during the 1850s was located west of the Appalachian Mountain 
 By 1860 there were more miles of railroad track in the United States than in any other country 

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the new railroads had which of the following effects on farm communities 
 Most new farms were located along the tracks 
 Farmers began to grow wheat as a commercial corp 
 Many farmer decided to grow a wider variety of crops 
 Demand for manufactured goods increased among famers 

3  The word  bustling  in the passage is closest in meaning to
         famous
         important
  growing 
         busy

4  According to paragraph 3  in what way did the new rail networks change western trade 
 Northwestern farmers almost completely stopped shipping goods by steamboat 
 Many western goods began to be shipped east by way of Chicago rather than south to New Orleans 
 Chicago largely replaced New York and other eastern cities as the final market for goods for the West 
 The value of goods shipped west soon became greater than the value of goods shipped east 

5  According to paragraph 3  what was a disadvantage of shipping goods from northwestern areas to New Orleans 
 There was no reliable way to get goods from New Orleans to eastern cities 
 The cost of shipping goods by river to New Orleans continued to increase 
 Goods shipped from New Orleans  neighboring areas had a significant competitive advantage because of their lower transportation costs 
 the temperatures and humidity 
6  Paragraph 4 supports the idea that the price of wheat more than doubled between 1845 and 1855 because
 the price of corn nearly doubled during that same period
 demand for grain increased sharply outside the United States
 farmers in the Northeast and Midwest began to specialize in cash crops
 many farmers had borrowed heavily to purchase land and equipment for raising wheat

 To provide a reason why people from the eastern woodlands of the United States were impressed when they saw the prairie
 To identify an obstacles to the development of the railroad lines fanning out from Chicago
 To explain why the transformation of the prairies by commercial agriculture was so remarkable
 To provide evidence supporting the claim that the prairies had fertile  deep black soil

10  According to paragraph 5  the first settlers generally did not farm open prairie land because
         they could not plow it effectively with the tools that were available
  prairie land was usually very expensive to buy
         the soil along boundaries between the forest and the prairie was more fertile than the soil of the open prairie
         the railroad lines had not yet reached the open prairie when the first settlers arrived

 Reducing annual fires
 Dividing the land into large  regularly shaped lots
 Planting trees that eventually formed woodlots
 Fencing off their farms

The huge expansion of rail lines in Midwestern United States during the 1850s had major economic and environmental effects 

 
 
 
 

Answer Choices
  Construction of new rail lines into the Midwest had been effectively stopped by the Appalachian Mountains  but by 1850 improved construction technology had made further advances possible 
  Rail lines to Chicago and on to the East made it easier to get Midwestern goods to distant markets  while growing demand encouraged crop specialization and led to higher crop prices 
  Because of the growing volume of traffic coming by rail from the Northeast and Midwest  the value of goods arriving in New Orleans for shipment to markets abroad increased dramatically 
 Access to rail lines combined with the development of more efficient farming equipment allowed a fertile land of the open prairies to be used for large scale commercial agriculture 
 Reduction of annual prairie fires allowed trees to reappear  and native grasses were replaced by a few commercially grown plants as previously unbroken grasslands were divided into large fenced fields 
 Native Americans had grown corn on the prairies for years but had not produced large surpluses because the varieties they planted had far poorer yields than those introduced by commercial farmers 


 




 
Extinction Episodes of the Past
 It was not until the Cambrian period  beginning about 600 million years ago  that a great proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to track the rise and fall of biodiversity  Since the Cambrian period  biodiversity has generally risen  but there have been some notable exceptions  Biodiversity collapsed dramatically during at least five periods because of mass extinctions around the globe  The five major mass extinctions receive most of the attention  but they are only one end of a spectrum of extinction events  Collectively  more species went extinct during smaller events that were less dramatic but more frequent  The best known of the five major extinction events  the one that saw the demise of the dinosaurs  is the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction 

Starting about 280 million years ago  reptiles were the dominant large animals in terrestrial environments  In popular language this was the era  when dinosaurs ruled Earth   when a wide variety of reptile species occupying many ecological niches  However  no group or species can maintain its dominance indefinitely  and when  after over 200 million years  the age of dinosaurs came to a dramatic end about 65 million years ago  mammals began to flourish  evolving from relatively few types of small terrestrial animals into the myriad of diverse species  including bats and whales  that we know today  Paleontologists label this point in Earth s history as the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Tertiary period  often abbreviated as the K T boundary  This time was also marked by changes in many other types of organisms  Overall  about 38 percent of the families of marine animals were lost  with percentages much higher in some groups Ammonoid mollusks went from being very diverse and abundant to being extinct  An extremely abundant set of planktonic marine animals called foraminifera largely disappeared  although they rebounded later  Among plants  the K T boundary saw a sharp but brief rise in the abundance of primitive vascular plants such as ferns  club mosses  horsetails  and conifers and other gymnosperms  The number of flowering plants  angiosperms  was reduced at this time  but they then began to increase dramatically 

 What caused these changes  For many years scientists assumed that a cooling of the climate was responsible  with dinosaurs being particularly vulnerable because  like modern reptiles  they were ectothermic  dependent on environmental heat  or cold blooded   It is now widely believed that at least some species of dinosaurs had a metabolic rate high enough for them to be endotherms  animals that maintain a relatively consistent body temperature by generating heat internally   Nevertheless  climatic explanations for the K T extinction are not really challenged by the ideas that dinosaurs may have been endothermic  because even endotherms can be affected by a significant change in the climate 

Explanations for the K T extinction were revolutionized in 1980 when a group of physical scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed that 65 million years ago Earth was stuck by a 10 kilometer wide meteorite traveling at 90 000 kilometers per hour  They believed that this impact generated a thick cloud of dust that enveloped Earth  shutting out much of the incoming solar radiation and reducing plant photosynthesis to very low levels  Short term effects might have included huge tidal waves and extensive fires  In other words  a series of events arising from a single cataclysmic event caused the massive extinctions  Initially  the meteorite theory was based on a single line of evidence  At locations around the globe  geologists had found an unusually high concentration of iridium in the layer of sedimentary rocks that was formed about 65 million years ago  Iridium is an element that is usually uncommon near Earth s surface  but it is abundant in some meteorites  Therefore  Alvarez and his colleagues concluded that it was likely that the iridium in sedimentary rocks deposited at the K T boundary had originated in a giant meteorite or asteroid  Most scientist came to accept the meteorite theory after evidence came to light that a circular formation  180 kilometers in diameter in diameter and centered on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula  was created by a meteorite impact about 65 million years ago

 To argue that there was a significant climate at the time that endothermic dinosaurs became extinct
 To argue that climate change caused some dinosaurs to evolve as endotherms
 To support the view that at least some of the dinosaurs that became extinct were endotherms

 It provided evidence that overexposure to solar radiation led to the K T extinction 
 It showed that more than one cataclysmic event was responsible for the K T extinction 
 It suggested that the cause of the K T extinction may have been a meteorite striking Earth 
 It provided evidence that the K T extinction occurred 65 million years ago 

11  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true about the Yucatan Peninsula

 Sedimentary rocks from that area have the lowest iridium concentration of any rocks on Earth 
 There is evidence that a huge tidal wave occurred there 65 million years ago 
 Evidence found there challenged the meteorite impact theory 

12  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about the meteorite theory

The K t extinction 65 million years ago is the best known of the five major extinction episodes since the Cambrian period 

 
 
 


Answer Choices
 Collectively  the five major extinction episodes resulted in the elimination of a larger number of  species than did all the minor extinction events 
 The K T extinction eliminated the dinosaurs and Ammonoid mollusks but was followed by the diversification of mammals and gymnospermous plants 
 An extreme cooling of the climate could not have caused the K T extinction of dinosaurs  because  while most dinosaurs depended on environmental heat  some did not 
 The K T extinction of the dinosaurs is the only mass extinction that has been explained by the impact of a meteorite 
 In1980 Luis Alvarez proposed that the K T extinction was caused by ecological disasters brought about by the impact of a meteorite striking Earth 
 A high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rocks at the K T boundary and a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula from 65 million years ago strongly support Alvarez  hypothesis

Islamic Art and the Book
      The arts of the Islamic book  such as calligraphy and decorative drawing  developed during A D  900 to 1500  and luxury books are some of the most characteristic examples of Islamic art produced in this period  This came about from two major developments  paper became common  replacing parchment as the major medium for writing  and rounded scripts were regularized and perfected so that they replaced the angular scripts of the previous period  which because of their angularity were uneven in height  Books became major vehicles for artistic expression  and the artists who produced them  notably calligraphers and painters  enjoyed high status  and their workshops were often sponsored by princes and their courts  Before A D  900  manuscripts of the Koran  the book containing the teachings of the Islamic religion  seem to have been the most common type of book produced and decorated  but after that date a wide range of books were produced for a broad spectrum of patrons  These continued to include  of course  manuscripts of the Koran  which every Muslim wanted to read  but scientific works  histories  romances  and epic and lyric poetry were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations  Most were made for sale on the open market  and cities boasted special souks  markets  where books were bought and sold  The mosque of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the Kutubiyya  or Booksellers  Mosque  after the adjacent market  Some of the most luxurious books were specific commissions made at the order of a particular prince and signed by the calligrapher and decorator 
      Papermaking had been introduced to the Islamic lands from China in the eighth century  It has been said that Chinese papermakers were among the prisoners captured in a battle fought near Samarqand between the Chinese and the Muslims in 751  and the technique of papermaking   in which cellulose pulp extracted from any of several plants is first suspended in water  caught on a fine screen  and then dried into flexible sheets   slowly spread westward  Within fifty years  the government in Baghdad was using paper for documents  Writing in ink on paper  unlike parchment  could not easily be erased  and therefore paper had the advantage that it was difficult to alter what was written on it  Papermaking spread quickly to Egypt   and eventually to Sicily and Spain   but it was several centuries before paper supplanted parchment for copies of the Koran  probably because of the conservative nature of religious art and its practitioners  In western Islamic lands  parchment continued to be used for manuscripts of the Koran throughout this period 
      The introduction of paper spurred a conceptual revolution whose consequences have barely been explored  Although paper was never as cheap as it has become today  it was far less expensive than parchment  and therefore more people could afford to buy books  Paper is thinner than parchment  so more pages could be enclosed within a single volume  At first  paper was made in relatively small sheets that were pasted together  but by the beginning of the fourteenth century  very large sheets   as much as a meter across   were available 

      These large sheets meant that calligraphers and artists had more space on which to work  Paintings became more complicated  giving the artist greater opportunities to depict space or emotion  The increased availability of paper  particularly after 1250  encouraged people to develop systems of representation  such as architectural plans and drawings  This in turn allowed the easy transfer of artistic ideas and motifs over great distances from one medium to another  and in a different scale in ways that had been difficult  if not impossible  in the previous period  Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long been used for correspondence and documents alongside the formal angular scripts used for inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran  Around the year 900  Ibn Muqla  who was a secretary and vizier at the Abbasid court in Baghdad  developed a system of proportioned writing  He standardized the length of alif  the first letter of the Arabic alphabet  and then determined what the size and shape of all other letters should be  based on the alif  Eventually  six round forms of handwriting  composed of three pairs of big and little scripts known collectively as the Six Pens  became the standard repertory of every calligrapher 

1  Paragraph 1 makes all of the following points about Islamic books EXCEPT 
  Books were an important form of artistic expression 
  A wide variety of books with different styles and topics became available 
  They were sold primarily near mosques 
  Most books were intended for sale on the open market

  It was several centuries before papermaking techniques spread to faraway areas where parchment was popular and used widely in art 
  Although papermaking came to Egypt quickly  it took much longer for paper to be used when copying the Koran  probably because of the conservative nature of religious art 
  Papermaking spread beyond Egypt  Sicily  and Spain  but it was not widely used by artists for centuries  probably because of the conservative nature of art in those countries 
  Paper replaced parchment in copies of the Koran  probably at the request of conservative practitioners in areas like Egypt  Sicily  and Spain 

8  In paragraphs 2 and 3  which of the following is NOT mentioned as an advantage of paper over parchment 
  It was harder to erase or change what was written on paper 
  More pages of paper could be bound in a single volume 
  Paper could be produced in sheets of varying weights and thicknesses 
  More people could buy books made of paper because it was cheaper 

9  Why does the author include the following information   At first  paper was made in relatively small sheets that were pasted together  but by the beginning of the fourteenth century  very large sheets   as much as a meter across   were available   
  To provide evidence that the development of papermaking techniques was very slow
  To explain why paper was never as cheap as it has become today
  To make the point that paper allowed artists to develop paintings that were more expressive and complex
  To prove that paper was more popular with artists who used large sheets  than it was with book printers  who used smaller sheets
10  According to paragraph 3  the increased availability of paper and the development of systems of representation
  encourage more people to make their own drawings
  made the transfer of artistic ideas to distant people and places much easier
  made architectural plans more complex and therefore harder to read
  allowed artists to create paintings that were smaller in scale

11  According to paragraph 4  what did Ibn Muqla achieve around the year 900 
  He modified a set of formal scripts known as the Six Pens into rounded scripts appropriate        for correspondence 
  He created a standardized set of rounded scripts proportional to the size of the first letter of the alphabet 
  He promoted calligraphy as an art form and encouraged the use of rounded letters in religious texts

Answer Choices
  Books became major vehicle of artistic expression for calligraphers and painters  and the subjects of books expanded to include more and more kinds of works 
  The growing luxuriousness of books meant that the market for them was increasingly dominated by the wealthy and powerful patrons who could afford them 
  After it was learned from Chinese prisoners  the technique of papermaking spread throughout Islamic lands  where paper gradually replaced parchment 
  The high status enjoyed by calligraphers and artists made books extremely popular in the cities where books were bought and sold 
  The popularity of books led to major advances in the development and transfer of new artistic ideas 
  Around the year 900  a set of rounded styles of Arabic handwriting began replacing angular scripts in copying the manuscripts of the Koran  







The Development of Steam Power
By the eighteenth century  Britain was experiencing a severe shortage of energy  Because of the growth of population  most of the great forests of medieval Britain had long ago been replaced by fields of grain and hay  Wood was in ever shorter supply  yet it remained tremendously important  It served as the primary source of heat for all homes and industries and as a basic raw material  Processed wood  charcoal  was the fuel that was mixed with iron ore in the blast furnace to produce pig iron  raw iron   The iron industry s appetite for wood was enormous  and by 1740 the British iron industry was stagnating  Vast forests enabled Russia to become the world s leading producer of iron  much of which was exported to Britain  But Russia s potential for growth was limited too  and in a few decades Russia would reach the barrier of inadequate energy that was already holding England back 

As this early energy crisis grew worse  Britain looked toward its abundant and widely scattered reserves of coal as an alternative to its vanishing wood  Coal was first used in Britain in the late Middle Ages as a source of heat  By 1640 most homes in London were heated with it  and it also provided heat for making beer  glass  soap  and other products  Coal was not used  however  to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery  It was there that coal s potential wad enormous 

As more coal was produced  mines were dug deeper and deeper and were constantly filling with water  Mechanical pumps  usually powered by hundreds of horses waling in circles at the surface  had to be installed  Such power was expensive and bothersome  In an attempt to overcome these disadvantages  Thomas Savery in 1698 and Thomas Newcomen in 1705 invented the first primitive steam engines  Both engines were extremely inefficient  Both burned coal to produce steam  which was then used to operate a pump  However  by the early 1770s  many of the Savery engines and hundreds of the Newcomen engines were operating successfully  though inefficiently  in English and Scottish mines 

In the early 1760s  a gifted young Scot named James Watt was drawn to a critical study of the steam engine  Watt was employed at the time by the University of Glasgow as a skilled crafts worker making scientific instruments  In 1763  Watt was called on to repair a Newcomen engine being used in a physics course  After a series of observations  Watt saw that the new comen s waste of energy could be reduced by adding a separate condenser  This splendid invention  patented in 1769  greatly increased the efficiency of the steam engine  The steam engine of Watt and his followers was the technological advance that gave people  at least for a while  unlimited power and allowed the invention and use of all kinds of power equipment 


The steam engine was quickly put to use in several industries in Britain  It drained mines and made possible the production of ever more coal to feed steam engines elsewhere  The steam power plant began to replace waterpower in the cotton spinning mills as well as other industries during the 1780s  contributing to a phenomenal rise in industrialization  The British iron industry was radically transformed  The use of powerful  steam driven bellows in blast furnaces helped iron makers switch over rapidly from limited charcoal to unlimited coke  which is made from coal  in the smelting of pig iron  the process of refining impure iron  after 1770 in the 1780s  Henry Cort developed the puddling furnace  which allowed pig iron to be refined in turn with coke  Cort also developed heavy duty  steam powered rolling mills  which were capable of producing finished iron in every shape and form 

The economic consequence of these technical innovations in steam power was a great boom in the British iron industry  In 1740 annual British iron production was only 17 000 tons  but by 1844  with the spread of coke smelting and the impact of Cort s inventions  it had increased to 3 000 000 tons  This was a truly amazing expansion  Once scarce and expensive  iron became cheap  basic  and indispensable to the economy 

1  What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about Britain s short supply of wood in the eighteenth century 
  Wood from Britain s great forests was being exported to other countries for profit 
  A growing population had required cutting down forests to increase available land for farming 
  Larger families required the construction of larger homes made from wood 
  What was left of the great forests after the medieval period was being strictly protected 

2  Select TWO answer choices that  according to paragraph 1  are true statements about Russia s iron industry in the eighteenth century  To obtain credit  you must select TWO answer choices 
  Russia reached its maximum production of iron at the same time as Britain 
  Russia exported much of its iron production to Britain 
  Russia s appetite for iron increased rapidly after 1740 
  Russia s energy resources eventually became insufficient and limited the growth of its iron industry

  To emphasize that after 1640  British homes required energy for more than heat
  To indicate that coal had been used for the production of certain products before the eighteenth century



5  According to paragraph 3  all of the following are ways in which the Savery and Newcomen engines were similar EXCEPT 
  Both became relatively inexpensive after the 1770s

  To contrast the amounts of iron needed in Britain in two different centuries
  To illustrate how easy it was to make money using Cort s invention
  To demonstrate the tremendous growth of the iron industry in Britain
  To demonstrate how inexpensive coal had become

11  The word  indispensable  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  advantageous

12  According to the passage  which of the following is true about the development of steam power 
  The steam engine s basic technology can be traced back to medieval Britain when steam powered machinery  was being tried in farming activities 
  Although Russia and Britain developed steam power technology simultaneously  Britain was first to try it in a large scale industry due to a greater need for iron 
  Steam power technology was largely the result of improvements developed to increase the supply of coal as a primary source of energy 
  Adaptations to steam engines required for their use in cotton spinning mills led to radical developments in machinery used in the iron industry 



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage 
Energy had not been a problem for Britain in the past because it relied on a rich source of energy  its vast forests 
Where does the sentence best fit

     By the eighteenth century  Britain was experiencing a severe shortage of energy 

 
 
     

Answer Choices
  The development of blast furnaces for the manufacture of pig iron made the Britain less dependent on wood 
  After the medieval period  both Russia and Britain began to look for alternative sources of energy  such as steam power  in order to maintain the growth of their iron industries 
  Two inventors designed the first steam engines in order to overcome the disadvantages of relying on horses to power the pumps used in mining coal 
  James Watt was able to improve upon the efficiency of the steam engine and make it useful to several industries 
  The puddling furnace increased the availability of charcoal to a variety of industries from cotton to iron production 
  Steam power increased coal production  which in turn allowed extraordinary growth of the iron industry and the British economy 







Protection of Plants by Insects
       Many plants   one or more species of at least 68 different families   can secrete nectar even when they have no blossoms  because they bear extrafloral nectaries  structures that produce nectar  on stems  leaves  leaf stems  or other structures  These plants usually occur where ants are abundant  most in the tropics but some in temperate areas  Among those of northeastern North America are various plums  cherries  roses  hawthorns  poplars  and oaks  Like floral nectar  extrafloral nectar consists mainly of water with a high content of dissolved sugars and  in some plants  small amounts of amino acids  The extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to attract ants and other insects  but the evolutionary history of most plants with these nectaries is unknown  Nevertheless  most ecologists believe that all extrafloral nectaries attract insects that will defend the plant  

     Ants are portably the most frequent and certainly the most persistent defenders of plants  Since the highly active worker ants require a great deal of energy  plants exploit this need by providing extrafloral nectar that supplies ants with abundant energy  To return this favor  ants guard the nectaries  driving away or killing intruding insects that might compete with ants for nectar  Many of these intruders are herbivorous and would eat the leaves of the plants  

      Biologists once thought that secretion of extrafloral nectar has some purely internal physiological function  and that ants provide no benefit whatsoever to the plants that secrete it  This view and the opposing  protectionist  hypothesis that ants defend plants had been disputed for over a hundred years when  in 1910  a skeptical William Morton Wheeler commented on the controversy  He called for proof of the protectionist view  that visitations of the ants confer protection on the plants and that in the absence of the insects a much greater number would perish or fail to produce flowers or seeds than when the insects are present  That we now have an abundance of the proof that was called for was established when Barbara Bentley reviewed the relevant evidence in 1977  and since then many more observations and experiments have provided still further proof that ants benefit plants 

     One example shows how ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries protect morning glories against attacking insects  The principal insect enemies of the North American morning glory feed mainly on its flowers or fruits rather than its leaves  Grasshoppers feeding on flowers indirectly block pollination and the production of seeds by destroying the corolla or the stigma  which receives the pollen grains and on which the pollen germinates  Without their colorful corolla  flowers do not attract pollinators and are not fertilized  An adult grasshopper can consume a large corolla  about 2 5 inches long  in an hour  Caterpillars and seed beetles affect seed production directly  Caterpillars devour the ovaries  where the seeds are produced  and seed beetle larvae eat seeds as they burrow in developing fruits  

      Extrafloral nectaries at the base of each sepal attract several kinds of insects  but 96 percent of them are ants  several different species of them  When buds are still small  less than a quarter of an inch long  the sepal nectaries are already present and producing nectar  They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures  Observations leave little doubt that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers  caterpillars  and seed beetles  Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants  Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant  but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant  Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers  they drive them away by nipping at their feet  Seed beetles are more vulnerable because they are much smaller than grasshoppers  The ants prey on the adult beetles  disturb females as they lay their eggs on developing fruits  and eat many of the eggs they do manage to lay

  they are likely to be produced by the same plants
  they basically consist of the same chemical components
  they attract only insects that will defend the plant
  they are produced by the same parts of the plant

2  To say that ants are  persistent  defenders of plants means that
  they defend plants against a wide variety of threats
  they continue to defend plants for as long as the plants are threatened
  they are successful defenders of plants
  they are easily observable defenders of plants

3  What can be inferred from paragraph 2 about the ants that are attracted to the extrafloral nectaries 
  They do not eat the leaves of the plants that produce extrafloral nectar 
  They live almost entirely on extrafloral nectar 
  They spend most of their energy guarding extrafloral nectaries 
  They frequently fight among themselves over extrafloral nectar 


4  According to paragraph 3  what was the position of the opponents of the  protectionist  hypothesis 
  Extrafloral nectar provides plants with a direct defense against attack by insects 
  Ants substantially benefit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar 
  The secretion of extrafloral nectar plays a role in the plant s internal functioning 
  Ants visit plants that secrete extrafloral nectar as often as they visit plants that do not

  The plants occupied by ants produced many more seeds than those that were not occupied by ants 
  The plants that grew in places without ants were much smaller and weaker than those that grew in places where ants were present 

12  According to paragraph 5  ants defend morning glory plants from seed beetles in each of the following ways EXCEPT
  driving adult beetles off the plants by nipping at their feet

     Many plants have extrafloral nectaries that produce nectar even during periods in which the plant is not flowering 
 
 
       

Answer Choices
  Evolutionary history shows that plants that produce extrafloral nectar originated in the tropics 
  Extrafloral nectar has a higher concentration of sugar than floral nectar and is more attractive to ants and other insects 
  The protectionist hypothesis is that extrafloral nectar attracts ants  and that the ants  in order to preserve this energy rich food source  attack insects that might harm the plant 
  Evidence accumulated during the twentieth century proved that ants provide significant benefits for plants with extrafloral nectaries 
  Research has shown that American morning glory plants that are protected by ants produce significantly more seeds than morning glory plants that are not protected by ants 
  Ants generally ignore small insects  but they will eat the adults of large insect species as well as their eggs and larvae 











TPO 35
Europe in the twelfth century
Europe in the eleventh century underwent enormous social  technological  and economic changes  but this did not create a new Europe it created two new ones  The north was developed as a rigidly hierarchical society in which status was determined  or was at least indicated  by the extent to which one owned  controlled  or labored on land  whereas the Mediterranean south developed a more fluid  and therefore more chaotic  world in which industry and commerce predominated and social status both reflected and resulted from the role that one played in the public life of the community  In other words  individual identity and social community in the north were established on a personal basis  whereas in the south they were established on a civic basis   By the start of the twelfth century  northern and southern Europe were very different places indeed  and the Europeans themselves noticed it and commented on it  

Political dominance belonged to the north  Germany  France  and England had large populations and large armies that made them  in the political and military senses  the masters of Western Europe  Organized by the practices known collectively as feudalism   these kingdoms emerged as powerful states with sophisticated machineries of government  Their kings and queens were the leading figures of the age  their castles and cathedrals stood majestically on the landscape as symbols of their might  their armies both energized and defined the age  Moreover  feudal society showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new needs by encouraging the parallel development of domestic urban life and commercial networks  in some regions of the north  in fact  feudal society may even have developed in response to the start of the trends toward bigger cities  But southern Europe took the lead in economic and cultural life  Though the leading Mediterranean states were small in size  they were considerably wealthier than their northern counterparts  The Italian city of Palermo in the twelfth century  for example  alone generated four times the commercial tax revenue of the entire kingdom of England  Southern communities also possessed urbane  multilingual cultures that made them the intellectual and artistic leaders of the age  Levels of general literacy in the south far surpassed those of the north  and the people of the south put that learning to use on a large scale  Science  mathematics  poetry  law  historical writing  religious speculation  translation  and classical studies all began to flourish  throughout most of the twelfth century  most of the continent s best brains flocked to southern Europe 

So too did a lot of the north s soldiers  One of the central themes of the political history of the twelfth century was the continual effort by the northern kingdoms to extend their control southward in the hope of tapping into the Mediterranean bonanza  The German emperors starting with Otto I  936 973   for example  struggled ceaselessly to establish their control over the cities of northern Italy  since those cities generated more revenue than all of rural Germany combined  The kings of France used every means at their disposal to push the lower border of their kingdom to the Mediterranean shoreline  And the Normans who conquered and ruled England established outposts of Norman power in Sicily and the adjacent lands of southern Italy  the English kings also hoped or claimed at various times to be  either through money or marriage diplomacy  the rulers of several Mediterranean states  But as the northern world pressed southward  so too did some of the cultural norms and social mechanisms of the south expand northward  Over the course of the twelfth century  the feudal kingdoms witnessed a proliferation of cities modeled in large degree on those of the south  Contact with the merchants and financiers of the Mediterranean led to the development of northern industry and international trade  which helped to pay for many of the castles and cathedrals mentioned earlier   And education spread as well  culminating in the foundation of what is arguably medieval Europe s greatest invention  the university  The relationship of north and south was symbiotic  in other words  and the contrast between them was more one of differences in degree than of polar opposition

Population and climate
The human population on Earth has grown to the point that it is having an effect on Earth s atmosphere and ecosystems  Burning of fossil fuels  deforestation  urbanization  cultivation of rice and cattle  and the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons  CFCs  for propellants and refrigerants are increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide  methane  nitrogen oxides  sulphur oxides  dust  and CFCs in the atmosphere  About 70 percent of the Sun s energy passes through the atmosphere and strikes Earth s surface  This radiation heats the surface of the land and ocean  and these surfaces then reradiate infrared radiation back into space  This allows Earth to avoid heating up too much  However  not all of the infrared radiation makes it into space  some is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere and is reradiated back to Earth s surface  A greenhouse gas is one that absorbs infrared radiation and then reradiates some of this radiation back to Earth  Carbon dioxide  CFCs  methane  and nitrogen oxides are greenhouse gases  The natural greenhouse effect of our atmosphere is well established  In fact  without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  scientists calculate that Earth would be about 33°C cooler than it currently is 

The current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 360 parts per million  Human activities are having a major influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations  which are rising so fast that current predictions are that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will double in the next 50 to 100 years  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC  report in 1992  which represents a consensus of most atmospheric scientists  predicts that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration would raise global temperatures anywhere between 1 4° C and 4 5°C  The IPCC report issued in 2001 raised the temperature prediction almost twofold  The suggested rise in temperature is greater than the changes that occurred in the past between ice ages  The increase in temperatures would not be uniform  with the smallest changes at the equator and changes two or three times as great at the poles  The local effects of these global changes are difficult to predict  but it is generally agreed that they may include alterations in ocean currents  increased winter flooding in some areas of the Northern Hemisphere  a higher incidence of summer 

Scientists are actively investigating the feedback mechanism within the physical  chemical  and biological components of Earth s climate system in order to make accurate predictions of the effects the rise in greenhouse gases will have on future global climates  Global circulation models are important tools in this process  These models incorporate current knowledge on atmospheric circulation patterns  ocean currents  the effect of landmasses  and the like to predict climate under changed conditions  There are several models  and all show agreement on a global scale  For example  all models show substantial changes in climate when carbon dioxide concentration is doubled  However  there are significant differences in the regional climates predicted by different models  Most models project greater temperature increases in mid latitude regions and in mid continental regions relative to the global average  Additionally  changes in precipitation patterns are predicted  with decreases in mid latitude regions and increased rainfall in some tropical areas  Finally  most models predict that there will be increased occurrences of extreme events  such as extended periods without rain  drought   extreme heat waves  greater seasonal variation in temperatures  and increases in the frequency and magnitude of severe storms  Plants and animals have strong responses to virtually every aspect of these projected global changes 

The challenge of predicting organismal responses to global climate change is difficult  Partly  this is due to the fact that there are more studies of short term  individual organism responses than there are of long term  systemwide studies  It is extremely difficult  both monetarily and physically  for scientists to conduct field studies at spatial and temporal scales that are large enough to include all the components of real world systems  especially ecosystems with large  freely ranging organisms  One way paleobiologists try to get around this limitation is to attempt to reconstruct past climates by examining fossil life 

The relative roles that abiotic and biotic factors play in the distribution of organisms is especially important now  when the world is confronted with the consequences of a growing human population  Changes in climate  land use  and habitat destruction are currently causing dramatic decreases in biodiversity throughout the world  An understanding of climate organism relationships is essential to efforts to preserve and manage Earth s biodiversity

What is a community 
The Black Hills forest  the prairie riparian forest  and other forests of the western United States can be separated by the distinctly different combinations of species they comprise  It is easy to distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest one is a broad leaved forest of ash and cottonwood trees  the other is a coniferous forest of ponderosa pine and white spruce trees  One has kingbirds  the other juncos  birds with white outer tail feathers   The fact that ecological communities are indeed  recognizable clusters of species led some early ecologists  particularly those living in the beginning of the twentieth century  to claim that communities are highly integrated  precisely balanced assemblages  This claim harkens back to even earlier arguments about the existence of a balance of nature  where every species is there for a specific purpose  like a vital part in a complex machine  Such a belief would suggest that to remove any species  whether it be plant  bird  or insect  would somehow disrupt the balance  and the habitat would begin to deteriorate  Likewise  to add a species may be equally disruptive 

One of these pioneer ecologists was Frederick Clements  who studied ecology extensively throughout the Midwest and other areas in North America  He held that within any given region of climate  ecological communities tended to slowly converge toward a single endpoint  which he called the  climatic climax   This  climax  community was  in Clements s mind  the most well balanced  integrated grouping of species that could occur within that particular region  Clements even thought that the process of ecological succession the replacement of some species by others over time was somewhat akin to the development of an organism  from embryo to adult  Clements thought that succession represented discrete stages in the development of the community  rather like infancy  childhood  and adolescence   terminating in the climatic  adult  stage  when the community became self reproducing and succession ceased  Clements s view of the ecological community reflected the notion of a precise balance of nature 

Clements was challenged by another pioneer ecologist  Henry Gleason  who took the opposite view  Gleason viewed the community as largely a group of species with similar tolerances to the stresses imposed by climate and other factors typical of the region  Gleason saw the element of chance as important in influencing where species occurred  His concept of the community suggests that nature is not highly integrated  Gleason thought succession could take numerous directions  depending upon local circumstances 

Who was right  Many ecologists have made precise measurements  designed to test the assumptions of both the Clements and Gleason models  For instance  along mountain slopes  does one life zone  or habitat type  grade sharply or gradually into another  If the divisions are sharp  perhaps the reason is that the community is so well integrated  so holistic  so like Clements viewed it  that whole clusters of species must remain together  If the divisions are gradual  perhaps  as Gleason suggested  each species is responding individually to its environment  and clusters of species are not so integrated that they must always occur together 

It now appears that Gleason was far closer to the truth than Clements  The ecological community is largely an accidental assemblage of species with similar responses to a particular climate  Green ash trees are found in association with plains cottonwood trees because both can survive well on floodplains and the competition between them is not so strong that only one can persevere  One ecological community often flows into another so gradually that it is next to impossible to say where one leaves off and the other begins  Communities are individualistic 
This is not to say that precise harmonies are not present within communities  Most flowering plants could not exist were it not for their pollinators and vice versa  Predators  disease organisms  and competitors all influence the abundance and distribution of everything from oak trees to field mice  But if we see a precise balance of nature  it is largely an artifact of our perception  due to the illusion that nature  especially a complex system like a forest  seems so unchanging from one day to the next 


1  In paragraph 1  why does the author distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest 
  To highlight the difference between the views of various ecologists about the nature of ecological communities
  To illustrate why some ecologists tended to view ecological communities as highly integrated
  To demonstrate that one forest has a greater variety of species than the other
  To show how these two forests differ from others in the United States

2  According to paragraph 1  what was a common claim about ecological communities before the early twentieth century 
  Every species in a community has a specific role in that community 
  It is important to protect communities by removing certain species 
  A precise balance is difficult to maintain in an ecological community 
  It is necessary for new species to be added quickly as ecological communities develop 

3  The word  clusters  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  models 
  categories

4  According to paragraph 1  the belief in a balance of nature suggests that removing a species from an ecological community would have which of the following effects 
  It would reduce competition between the remaining species of the community 
  It would produce a different  but equally balanced  community 
  It would lead to a decline in the community 
  It would cause more harm than adding a species to the community 






5  The word  ceased  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  succeeded

6  Which of the following best represents the view of ecological communities associated with Frederick Clements in paragraph 2 
  Only when all species in a community are at the reproductive stage of development is an ecological community precisely balanced 
  When an ecological community achieves  climatic climax   it begins to decline 
  All climates have similar climax communities 
  Ecological communities eventually reach the maximum level of balance that is possible for their region 

7  According to paragraph 2  Clements compared the process of ecological succession to
  the replacement of animal habitats over time
  the development of an organism
  self reproduction
  changes in climate


8  According to Gleason in paragraph 3  the occurrence of a species in a particular community is influenced by
  unpredictable events
  how individualistic the species is
  the number of other species present
  the tolerance of other species to stresses




9  What did the ecologists in paragraph 4 hope to determine with their measurements 
  Whether different species compete for the same environments
  Whether habitats are sharply separated or gradually flow into each other
  Whether succession differs in different types of habitats
  Whether integrated communities survive better than independent communities


10  In paragraph 5  why does the author mention green ash trees and plains cottonwood trees 
  To support the current view about how ecological communities develop 
  To provide an example of species that prefer to live on floodplains 
  To provide evidence that supports the theory of Clements
  To show where one ecological community stops and the other begins

11  The word  persevere  in the passage is closest in meaning to

12  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in paragraph 6  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 
  We see nature as precisely balanced because nature is unchanging 
  A precise balance of nature is not possible because of the complexity of natural systems 
  0ur sense that nature is precisely balanced results from the illusion that it is unchanging 
  Because nature is precisely balanced  complex systems do not seem to change 



13 Look at the four squares   that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage  Where would the sentence best fit

Answer Choices
  Clements held that ecological communities were like organisms that compete with each other for dominance in a particular climatic region 
  Clements saw the community as a collection of thoroughly interdependent species progressing toward a single climax community 
  Gleason held that within a single climatic region  differing local factors would cause ecological communities to develop in different ways
