Protozoa

A protozoan is a tiny single-celled organism. It can move independently. And it can survive in many kinds of environments. In fact, it can live in any place with moisture. A protozoan gets its food by ingesting small molecules or cells from other living things. Scientists have identified around 60,000 types of protozoa. They expect to discover even more in the future.

Some protozoa can live by themselves. They do not require a host. But many do. So they live inside other organisms. These are classified as parasites. Parasites can cause a number of diseases in their hosts. In some cases, the diseases are fatal.

Not all protozoa are harmful.    Many even make up crucial parts of the food chain.     For instance, zooplankton is a protozoan species.      It is a common food for many ocean animals.     Without zooplankton, numerous species of fish would be deprived of a major source of food.
