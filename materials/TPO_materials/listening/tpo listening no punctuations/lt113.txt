TPO11 Lecture 2 Architecture

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Architecture Class

Professor
Today  we are taking a little detour from the grand styles of public architecture we ve been studying to look at residential architectures in the United States  Since this is something we can all identify with  I think it will help us see the relationship between the function of a structure and its style or form  This has been an ongoing theme in our discussions  and we will be getting back to it in just a moment  But before we get started  I want you to take a moment to think  does anyone know what the single most popular style for a house in the United States is today  Bob

Student 1
 I bet it is the ranch style house

Professor
 Well  in this area  probably  But are we typical  Yes  Sue

Student 2
 How about the kind of house my grandparents live in  They call it a Cape
Cod

Professor
That s the one  Here is a drawing of what we consider of a classic Cape Cod house  These days  you see this style all over the United States  But it first showed up in U S  northeast  in the New England region  around the late 1600s  For those of you who don t know the northeast coastal region  Cape Cod is a peninsula  a narrow strip of land that jets out into the Atlantic  and so     so  many houses in this particular style were built on Cape Cod  that the name of the place became the name of the style

Now why did the Cape Cod style house become so popular in the northeast  Well  one reason is that it s a great example of form following function  We ve talked about this design principle a lot about form following function  And what did we say it meant  Someone give me an application of this principle  What is this concept that form should follow function  How would it be applied to housing design

Student 2
Well  if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it  Then  well  the architect has to be very practical to think about the people who ll actually be living in the house or working in the office building  whatever  so for the architect  it s all about the users not about showing off how creative you can be

Professor
Good  of course  for a Cape Cod house  it might be even more accurate to say that form also follows climate  Who knows what the climate s like on Cape Cod

Student 1
Cold in the winter…

Student 2
And whenever I visit my grandparents  it s really wet  It s usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy  too  I guess because it s so exposed to the ocean

Professor
That s right  So take another look at this drawing  and you can imagine how this design might be particularly helpful in that kind of climate  Notice how the house sits fairly low to the ground  This relatively low compact structure helps the house withstand the strong winds blowing off the ocean

And look at the
slope of the roof  the steep angle helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter

Another thing  Cape Cod houses usually face south to take advantage of the sun s warm through the windows  That s helpful in winter

Now what can you tell me about the chimney  about its location

Student 2
Well  it s in the middle  Because  does that have something to do with heating the houses  I mean since the heat never has to travel very far

Student 1
That d mean you can heat the house more efficiently  right

Professor
Exactly  now see how the house has very little exterior decoration  that s also typical of early Cape Cod houses  The wind was one reason  nothing sticking out that might blow away in the harsh weather  but there was probably another reason  not related to the climate  more a reflection of rural New England society back then  you see Cape Cod houses were not built in the big cities  where all the rich people lived back then  These were modest dwellings  the people who built them simply couldn t afford lots of expensive decorative details  But it was more than just a matter of money  In these rural areas  people depended on each other for survival  Neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment  so you didn t want to appear to be showing off  You d want to avoid anything that might set you apart from your neighbors  the same people you might need to help you someday  So all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the community  and you can see why a modest  a very plain style would have become so widely imitated throughout rural New England

Student 2
It is plain  but you know its nice looking

Professor
Good point  and in fact it s precisely that aesthetic appeal  the…the purity  the nearly perfect proportions of the house…that s another reason for the Cape Cod s enduring popularity  even in places where the climate is so mild that its functional design doesn t matter
