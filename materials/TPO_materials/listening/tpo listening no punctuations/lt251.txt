Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor

Professor
Hi  Mark  What can I do for you
Student
I am just filling out this approval for graduation form for the dean s office  and I don t know  I hope I will be able to graduate next semester
Professor
Well  as long as you ve met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time  you shouldn t have any problem  Make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance and the electives too
Student
Yeah  but as I look over the form  I got confused because of the way  umâ€¦they ve changed the requirements  So now I am not sure I will be qualified to graduate next semester  I know I would  before  under the old requirements
Professor
Well  when the business department changed the curriculum to include more courses in international business  to     well  because of the increasing globalization of business  We made sure that students who have finished their second year  that is  those who are in their third or fourth year  wouldn t be affected  The new rules only apply to students in their first or second year
Student
That s good to know  Uh    the department s hiring new faculty too I heard  to teach some of the new courses  But I want to
Professor
Yes  One new faculty member has been hired  She will be teaching International Banking as a matter of fact
Student
Actually  that s what I want to ask about   International Banking  I took International Banking l  but I never took International Banking 2  It used to be that the second semester of International Banking was an elective  but now it says it s a required class
Professor
Yes  But that s one of the recent changes  So
Student
Oh  Oh  OK  Oh  And     and I am planning to take a management course next semester  but I don t know if it s     if it will count toward my major
Professor
What s the course
Student
Organizational Behavior
Professor
Yes  That will count toward your major  That s a difficult class  you know  But well worth it  So it looks like you will have all the required classes you need  You should be just fine
Uh    I assume you have taken a seminar
Student
Yeah  I took the marketing seminar
Professor
OK  You are looking good  Just to be on the safe side  why don t you talk to someone in the dean s office before you give them the form
Student
OK  So should I just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class  I don t have to take it
Professor
Yes  You ve met the requirements for graduation  And if there s something I need to do     if I need to write a letter or whatever  just let me know
Student
OK  Thanks  I ll let you know if I need that letter
