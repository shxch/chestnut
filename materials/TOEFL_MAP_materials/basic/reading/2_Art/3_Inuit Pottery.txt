Inuit Pottery

The Inuit people live in the northern parts of Canada and Alaska. They have their own unique culture. Part of it once involved the making of pottery. These days, the Inuit do not often make ceramics. The frozen Arctic does not have many places that contain the clay required to make pottery. 

The Inuit people mostly used woven baskets or ones made of animal hides to carry things. They made most of their artwork from wood, bone, soapstone, and jade. There is also evidence that they made pottery in the past.    In the 1820s, some Arctic explorers discovered a tribe of Inuits using clay pottery.    Later, archaeologists found some pottery in another part of the Arctic.    They believe an extinct people called the Thule made it.    Nowadays, some Inuits are trying to revive the lost art of pottery making. They face an uphill battle to do so.
