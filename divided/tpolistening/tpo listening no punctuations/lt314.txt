Conversation2  Credits for Internship
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university center for off campus study
Student
Hi  I am Tom Arnold  I am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research  I am doing an internship there this summer
Employee
Yes  I have it right here  The mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago
Student
Thanks  Um…I wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship  I don t know if…
Employee
I might be able to help you with that  Is there a problem
Student
I just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected  The system should show that I am registered to earn four credits  But as of Friday  nothing was showing up yet  I was told it would be fixed this morning
Employee
Well  I can check on the computer for you  Tom Arnold  right
Student
Yes
Employee
Well  it is showing credits…but only three
Student
Really   So now what  These all have to be finalized last week
Employee
Well  yes  The course enrollment period ended last week  But since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for you before then… Let me see what I can do
Uh…did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship  Because the other students at the center for marine research are only getting three
Student
Um…I am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center s aquarium  taking classes in marine biology and then teaching visitors about the various displays  I am doing a special research internship with the center  We ll be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean
Employee
Oh  That sounds quite advanced
Student
Well  the internship requires me to have scuba diving certification and to be a senior oceanography student  I want to do advanced study in oceanography when I graduate  So I really want to get a sense of what real research is like
Employee
I see  Now let s try and see if we can… Oh  OK  I see the problem  There are two kinds of internships listed here regular and research  Yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits
Student
Can you switch it
Employee
Not yet  But it lists Professor Leonard as…
Student
She is in charge of all the internships
Employee
She just needs to send an email so I have an official record  Then I can switch it  And that should solve everything
Student
Great  And I know Professor Leonard is in her office this afternoon  so I can go there later  It will be such a relief to get all these paperwork completed
