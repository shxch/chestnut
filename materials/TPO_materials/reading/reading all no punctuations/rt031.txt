Architecture
Architecture is the art and science of designing structures that organize and enclose space for practical and symbolic purposes  Because architecture grows out of human needs and aspirations  it clearly communicates cultural values  Of all the visual arts  architecture affects our lives most directly for it determines the character of the human environment in major ways
Architecture is a three dimensional form  It utilizes space  mass  texture  line  light  and color  To be architecture  a building must achieve a working harmony with a variety of elements  Humans instinctively seek structures that will shelter and enhance their way of life  It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not simply constructions but also offer inspiration and delight  Buildings contribute to human life when they provide shelter  enrich space  complement their site  suit the climate  and are economically feasible  The client who pays for the building and defines its function is an important member of the architectural team  The mediocre design of many contemporary buildings can be traced to both clients and architects
In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose  architecture employs methods of support that  because they are based on physical laws  have changed little since people first discovered them even while building materials have changed dramatically  The world s architectural structures have also been devised in relation to the objective limitations of materials  Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they deal with downward forces created by gravity  They are designed to withstand the forces of compression  pushing together   tension  pulling apart   bending  or a combination of these in different parts of the structure
Even development in architecture has been the result of major technological changes  Materials and methods of construction are integral parts of the design of architecture structures  In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available  such as wood  stone  brick  Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired  Enormous changes in materials and techniques of construction within the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material  Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built now and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago
Modern architectural forms generally have three separate components comparable to elements of the human body  a supporting skeleton or frame  an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces  and equipment  similar to the body s vital organs and systems  The equipment includes plumbing  electrical wiring  hot water  and air conditioning  Of course in early architecture such as igloos and adobe structures there was no such equipment  and the skeleton and skin were often one
Much of the world s great architecture has been constructed of stone because of its beauty  permanence  and availability  In the past  whole cities grew from the arduous task of cutting and piling stone upon  Some of the world s finest stone architecture can be seen in the ruins of the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru  The doorways and windows are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above  A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created  That invention was the arch  a curved structure originally made of separate stone or brick segments  The arch was used by the early cultures of the Mediterranean area chiefly for underground drains  but it was the Romans who first developed and used the arch extensively in aboveground structures  Roman builders perfected the semicircular arch made of separate blocks of stone  As a method of spanning space  the arch can support greater weight than a horizontal beam  It works in compression to divert the weight above it out to the sides  where the weight is borne by the vertical elements on either side of the arch  The arch is among the many important structural breakthroughs that have characterized architecture throughout the centuries

1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following statements about architecture are true EXCEPT
 Architecture is visual art

 Architecture has an indirect effect on life


2  The word  feasible  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 in existence
 without question
 achievable
 most likely

3  The word  enhance  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 protect
 improve
 organize
 match













4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Unchanging physical laws have limited the size and strength of buildings that can be made with materials discovered long ago
 Building materials have changed in order to increase architectural size and strength  but physical laws of structure have not changed
 When people first started to build  the structural methods used to provide strength and size were inadequate because they were not based on physical laws
 Unlike building materials  the methods of support used in architecture have not changed over time because they are based on physical laws
5  The word  devised  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 combined
 created
 introduced
 suggested

6  The word  integral  is closest in meaning to
 essential
 variable
 practical
 independent
  7  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true about materials used in the construction of buildings
 Because new building materials are hard to find  construction techniques have changed very little from past generations
 The availability of suitable building materials no longer limits the types of structures that may be built
 The primary building materials that are available today are wood  stone  and brick
 Architects in earlier times did not have enough building materials to enclose large spaces
8  In paragraph 4  what does the author imply about modern buildings
 They occupy much less space than buildings constructed one hundred years ago
 They are not very different from the building of a few generations ago
 They weigh less in relation to their size than buildings constructed one hundred years ago
 They take a long time to build as a result of their complex construction methods

9  Which of the following correctly characterizes the relationship between the human body and architecture that is described in paragraph 5
 Complex equipment inside buildings is the one element in modern architecture that resembles a component of the human body
 The components in early buildings were similar to three particular elements of the human body
 Modern buildings have components that are as likely to change as the human body is
 In general  modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do


10  The word  arduous  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 difficult
 necessary
 skilled
 shared

11  Why does the author include a description of how the  doorways and windows  of Machu Picchu were constructed
 To indicate that the combined skeletons and skins of the stone buildings of Machu Picchu were similar to igloos and adobe structures
 To indicate the different kinds of stones that had to be cut to build Machu Picchu
 To provide an illustration of the kind of construction that was required before arches were invented
 To explain how ancient builders reduced the amount of time necessary to construct buildings from stone

12．According to paragraph 6  which of the following statements is true of the arch
 The Romans were the first people to use the stone arch
 The invention of the arch allowed new architectural forms to be developed
 The arch worked by distributing the structural load of a building toward the center of the arch
 The Romans followed earlier practices in their use of arches
13．Look at the four squares  █  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
However  some modern architectural designs  such as those using folded plates of concreter or air inflated structures  are again unifying skeleton and skin
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Directions
An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
Architecture uses forms and space to express cultural values







Answer choices

 Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use
 Over the course of the history of building  innovations in material and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves
 Throughout history buildings have been constructed like human bodies  needing distinct  organ  systems in order to function
 Both clients and architects are responsible for the mediocre designs of some modern buildings
 Modern buildings tend to lack the beauty of ancient stone buildings such as those of Machu Picchu
 The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures
