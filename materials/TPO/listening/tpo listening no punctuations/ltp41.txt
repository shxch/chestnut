TRACK 63 TRANSCRIPT

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the campus computer center
Computer center employee
Hi  what can I help you with today
Student
Hi  um  I wanted to you see  the thing is  I don t know much about computers  so I was wondering if  uh  if there s a class or something       so I can learn how to use computers  like to write papers for my classes
Computer center employee
Oh  I see       u m  we don t really offer a course for beginners  since most students already have computing experience  But all the computers in our labs have a general tutorial installed on them  You could just go there and run it
Student
And the tutorial explains everything  I mean  it might sound strange but I ve never used a computer
Computer center employee
Well  all the computer labs on campus are staffed with student assistants  and I m sure that any one of them would be more than willing to get you started
Student
Yeah  That sounds good  But is it expensive
Computer center employee
No  in fact  it won t cost anything  it s one of the services of the computer center
Student
That s great  How do they l mean  how do I get in touch with the student assistants  Should I just go to a computer lab and ask whoever s there
Computer center employee
Sure  you could do that  or I can let you have a list of names of the students who are assistants in the labs  You might know one of them
Student
Actually  I think I d prefer someone I don t know  um  so I can ask dumb questions       Is there anyone you d recommend
Computer center employee
All of our student assistants are really knowledgeable about computers  I mean  they have to be  in order to work in the computer labs       It doesn t mean that they re necessarily good at teaching beginners       but you probably won t be a beginner for very long
Student
Hope not
Computer center employee
And I just thought of something else  The bookstore has a lot of books on computers there might be one for people like you  I mean  people who don t have a lot of experience with computers  I actually bought one for my father so he could learn how to use e mail  basic word processing  that sort of thing and it worked pretty well for him
Student
OK  I II try that  too  And if the bookstore doesn t have it  they can just order it for me
Computer center employee
Right  Now is there anything else I can help you with today
Student
Uh  just the list of names and the times they re working  I d like to get going on this as soon as possible
Computer center employee
Right  Good luck
