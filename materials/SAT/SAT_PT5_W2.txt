Questions 12-22 are based on the following passage.
Thomas Nast, the Crusading Cartoonist
“Stop them pictures!” Legend has it that the corrupt
politician William “Boss” Tweed once used those words
when ordering someone to offer a bribe to Thomas Nast,
an artist who had become famous for cartoons that called
for reforms to end corruption. 12 As a result, Tweed’s
attempt to silence the artist failed, and Nast’s cartoons,
published in magazines like Harper’s Weekly, actually
played a key role in bringing Boss Tweed and his cronies
to justice.
13 There were powerful political organizations in
the 1860s and the 1870s. The organizations were known
as “political machines” and started taking control of city
governments. These political machines were able to pack
legislatures and courts with hand-picked supporters by
purchasing 14 votes, a form of election fraud involving
the exchange of money or favors for votes. Once a
political machine had control of enough important
positions, its members were able to use public funds to
enrich themselves and their friends. Boss Tweed’s
Tammany Hall group, which controlled New York
15 City in the 1860s—stole more than $30 million,

16 Tweed had been elected to a single two-year term in
Congress in 1852. Tammany Hall was so powerful and
17 corrupt that, the New York Times, commented
“There is absolutely nothing . . . in the city which is
beyond the reach of the insatiable gang.”
Given the extent of Tweed’s power, it is remarkable
that a single cartoonist could have played such a
significant role in bringing about his downfall. Nast’s
cartoons depicted Tweed as a great big bloated thief. One
of the artist’s most 18 famous images showed Tweed
with a bag of money in place of his 19 head. Another
featured Tweed leaning against a ballot box with the
caption “As long as I count the votes, what are you going
to do about it?” These cartoons were so effective in part
because many of the citizens who supported Tweed were
illiterate and thus could not read the newspaper accounts
of his criminal activities. Nast’s cartoons, though, widely
exposed the public to the injustice of Tweed’s political
machine.

Nast’s campaign to bring down Tweed and the
Tammany Hall gang was ultimately successful. In the
elections of 1871, the public voted against most of the
Tammany Hall candidates, greatly weakening Tweed’s
power. Eventually, Tweed and his gang were
20 persecuted for a number of charges, including fraud
and larceny, and many of them were sent to jail. In 1875
Tweed escaped from jail and fled to Spain and
unwittingly 21 brought about one final 22 pinnacle for
the power of political cartoons: A Spanish police officer
recognized Tweed from one of Nast’s cartoons.
Consequently, Tweed was sent back to jail, and Nast was
hailed as the man who toppled the great Tammany Hall
machine.
