In the United States  employees typically work five days a week for eight hours
each day  However  many employees want to work a four day week and are
willing to accept less pay in order to do so  A mandatory policy requiring
companies to offer their employees the option of working a four day
workweek for four fifths  80 percent  of their normal pay would benefit the
economy as a whole as well as the individual companies and the employees
who decided to take the option 
The shortened workweek would increase company profits because employees
would feel more rested and alert  and as a result  they would make fewer
costly errors in their work  Hiring more staff to ensure that the same amount
of work would be accomplished would not result in additional payroll costs
because four day employees would only be paid 80 percent of the normal rate 
In the end  companies would have fewer overworked and error prone
employees for the same money  which would increase company profits  For
the country as a whole  one of the primary benefits of offering this option to
employees is that it would reduce unemployment rates  If many full time
employees started working fewer hours  some of their workload would have
to be shifted to others  Thus  for every four employees who went on an 80
percent week  a new employee could be hired at the 80 percent rate 
Finally  the option of a four day workweek would be better for individual
employees  Employees who could afford a lower salary in exchange for more
free time could improve the quality of their lives by spending the extra time
with their families  pursuing private interests  or enjoying leisure activities

Listening 
Offering employees the option of a four day workweek won t affect the
company profits  economic conditions or the lives of employees in the ways
the reading suggests 
First  offering a four day workweek will probably force companies to spend
more  possibly a lot more  Adding new workers means putting much more
money into providing training and medical benefits  Remember the costs of
things like health benefits can be the same whether an employee works four
days or five  And having more employees also requires more office space and
more computers  These additional costs would quickly cut into company
profits 
Second  with respect to overall employment  it doesn t follow that once some
employees choose a four day workweek  many more jobs will become
available  Hiring new workers is costly  as I argued a moment ago  And
companies have other options  They might just choose to ask their employees
to work overtime to make up the difference  Worse  companies might raise
expectations  They might start to expect that their four day employees can do
the same amount of work they used to do in five days  If this happens  then no
additional jobs will be created and current jobs will become more unpleasant 
Finally  while a four day workweek offers employees more free time to invest
in their personal lives  it also presents some risks that could end up reducing
their quality of life  Working a shorter week can decrease employees  job
stability and harm their chances for advancing their careers  Four day
employees are likely to be the first to lose their jobs during an economic
downturn  They may also be passed over for promotions because companies
might prefer to have five day employees in management positions to ensure
continuous coverage and consistent supervision for the entire workweek

Reading：
In many organizations  perhaps the best way to approach certain new projects
is to assemble a group of people into a team  Having a team of people attack a
project offers several advantages  First of all  a group of people has a wider
range of knowledge  expertise  and skills than any single individual is likely to
possess  Also  because of the numbers of people involved and the greater
resources they possess  a group can work more quickly in response to the task
assigned to it and can come up with highly creative solutions to problems and
issues  Sometimes these  creative solutions come about because a group is
more likely to make risky decisions that an individual might not undertake 
This is because the group spreads responsibility for a decision to all the
members and thus no single individual can be held accountable if the decision
turns out to be wrong  
Taking part in a group process can be very rewarding for members of the team 
Team members who have a voice in making a decision will no doubt feel better
about carrying out the work that is entailed by the decision than they might
doing work that is imposed on them by others  Also  the individual team
member has a much better chance to  shine   to get his or her contributions
and ideas not only recognized but recognized as highly significant  because a
team s overall results can be more far reaching and have greater impact than
what might have otherwise been possible for the person to accomplish or
contribute working alone

Listening    
Now I want to tell you about what one company found when it decided that it
would turn over some of its new projects to teams of people  and make the
team responsible for planning the projects and getting the work done  After
about six months  the company took a look at how well the teams performed 
On virtually every team  some members got almost a  free ride        they didn t
contribute much at all  but if their team did a good job  they nevertheless
benefited from the recognition the team got  And what about group members
who worked especially well and who provided a lot of insight on problems and
issues  Well       the recognition for a job well done went to the group as a
whole  no names were named  So it won t surprise you to learn that when the
real contributors were asked how they felt about the group process  their
attitude was just the opposite of what  the reading predicts 
Another finding was that some projects just didn t move very quickly  Why 
Because it took so long to reach consensus  it took many  many meetings to
build the agreement among group members about how they would move the
project along  On the other hand  there were other instances where one or two
people managed to become very influential over what their group did 
Sometimes when those influencers said  That will never work  about an idea
the group was developing  the idea was quickly dropped instead of being
further discussed  And then there was another occasion when a couple
influencers convinced the group that a plan of theirs was  highly creative  
And even though some members tried to warn the rest of the group that the
project was moving in directions that might not work  they were basically
ignored by other group members  Can you guess the ending to this story 
When the project failed  the blame was placed on all the members of the group

Reading 
Rembrandt is the most famous of the seventeenth century Dutch painters 
However  there are doubts whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt
were actually painted by him  One such painting is known as attributed to
Rembrandt because of its style  and indeed the representation  of the woman s
face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt  But there
are problems with the painting that suggest it could not be a work by
Rembrandt  
First  there is something inconsistent about the way the woman in the portrait
is dressed  She is wearing a white linen cap of a kind that only servants would
wear yet the coat she is wearing has a luxurious fur collar that no servant
could afford  Rembrandt  who was known for his attention to the details of his
subjects  clothing  would not have been guilty of such an inconsistency 
Second  Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow  but in this
painting these  elements do not fit together  The face appears to be
illuminated by light reflected onto it from below  But below the face is the dark
fur collar  which would absorb light rather than reflect it  So the face should
appear partially in shadow which is not how it appears  Rembrandt would
never have made such an error  
Finally  examination of the back of the painting reveals that it was painted on a
panel made of several pieces of wood glued together  Although Rembrandt
often painted on wood panels  no painting known to be by Rembrandt uses a
panel glued together in this way from several pieces  of wood   For these
reasons the painting was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt s
paintings in the 1930s 
For these reasons the painting was removed from the official catalog of
Rembrandt s paintings in the 1930s

Listening 
Everything you just read about  Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White
Bonnet  is true  and yet after a thorough re examination of the painting  a
panel of experts has recently concluded that it s indeed a work by Rembrandt 
Here is why 
First  the fur collar  X rays and analysis of the pigments in the paint have
shown that the fur collar wasn t part of the original painting  The fur collar was
painted over the top of the original painting about a hundred years after the
painting was made  Why  Someone probably wanted to increase the value of
the painting by making it look like a formal portrait of an aristocratic lady 
Second  the supposed error with light and shadow  Once the paint of the added
fur color was removed  the original could be seen  in the original painting  the
woman is wearing a simple collar of light colored cloth  The light colored cloth
of this collar reflects light that illuminates part of the woman s face  That s why
the face is not in partial shadow  So in the original painting  light and shadow
are very realistic and just what we would expect from Rembrandt   
Finally  the wood panel  It turns out that when the fur collar was added  the
wood panel was also enlarged with extra wood pieces glued to the sides and
the top to make the painting more grand and more valuable  So the original
painting is actually painted on a single piece of wood  as would be expected
from a Rembrandt painting  And in fact  researchers have found that the piece
of wood in the original form of  Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White
Bonnet  is from the very same tree as the wood panel used for another
painting by Rembrandt  his  Self portrait with a Hat

Reading  
Endotherms are animals such as modern birds and mammals that keep their
body temperatures constant  For instance  humans are endotherms and
maintain an internal temperature of 37°C   no matter whether the
environment is warm or cold  Because dinosaurs were reptiles  and modern
reptiles are not endotherms  it was long assumed that dinosaurs were not
endotherms  However  dinosaurs differ in many ways from modem reptiles 
and there is now considerable evidence that dinosaurs were  in fact 
endotherms  
Polar dinosaurs 
One reason for believing that dinosaurs were endotherms is that dinosaur
fossils have been discovered in Polar Regions  Only animals that can maintain
a temperature well above that of the surrounding environment could be active
in such cold climates  
Leg position and movement 
There is a connection between endothermy and the position and movement of
the legs  The physiology of endothermy allows sustained physical activity  such
as running  But running is efficient only if an animal s legs are positioned
underneath its body  not at the body s side  as they are for crocodiles and
many lizards  The legs of all modern endotherms are underneath the body  and
so were the legs of dinosaurs  This strongly suggests that dinosaurs were
endotherms 
Haversian canals 
There is also a connection between endothermy and bone structure  The
bones of endotherms usually include structures called Haversian canals  These
canals house nerves and blood vessels that allow the living animal to grow
quickly  and rapid body growth is in fact a characteristic of endothermy  The
presence of Haversian canals in bone is a strong indicator that the animal is an
endotherm  and fossilized bones of dinosaurs are usually dense with
Haversian canals 

9

 



Listening 
Many scientists have problems with the arguments you read in the passage 
They don t think those arguments prove that dinosaurs were endotherms  
Take the polar dinosaur argument  When dinosaurs lived  even the polar
regions  where dinosaur fossils have been found  were much warmer than
today  warm enough during part of the year for animals that were not
endotherms to live  And during the months when the polar regions were cold 
the so called polar dinosaurs could have migrated to warmer areas or
hibernated like many modern reptiles do  So the presence of dinosaur fossils
in polar regions doesn t prove the dinosaurs were endotherms  
Well  what about the fact that dinosaurs have their legs placed under their
bodies  not out to the side like crocodiles  That doesn t necessarily mean
dinosaurs were high energy endotherms built for running  There is another
explanation for having legs under the body  This body structure supports more
weight  so with the legs under their bodies  dinosaurs can grow to a very large
size  Being large had advantages for dinosaurs  so we don t need the idea of
endothermy and running to explain why dinosaurs evolved to have their legs
under their bodies  
Ok  so how about bone structure  Many dinosaur bones do have Haversian
canals  that s true   The dinosaur bones also have growth rings  Growth rings
are thickening of the bone that  indicates periods of time when the dinosaurs
weren t rapidly growing  These growth rings are evidence that dinosaurs
stopped growing or grew more slowly during cooler periods  This pattern of
periodic growth  you know  rapid growth followed by no growth or slow
growth  and then rapid growth again  is characteristic of animals that are not
endotherms  Animals that maintain a constant body temperature year round
as true endotherms do grow rapidly even when the environment becomes
cool

Reading  
As early as the twelfth century A D   the settlements of Chaco Canyon in New
Mexico in the American Southwest were notable for their  great houses  
massive stone buildings that contain hundreds of rooms and often stand three
or four stories high  Archaeologists have been trying to determine how the
buildings were used  While there is still no universally agreed upon
explanation  there are three competing theories  
One theory holds that the Chaco structures were purely residential  with each
housing hundreds of people  Supporters of this theory have interpreted Chaco
great houses as earlier versions of the architecture seen in more recent
Southwest societies  In particular  the Chaco houses appear strikingly similar
to the large  well known  apartment buildings  at Taos  New Mexico  in which
many people have been living for centuries 
A second theory contends that the Chaco structures were used to store food
supplies  One of the main crops of the Chaco people was grain maize  which
could be stored for long periods of time without spoiling and could serve as a
long lasting supply of food  The supplies of maize had to be stored somewhere 
and the size of the great houses would make them very suitable for the
purpose 
A third theory proposes that houses were used as ceremonial centers  Close to
one house  called Pueblo Alto  archaeologists identified an enormous mound
formed by a pile of old material  Excavations of the mound revealed deposits
containing a surprisingly large number of broken pots  This finding has been
interpreted as evidence that people gathered at Pueblo Alto for special
ceremonies  At the ceremonies  they ate festive meals and then discarded the
pots in which the meals had been prepared or served  Such ceremonies have
been documented for other Native American cultures 

11

 



Listening  
Unfortunately none of the arguments about what the Chaco great houses were
used for is convincing  
First  sure  from the outside  the great houses look like later and Native
American apartment but the inside of the great houses casts serious doubt on
the idea that many people lived there  I ll explain  If hundreds of people were
living in the great houses  then there would have to be many fireplaces  where
each family did its daily cooking  but there are very few fireplaces  In one of
the largest great houses  there were fireplaces for only around ten families  Yet
there were enough rooms in the great house for more than a hundred families 
so the primary function of the houses couldn t have been residential  
Second  the idea that the great houses were used to store grain maize  
unsupported by evidence  It may sound plausible that large empty rooms were
used for storage  but excavations of the  great houses have not uncovered
many traces of maize or maize containers  If the great houses were used for
storage  why isn t there more spilled maize on the floor  Why aren t there
more remains of big containers  
Third  the idea that the great houses were ceremonial centers isn t well
supported either  You know that mound at Pueblo Alto  It contains lots of
other materials besides broken pots  stuff you wouldn t expect from
ceremonies  For example  there are large quantities of building materials 
sands  stones  even construction tools  This suggests that the mound is just a
trash heap of construction material  stuff that was thrown away or not used up
when a house was being built  The pots in the pile could be regular trash too 
leftover from the meals of the construction workers  So the Pueblo Alto mound
is not good evidence that the great houses were used for special ceremonies

Reading  ：
Communal online encyclopedias represent one of the latest resources to be
found on the Internet  They are in many respects like traditional printed
encyclopedias collections of articles on various subjects  What is specific to
these online encyclopedias  however  is that any Internet user can contribute a
new article or make an editorial change in an existing one  As a result  the
encyclopedia is authored by the whole community of Internet users  The idea
might sound attractive  but the communal online encyclopedias have several
important problems that make them much less valuable than traditional 
printed encyclopedias  
First  contributors to a communal online encyclopedia often lack academic
credentials  thereby making their contributions partially informed at best and
downright inaccurate in many cases  Traditional encyclopedias are written by
trained experts who adhere to standards of academic rigor that nonspecialists
cannot really achieve  
Second  even if the original entry in the online encyclopedia is correct  the
communal nature of these online encyclopedias gives unscrupulous users and
vandals or hackers the opportunity to fabricate  delete  and corrupt
information in the encyclopedia  Once changes have been made to the original
text  an unsuspecting user cannot tell the entry has been tampered with  None
of  this is possible with a traditional encyclopedia  
Third  the communal encyclopedias focus too frequently  and in too great a
depth  on trivial and popular topics  which creates a false impression of what
is important and what is not  A child doing research for a school project may
discover that a major historical event receives as much attention in an online
encyclopedia as  say  a single long running television program  The traditional
encyclopedia provides a considered view of what topics to include or exclude
and contains a sense of proportion that online  democratic  communal
encyclopedias do not 

13

 



Listening 
The communal online encyclopedia will probably never be perfect  but that s a
small price to pay for what it does offer  The criticisms in the reading are
largely the result of prejudice against and ignorance about how far online
encyclopedias have come  
First  errors  It s hardly a fair criticism that encyclopedias online have errors 
Traditional encyclopedias have never been close to perfectly accurate  if you
are looking for a realty comprehensive reference work without any mistakes 
you are not going to find it  on or off line  The real point is that it s easy for
errors in factual material to be corrected in an online encyclopedia But with
the printed and bound encyclopedia  the errors remain for decades 
Second  hacking  Online encyclopedias have recognized the importance of
protecting their articles from malicious hackers  One strategy they started
using is to put the crucial facts in the articles that nobody disputes in a
read only format  which is a format that no one can make changes to  That way
you are making sure that the crucial facts in the articles are reliable  Another
strategy that s being used is to have special editors whose job is to monitor all
changes made to the articles and eliminate those changes that are clearly
malicious 
Third  what s worth knowing about  The problem for traditional
encyclopedias is that they have limited space  so they have to decide what s
important and what s not  And in practice  the judgments of the group of
academics that make these decisions don t reflect the great range of interests
that people really have  But space is definitely not an issue for online
encyclopedias  The academic articles are still represented in online
encyclopedias  but there can be a great variety of articles and topics that
accurately reflect the great diversity of users  interests  The diversity of use in
topics that online encyclopedias offer is one of their strongest advantages

Reading  ：
In an effort to encourage ecologically sustainable forestry practices  an
international organization started issuing certifications to wood companies
that meet high ecological standards by conserving resources and recycling
materials  Companies that receive this certification can attract customers by
advertising their products as ecocertified  Around the world  many wood
companies have adopted new  ecologically friendly practices in order to
receive ecocertification  However  it is unlikely that wood companies in the
United States will do the same  for several reasons 
First  American consumers are exposed to so much advertising that they
would not value or even pay attention to the ecocertification label  Because so
many mediocre products are labeled  new  or improved    American
consumers do not place much trust in advertising claims in general 
Second  ecocertified wood will be more expensive than uncertified wood
because in order to earn ecocertification  a wood company must pay to have
its business examined by a certification agency  This additional cost gets
passed on to consumers American consumers tend to be strongly motivated
by price  and therefore they are likely to choose cheaper uncertified wood
products  Accordingly  American wood companies will prefer to keep their
prices low rather than obtain ecocertification  
Third  although some people claim that it always makes good business sense
for American companies to keep up with the developments in the rest of the
world  this argument is not convincing  Pursuing certification would make
sense for American wood companies only if they marketed most of their
products abroad  But that is not the case  American wood businesses sell most
of their products in the United States  catering to a very large customer base
that is satisfied with the merchandise  

15

 



Listening   
Well  despite what many people say  there is a good reason to think that many
American wood companies will eventually seek ecocertification for the wood
products  
First off  companies in the United States don t treat all advertising the same 
They distinguish between advertising claims that companies make about their
own products and claims made by independent certification agencies 
Americans have a lot of confidence in independent agencies  Thus
ecologically minded Americans are likely to react very favorably to wood
products ecologically certified by independent organization with a
international reputation for trustworthiness  
Second point  of course it is true that American consumers care a lot about
price  who  doesn t  But studies of how consumers make decisions show that
price alone determines consumers  decisions only when the price of one
competing products is much higher or lower  than the other  When the
difference between two products is small  say  less than 5 percent  as is the
case with certified wood  American often do choose on factories other than
price  And Americans are becoming increasingly convinced of the value of
preserving and protecting the environment  
And third  US Wood companies should definitely pay attention what is going
on in the wood business internationally  Not because of foreign consumers but
because of foreign competitors  As I just told you  there is a good chance that
many American consumers will be interested in ecocertified products  and
guess why  If American companies are slow capturing those consumers  you
can be sure that foreign companies will soon start crowding into the American
markets  offering ecocertified wood that domestic companies don t

Reading  ：
Toward the end of his life  the Chevalier de Seingalt  1725 1798  wrote a long
memoir recounting his life and adventures  The Chevalier was a somewhat
controversial figure  but since he met many famous people  including kings
and writers  his memoir has become a valuable historical source about
European society in the eighteenth century  However  some critics have raised
doubts about the accuracy of the memoir  They claim that the Chevalier
distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more
exciting and glamorous than it really was 
For example  in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in
Switzerland  he was very wealthy  and it is known that he spent a great deal of
money there on parties and gambling  However  evidence has recently
surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a
Swiss merchant  Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very
rich  he would not have needed to borrow money 
Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the
Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer
Voltaire  No one doubts that the Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed 
However  critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these
conversations accurately  because it was written many years after the
conversations occurred  Critics point out that it is impossible to remember
exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier 
Critics have also questioned the memoir s account of the Chevalier s escape
from a notorious prison in Venice  Italy  He claims to have escaped the
Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and
climbing through the roof  Critics claim that while such a daring escape makes
for enjoyable reading  it is more likely that the Chevaliers jailers were bribed
to  free him  They point out that the Chevalier had a number of politically
well connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe  

17

 



Listening  ：
No memoir can possibly be correct in every detail  but still  the Chevalier s
memoir is pretty accurate overall  and is  by and large  a reliable historical
source Let s look at the accuracy of the three episodes mentioned in the
reading  
First  the loan from the merchant  Well  that doesn t mean that the Chevalier
was poor  Let me explain  We know that in Switzerland  the Chevalier spent
huge amounts of money on parties and gambling  and he had wealth  But it
was a kind of property you have to seil first to get money  So it usually took a
few days to convert his assets into actual money  So when he ran out of cash 
he had to borrow some while he was waiting for his money to arrive  but that s
not being poor 
Second  the conversations with Voltaire  The Chevalier states in his memoir
that each night immediately after conversing with Voltaire  he wrote down
everything he could remember about that particular night s conversation 
Evidently the Chevalier kept his notes of these conversations for many years
and referred to them when writing the memoir  Witnesses who lived with the
Chevalier in his later life confirmed that he regularly consulted notes and
journals when composing the memoir 
Third  the Chevalier s escape from a prison in Venice  Other prisoners in that
prison had even more powerful friends than he did  and none of them were
ever able to bribe their way to freedom  So bribery hardly seems likely in his
case  The best evidence  though  comes from some old Venetian government
documents  They indicate that soon after the Chevalier escaped from the
prison  the ceiling of his old prison room had to be repaired  Why would they
need to repair a ceiling unless he had escaped exactly as he said he did

Car manufacturers and governments have been eagerly seeking a replacement
for the automobile s main source of power  the internal combustion engine  By
far the most promising alternative source of energy for cars is the
hydrogen based fuel cell engine  which uses hydrogen to create electricity that 
in turn  powers the car  Fuel cell engines have several advantages over
internal combustion engines and will probably soon replace them  
One of the main problems with the internal combustion engine is that it relies
on petroleum  either in the form of gasoline or diesel fuel  Petroleum is a finite
resource  someday  we will run out of oil  The hydrogen needed for fuel cell
engines cannot easily be depleted  Hydrogen can be derived from various
plentiful sources  including natural gas and even water  The fact that fuel cell
engines utilize easily available  renewable resources makes them particularly
attractive 
Second  hydrogen based fuel cells are attractive because they will solve many
of the world s pollution problems  An unavoidable by product of burning oil is
carbon dioxide  and carbon dioxide harms the environment  On the other hand 
the only byproduct of fuel cell engines is water  
Third  fuel cell engines will soon be economically competitive because people
will spend less money to operate a fuel cell engine than they will to operate an
internal combustion engine  This is true for one simple reason  a fuel cell
automobile is nearly twice as efficient in using its fuel as an automobile
powered by an internal combustion engine is  In other words  the fuel cell
powered car requires only half the fuel energy that the internal combustion
powered car does to go the same distance  

19

 



Listening  ：
The reading is correct in pointing out the problems associated with
oil powered cars  Yes  oil is a finite resource  and yes  burning oil harms the
environment  However  the reading is way too optimistic in its assessment of
hydrogen based fuel cell engines  Hydrogen is not the solution to these
problems  
First  hydrogen is not as easily available as the passage indicates  Although it s
present in common substances like water  it s not directly useable in that form 
For using a fuel cell engine  hydrogen must first be obtained in a pure liquid
state  This pure liquid hydrogen is a highly artificial substance  It s
technologically very difficult to produce and store liquid hydrogen  For
example  it must be kept very very cold at minus 253 degrees Celsius  Imagine
the elaborate cooling technology that s required for that  So hydrogen is not
such a practical and easily available substance  is it 
Second  using hydrogen would not solve the pollution problems associated
with cars  Why  Producing pure hydrogen creates a lot of pollution  To get
pure hydrogen from water or natural gas  you have to use a purification
process that requires lots of energy that s obtained by burning coal or oil  And
burning coal and oil creates lots of pollution  So although the cars would not
pollute  the factories that generated the hydrogen for the cars would pollute 
Third  there won t necessarily be any cost savings when you consider how
expensive it is to manufacture the fuel cell engine  That s because fuel cell
engines require components made of platinum  a very rare and expensive
metal  Without the platinum components in the engine  the hydrogen doesn t
undergo the chemical reaction that produces the electricity to power the
automobile  All the efforts to replace platinum with a cheaper material have so
far been unsuccessful

Reading  ：
The sea otter is a small mammal that lives in waters along the western coast of
North America from California to Alaska  When some sea otter populations off
the Alaskan coast started rapidly declining a few years ago  it caused much
concern because sea otters play an important ecological role in the coastal
ecosystem  Experts started investigating the cause of the decline and quickly
realized that there were two possible explanations  environmental pollution
or attacks by predators  Initially  the pollution hypothesis seemed the more
likely of the two  
The first reason why pollution seemed the more likely cause was that there
were known sources of it along the Alaskan coast  such as oil rigs and other
sources of industrial chemical pollution  Water samples from the area revealed
increased levels of chemicals that could decrease the otters  resistance to
life threatening infections and thus could indirectly cause their deaths 
Second  other sea mammals such as seals and sea lions along the Alaskan coast
were also declining  indicating that whatever had endangered the otters was
affecting other sea mammals  as well  This fact again pointed to environmental
pollution  since it usually affects the entire ecosystem rather than a single
species  Only widely occurring predators  such as the orca  a large predatory
whale   could have the same effect  but orcas prefer to hunt much larger prey 
such as other whales  
Third  scientists believed that the pollution hypothesis could also explain the
uneven pattern of otter decline  at some Alaskan locations the otter
populations declined greatly  while at others they remained stable  Some
experts explained these observations by suggesting that ocean currents or
other environmental factors may have created uneven concentrations of
pollutants along the coast 

21

 



Listening  ：
Well  ongoing investigations have revealed that predation is the most likely
cause of sea otter decline after all  Well  ongoing investigations have revealed
that predation is the most likely cause of sea otter decline after all  
First  the pollution theory is weakened by the fact that no one can really find
any dead sea others washing off on Alaskan beaches  That s not what you
would expect if infections caused by pollution started killing a lot of otters  On
the other hand  the fact that it s so hard to find dead otters is consistent with
the predator hypothesis  If an otter is killed by a predator  it s eaten
immediately so it can t wash up on shore  
Second  although orcas may prefer to hunt whales  whales have essentially
disappeared from the area because of human hunters  That means that orcas
have had to change their diet to survive and since only smaller sea mammals
are now available  orcas have probably started hunting those  So it probably is
the orcas that are causing the decline of all the smaller sea mammals
mentioned in the passage   the seals  the sea lions and the sea otters  
And third  the uneven pattern of otter decline is better explained by the orca
predation theory than by the pollution theory  What happens to otters seems
to depend on whether the location where they live is accessible to orcas or not 
In those locations that orcas can access easily  the number of sea otters has
declined greatly  However  because orcas are so large  they can t access
shallow or rocky locations  And shallow and rocky locations are precisely the
types of locations where sea otter populations have not declined

A recent study reveals that people especially young people are reading far less
literature  novels  plays  and poems  than they used to  This is troubling
because the trend has unfortunate effects for the reading public  for culture in
general  and for the future of literature itself   While there has been a decline
in book reading generally  the decline has been especially sharp for literature

reading less literature  the reading public is missing out on important benefits 
Unfortunately  missing out on the benefits of literature is not the only problem 
What are people reading instead  Consider the prevalence of self help books
on lists of best sellers  These are usually superficial poorly written  and
intellectually undemanding  Additionally  instead of sitting down with a
challenging novel  many persons are now more likely to turn on the television 
watch a music video  or read a Web page  Clearly  diverting time previously
spent in reading literature to trivial forms of entertainment has lowered the
level of culture in general 
The trend of reading less literature is all the more regrettable because it is
taking place during a period when good literature is being written  There are
many talented writers today  but they lack an audience  This fact is bound to
lead publishers to invest less in literature and so support fewer serious
writers  Thus  the writing as well as the reading of literature is likely to decline
because of the poor standards of today s readers

Listening  ：
It is often said that people are reading less literature today than they used to 
What should of this  Well first  a book doesn t have to be literature to be
intellectually stimulating  Science writing history  political analysis and so
forth aren t literature perhaps  but they are often of high quality and these
kinds of books can be just as creative and well written as a novel or a play
They can stimulate the imagination  So don t assume that someone who isn t
reading literature isn t  reading a good book 
But let s say that people aren t just spending less time with literature  they are
also spending less time with books in general  Does that mean that the cultures
is in decline  No  there s plenty of culturally valuable material that isn t
written   music and movies  for example  Are people wasting their time when
they listen to a brilliant song or watch a good movie  Do these non literary
activities lower cultural standards  Of course not  Culture has changed  In
today s culture  there are many forms of expression available other than
novels and poems  And some of these creative forms speak more directly to
contemporary concerns than literature does  
Finally  it s probably true that there s less support for literature today than in
earlier generations  But don t be too quick to blame the readers  Sometimes
it s the author s faults  Let s be honest  A lot of modern literature is intended to
be difficult to understand  Here is not much reason to suppose that earlier
generations of readers would have read a lot of today s literature either

Reading  ：
Jane Austen  1775 1817  is one of the most famous of all English novelists 
and today her novels are more popular than ever  with several recently
adapted as Hollywood movies  But we do not have many records of what she
looked like  For a long time  the only accepted image of Austen was an amateur
sketch of an adult Austen made by her sister Cassandra  However recently a
professionally painted  full length portrait of a teenage girl owned by a
member of the Austen family has come up for sale  Although the professional
painting is not titled Jane Austen  there are good reasons to believe she is the
subject  
First  in 1882  several decades after Austen s death  Austen s family gave
permission to use the portrait as an illustration in an edition of her letters 
Austen s family clearly recognized it as a portrait of the author  So  for over a
century now  the Austen family itself has endorsed the claim that the girl in the
portrait is Jane Austen  
Second  the face in the portrait clearly resembles the one in Cassandra s sketch 
which we know depicts Austen  Though somewhat amateurish  the sketch
communicates definite details about Austen s face  Even though the Cassandra
sketch is of an adult Jane Austen  the features are still similar to those of the
teenage girl in the painting  The eyebrows  nose  mouth  and overall shape of
the face are very much like those in the full length portrait  
Third  although the painting is unsigned and undated  there is evidence that it
was painted when Austen was a teenager  The style links it to Ozias Humphrey 
a society portrait painter who was the kind of professional the wealthy Austen
family would hire  Humphrey was active in the late 1780s and early 1790s 
exactly the period when Jane Austen was the age of the girl in the painting  

25

 



Listening  ：
The evidence linking this portrait to Jane Austen is not at all convincing  Sure 
the painting has long been somewhat loosely connected to Austen s extended
family and their descendents  but this hardly proves it s a portrait of Jane
Austen as a teenager  The reading s arguments that the portrait is of Austen
are questionable at best  
First  when the portrait was authorized for use in the 1882 publication of her
letters  Jane Austen had been dead for almost 70 years  So the family members
who asserted that the painting was Jane had never actually seen her
themselves  They couldn t have known for certain if the portrait was of Austen
or not  
Second  the portrait could very well be that of a relative of Austen s  a fact that
would explain the resemblance between its subject and that of Cassandra s
sketch  The extended Austen family was very large and many of Jane Austen s
female cousins were teenagers in the relevant period or had children who
were teenagers  And some of these teenage girls could have resembled Jane
Austen  In fact  many experts believe that the true subject of the portrait was
one of those relatives  Marianne Kempian  who was a distant niece of Austen s 
Third  the painting has been attributed to Humphrey only because of the style 
But other evidence points to a later date  A stamp on the back of the picture
indicates that the blank canvas  you know the actual piece of cloth on which
the picture was painted  was sold by a man named William Legg  Record
showed that William Legg did not sell canvases in London when Jane Austen
was a teenager  He only started selling canvases when she was 27 years old  So
it looks like the canvas was used for the painting at a time when Austen was
clearly older than the girl in the portrait

Private collectors have been selling and buying fossils  the petrified remains of
ancient organisms  ever since the eighteenth century  In recent years  however 
the sale of fossils  particularly of dinosaurs and other large vertebrates  has
grown into a big business  Rare and important fossils are now being sold to
private ownership for millions of dollars  This is an unfortunate development
for both scientists and the general public  
The public suffers because fossils that would otherwise be donated to
museums where everyone can see them are sold to private collectors who do
not allow the public to view their collections  Making it harder for the public to
see fossils can lead to a decline in public interest in fossils  which would be a
pity  
More importantly  scientists are likely to lose access to some of the most
important fossils and thereby miss out on potentially crucial discoveries about
extinct life forms  Wealthy fossil buyers with a desire to own the rarest and
most important fossils can spend virtually limitless amounts  of money to
acquire them  Scientists and the museums and universities they work for
often  cannot compete successfully for fossils against millionaire fossil
buyers  
Moreover  commercial fossil collectors often destroy valuable scientific
evidence associated with the fossils they unearth  Most commercial fossil
collectors are untrained or uninterested in carrying out the careful field work
and documentation that reveal the most about animal life in  the past  For
example  scientists have learned about the biology of nest building dinosaurs
called oviraptors by carefully observing the exact position of oviraptor fossils
in the ground and the presence of other fossils in the immediate surroundings 
Commercial fossil collectors typically pay no attention to how fossils lie in the
ground or to the smaller fossils that may surround bigger ones 

27

 



Listening：
Of course there are some negative consequences of selling fossils in the
commercial market  but they have been greatly exaggerated  The benefits of
commercial fossil trade greatly outweigh the disadvantages 
First of all  the public is likely to have greater exposure to fossils as a result of
commercial fossil trade  not less exposure  Commercial fossil hunting makes a
lot of fossils available for purchase  and as a result  even low level public
institutions like public schools and libraries can now routinely buy interesting
fossils and display them for the public 
As for the idea that scientists will lose access to really important fossils  that s
not realistic either  Before anyone can put a value on a fossil  it needs to be
scientifically identified  right  Well  the only people who can identify fossils 
who can really tell what a given fossil is or isn t  are scientists  by performing
detailed examinations and tests on the fossils themselves  So even if a fossil is
destined to go to a private collector  it has to pass through the hands of
scientific experts first  This way  the scientific community is not going to miss
out on anything important that s out there 
Finally  whatever damage commercial fossil collectors sometimes do  if it
weren t for them  many fossils would simply go undiscovered because there
aren t that many fossil collecting operations that are run by universities and
other scientific institutions  Isn t it better for science to at least have more
fossils being found even if we don t have all the scientific data we d like to have
about their location and surroundings than it is to have many fossils go
completely undiscovered

Reading  ：
Every year  forest fires and severe storms cause a great deal of damage to
forests in the northwestern United States  One way of dealing with the
aftermath of these disasters is called salvage logging  which is the practice of
removing dead trees from affected areas and using the wood for lumber 
plywood  and other wood products  There are several reasons why salvage
logging is beneficial both to a damaged forest and to the economy  
First  after a devastating fire  forests are choked with dead trees  If the trees
are not removed  they will take years to decompose  in the meantime  no new
trees can grow in the cramped spaces  Salvage logging  however  removes the
remains of dead trees and makes room for fresh growth immediately  which is
likely to help forest areas recover from the disaster  
Also  dead trees do more than just take up space  Decaying wood is a highly
suitable habitat for insects such as the spruce bark beetle  which in large
numbers can damage live  healthy spruce trees  So by removing rotting wood 
salvage logging helps minimize the dangers of insect infestation  thus
contributing to the health of the forest 
Third and last  salvage logging has economic benefits  Many industries depend
upon the forests for their production  and because of this a fire can have a very
harmful effect on the economy  Often  however  the trees that have been
damaged by natural disasters still can provide much wood that is usable by
industries  Furthermore  salvage logging requires more workers than
traditional logging operations do  and so it helps create additional jobs for
local residents 

29

 



Listening  ：
Salvage logging may appear to be an effective way of helping forests recover
after a destructive fire or storm  but it can actually result in serious
longer term environmental damage  Its  economic benefits are also
questionable 
First  cleaning up a forest after a fire or storm does not necessarily create the
right conditions for tree growth  In fact  the natural process of wood
decomposition enriches the soil and makes it more suitable for future
generations of tree  The rapid removal of dead trees can result in soil  that
lacks the nutrients necessary for growth 
Second  it s true that rotting wood can increase insect populations  but is this
really bad for the forest  In fact  spruce bark beetles have lived in Alaskan
forest for nearly a hundred years without causing major damage  And of
course dead trees do not provide habitats only for harmful insects  They are
also used by birds and other insects that are important contributors to the
long term health of forests  In the long run  therefore  salvage logging may end
up doing more harm to forests than harmful insects do 
And third  the economic benefits of salvage logging are small and don t last
very long  in severely damaged forests  much of the lumber can be recovered
only by using helicopters and other vehicles that are expensive to use and
maintain  Furthermore  jobs created by salvage logging are only temporary
and are often fitted by outsiders with more experience or training than local
residents have

Reading  ：
The cane toad is a large  1 8 kg  amphibian species native to Central and South
America  It was deliberately introduced to Australia in 1935 with the
expectation that it would protect  farmers  crops by eating harmful insects 
Unfortunately  the toad multiplied rapidly  and a large cane toad population
now threatens small native animals that are not pests  Several measures  have
been proposed to stop the spread of the cane toad in Australia  
One way to prevent the spread of the toad would be to build a national fence  A
fence that blocks the advance of the toads will prevent them from moving into
those parts of Australia that they have not yet colonized  This approach has
been used before  a national fence was erected in the early part of the
twentieth century to prevent the spread of rabbits  another animal species that
was introduced in Australia from abroad and had a harmful impact on its
native ecosystems  Second  the toads could be captured and destroyed by
volunteers  Cane toads can easily be caught in simple traps and can even be
captured by hand  Young toads and cane toad eggs are even easier to gather
and destroy  since they are restricted to the water  If the Australian
government were to organize a campaign among Australian citizens to join
forces to destroy the toads  the collective effort might stop the toad from
spreading 
Third  researchers are developing a disease causing virus to control the cane
toad populations  This virus will be specially designed  although it will be able
to infect a number of reptile and amphibian species  it will not harm most of
the infected species  it will specifically harm only the cane toads  The virus will
control the population of cane toads by preventing them from maturing and
reproducing 

31

 



Listening  ：
The cane toad won t be as easy to get rid of as the reading suggests  The
measures proposed by the reading are likely either to be unsuccessful or to
cause unwanted environmental damage  First of all  a national fence probably
won t stop the spread of the toad  That s because young toads and toad eggs
are found in rivers and streams  No matter where the fence is located  at some
point there will be rivers or streams flowing from one side to the other  These
waterways will be able to carry the young toads and their eggs to the other
side  Since it s only necessary for a few young toads or eggs to get through the
fence in order to establish population on the other side  the fence is unlikely to
be effective  
Secondly  a massive group of volunteers could have success trapping and
destroying toads  But it s likely that these untrained volunteers would
inadvertently destroy many of Australia s native frogs  Some of which are
endangered  It s not always easy to tell the cane toad apart from native frogs
especially when it s young  
Third  using the virus is a bad idea because it could have terrible consequences
for cane toads in their original habitat in Central and South America  You
might be wondering how can a virus released in Australia cause harm in the
America  Well  Australian reptiles and amphibians are often transported to
other continents by researchers or pet collectors for example  Once the
animals infected by the virus reach Central and South America  the virus will
attack the native cane toads and devastate their populations  That would be
and ecological disaster because in the America cane toads are a native species
and a vital part of the ecosystem  So if they are eliminated  the whole
ecosystem will suffer

Reading  ：
The United Kingdom  sometimes referred to as Britain  has a long and rich
history of human settlement  Traces of buildings  tools  and art can be found
from periods going back many thousands of years  from the Stone Age 
through the Bronze Age  the Iron Age  the time of the Roman colonization  the
Middle Ages  up to the beginnings of the industrial age  Yet for most of the
twentieth century  the science of archaeology  dedicated to uncovering and
studying old cultural artifacts  was faced with serious problems and
limitations in Britain  
First  many valuable artifacts were lost to construction projects  The growth of
Britain s population  especially from the 1950s on  spurred a lot of new
construction in British cities  towns  and villages  While digging foundations
for new buildings  the builders often uncovered archaeologically valuable sites 
Usually  however  they proceeded with the construction and did not preserve
the artifacts  Many archaeologically precious artifacts were therefore
destroyed 
Second  many archaeologists felt that the financial support for archaeological
research was inadequate  For most of the twentieth century  archaeology was
funded mostly through government funds and grants  which allowed
archaeologists to investigate a handful of the most important sites but which
left hundreds of other interesting projects without support  Furthermore 
changing government priorities brought about periodic reductions in funding 
Third  it was difficult to have a career in archaeology  Archaeology jobs were to
be found at universities or with a few government agencies  but there were
never many positions available  Many people who wanted to become
archaeologists ended up pursuing other careers and contributing to
archaeological research only as unpaid amateurs

Listening   
In 1990  new rules and guidelines were adopted in United Kingdom and that
had changed the whole feel of Archaeology in that country  The new guidelines
improved the situation in all 3 areas discussed in the passage 
First  the new guidelines state that before any construction  project can start 
the construction site has to be examined by archaeologists to see whether the
site is of archaeological interest or value  If the site is of archaeological interest 
the next step is for the builders  archaeologists and local government officials
to get together and make a plan for preserving the archaeological artifacts 
either by building around them or by excavating a document in them properly
before the construction is allowed to proceed 
Second  an important part of new guidelines is the rule that any archaeological
work done on the construction site will be paid for by the construction
company not by the government  The construction company has to pay for the
initial examination of the site  and then for all the work carried out under the
preservation plan  This is whole new source of financial support  The funding
from the construction company has allowed researchers to study a far great
range of archaeological sites than they could in past 
Last  the new guidelines provide a lot of paid work for archaeologists  work
that didn t exist before  Expert archaeologists are now hired all stage of the
process to examine the site for archaeological value  then have to drop the
preservation plan to do the researcher and professional scientific manner and
finally to process the data and write reports and articles  The increased job
career opportunities in Archaeology have increased the number professional
archaeologists in Britain which is now the highest it s ever been

Reading：
In the past century  the steady growth of the human population and the
corresponding increase  in agriculture and pesticide use have caused much
harm to wildlife in the United States  birds in particular  Unfortunately for
birds  these trends are likely to continue  with the result that the number of
birds in the United States will necessarily decline  
First  as human populations and settlements continue to expand  birds  natural
habitats will continue to disappear  Forests  wetlands  and grasslands will give
way to ever more homes  malls  and offices  As the traditional areas suitable
for birds keep decreasing  so will the size of the bird populations that depend
on those vanishing habitats  
Second  agricultural activities must increase to keep pace with the growing
human population  The growth of agriculture will also result in the further
destruction of bird habitats as more and more wilderness areas are converted
to agricultural use  As a result  bird populations in rural areas will continue to
decline  
Third  as human settlements expand and agriculture increases  the use of
chemical pesticides will also increase  Pesticides are poisons designed to kill
agricultural and home garden pests  such as insects  but inevitably  pesticides
get into the water and into the food chain for birds where they can harm birds 
Birds that eat the poisoned insects or drink contaminated water can die as a
result  and even if pesticides do not kill birds outright  they can prevent them
from reproducing successfully  So pesticides have significantly contributed to
declines in bird population  and because there will continue to be a need to
control agricultural pests in the future  this decline will continue  

35

 



Listening：
The passage claims that there will be fewer and fewer birds  but the
arguments used to support this claim are unconvincing  
First  it s true that urban growth has been bad for some types of birds  but
urban development actually provides better and larger habitats for other
types  so much so that city and suburban dwellers often complain about
increased birds populations  seagulls at landfills  pigeons on the streets and so
on  Even birds like hawks and falcons can now be found in cities  where they
prey on the increasing populations of pigeons and rodents  So it s not going to
be a story of uniform decline of bird populations in the future  Some
populations may shrink  but others will grow  
As for agriculture  it s true that it too will increase in the future  but not in the
way assumed by the reading passage  The truth is  in the United States  less
and less land is being used for agriculture every year  Increasing in
agricultural production have resulted from and will continue to result from the
introduction of new  more productive varieties of crops  These new crops
produce more food per unit of land  and as a result  there s no need to destroy
wilderness areas 
And third  while it s certainly true that traditional pesticides have been
destructive to birds  it s incorrect to project this history into the future  Now
that people are aware of the possible consequences of traditional pesticides 
two changes have occurred  First  new and much less toxic pesticides have
been developed  and that s important  Second  and perhaps more importantly
there is a growing trend to develop more pest resistant crops  crops that are
genetically designed to be unattractive to pests  Pest resistant crops greatly
reduce the need for chemical pesticides  And best of all  pest resistant crops
don t harm birds at all

In the 1950s Torreya taxifoha  a type of evergreen tree once very common in
the state of Florida  started to die out  No one is sure exactly what caused the
decline  but chances are good that if nothing is done  Torreya will soon become
extinct  Experts are considering three ways to address the decline of Torreya  
The first option is to reestablish Torreya in the same location in which it
thrived for thousands of years  Torreya used to be found in abundance in the
northern part of Florida  which has a specific microclimate  A microclimate
exists when weather conditions inside a relatively small area differ from the
region of which that area is a part  Northern Florida s microclimate is very
favorable to Torreya s growth  This microclimate is wetter and cooler than the
surrounding region s relatively dry  warm climate  Scientists have been
working to plant Torreya seeds in the coolest  dampest areas of the
microclimate  
The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location  far from
its Florida microclimate  Torreya seeds and saplings have been successfully
planted and grown in forests further north  where the temperature is
significantly cooler  Some scientists believe that Torreya probably thrived in
areas much further north in the distant past  so by relocating it now  in a
process known as assisted migration  humans would simply be helping
Torreya return to an environment that is more suited to its survival  
The third option is to preserve Torreya in research centers  Seeds and saplings
can be moved from the wild and preserved in a closely monitored
environment where it will be easier for scientists both to protect the species
and conduct research on Torreya  This research can then be used to ensure the
continued survival of the species  

37

 



Listening：
  You ve just read about three ways to save Torreya taxifolia  Unfortunately 
none of these three options provides a satisfactory solution 
About the first solution reestablishing Torreya in the same location that s
unlikely to be successful  because of what s happening to the coolest dampest
areas within torreya s micro climate  These areas are being strongly affected
by changes in the climate of the larger region  This could be because global
warming has contributed to an increase in overall temperatures in the region
or because wetlands throughout Florida have been drained  Either way  many
areas across the region are becoming drier  so it s unlikely that Torreya would
have the conditions it needs to survive anywhere within its original Florida
micro climate 
Now about the second solution  relocating Torreya far from where it currently
grows  well  let s look at what happened when humans helped another tree 
the black locust tree  move north to a new environment  When they did this 
the black locust tree spread so quickly that it killed off many plants and trees
in the new environment  and some of these plants and trees were themselves
already in danger of becoming extinct   So assisted migration can have
unpredicted outcomes for the new environment 
Third  research centers are probably not a solution either  That s because the
population of Torreya trees that can be kept in the centers will probably not be
able to resist diseases  For a population of trees to survive a disease  it needs
to be relatively large and it needs to be genetically diverse  Tree populations in
the wild usually satisfy those criteria but research centers would simply not
have enough capacity to keep a large an diverse population of Torreya trees 
so trees in such centers will not be capable of surviving diseases in the long
term

Many consumers ignore commercial advertisements  In response  advertising
companies have started using a new tactic  called  buzzing   The advertisers
hire people  buzzers  who personally promote  buzz  products to people they
know or meet  The key part is that the buzzers do not reveal that they are
being paid to promote anything  They behave as though they were just
spontaneously praising a product during normal conversation  Buzzing has
generated a lot of controversy  and many critics would like to see it banned  
First  the critics complain that consumers should know whether a person
praising a product is being paid to praise the product  Knowing this makes a
big difference  we expect the truth from people who we believe do not have
any motive for misleading us  But with buzzing what you hear is just paid
advertising  which may well give a person incorrect information about the
buzzed product 
Second  since buzzers pretend they are just private individuals  consumers
listen to their endorsements less critically than they should  With
advertisements in print or on TV  the consumer is on guard for questionable
claims or empty descriptions such as  new and improved   But when
consumers do not know they are being lobbied  they may accept claims they
would otherwise be suspicious of  This may suit the manufacturers  but it
could really harm consumers 
And worst of all is the harmful effect that buzzing is likely to have on social
relationships  Once we become aware that people we meet socially may be
buzzers with a hidden agenda  we will become less trustful of people in
general  So buzzing will result in the spread of mistrust and the expectation of
dishonesty

buzzer  part time  you know  During the day  I m a student just like you  Now  I
read that piece attacking buzzing  it is really misleading  How would it describe
buzzing leading a lot  and gives a wrong impression 
First  it makes it sound like buzzers don t tell the truth about the products
they re buzzing  That s not true  How buzzing works this  companies find
people who use their products and who really think product is good  So
buzzing is not like ordinary advertisement where an actress is paid to read
some lies  Um  yes  I get paid for telling you what I am thinking  but you get the
truth from buzzers  I really do think my phone service is great  That is why
the company hired me 
Second  the reading makes it seem that when a buzzer talks to someone  the
person believes whatever they hear from the buzzer  Not true  In fact  the
opposite is true  People I talk to ask a
lot of questions about the products I buzz  that is about the price  service and
how long I used the product  If I don t have good answers  they won t buy the
products 
Finally  if you believe what you read  buzzing will destroy civilization  that is
stupid  If a product is bad  the company can t recruit buzzers  So what you get
from a buzzer is not only sincere but is likely to be about a good product  If you
try the phone service I use  you re gonna love it  So people who try buzzed
products are going to have a good experience  So end up being more trustful

In the United States  it had been common practice since the late 1960s no to
suppress natural forest fires  The  let it burn  policy assumed that forest fire
would burn themselves out quickly  without causing much damage  However 
in the summer of 1988  forest fires in Yellowstone  the most famous national
park in the country  burned for more than two months and spread over a huge
area  encompassing more than 800 000 acres  Because of the large scale of the
damage  many people called for replacing the  let it burn  policy with a policy
of extinguishing forest fires as soon as they appeared  Three kinds of damage
caused by the  let it burn  policy were emphasized by critics of the policy 
First  Yellowstone fires caused tremendous damage to the park s trees and
other vegetation  When the fires finally died out  nearly one third of
Yellowstone s land had been scorched  Trees were charred and blackened
from flames and smoke  Smaller plants were entirely incinerated What had
been a national treasure now seemed like a devastated wasteland 
Second  the park wildlife was affected as well  Large animals like deer and elk
were seen fleeing the fire  Many smaller species were probably unable to
escape  There was also concern that the destruction of habitats and the
disruption of food chains would make it impossible for the animals that
survived the fire to return 
Third  the fires compromised the value of the park as a tourist attraction 
which in turn had negative consequences for the local economy  With several
thousand acres of the park engulfed in flames  the tourist season was cut short 
and a large number of visitors decided to stay away  Of course  local businesses
that depended on park visitors suffered as a result

Actually fires are natural part of ecological cycle and their role is not just
destructive but also creative  That is why the  let it burn  policy is
fundamentally a good one  even if it sometimes causes fires of the 1988
Yellowstone fire  Let s look at what happened after 1988 Yellowstone fire 
First  vegetation  As you might imagine  scorched areas were in time colonized
by new plants  As a matter of fact  the plants in Yellowstone became more
diverse because the fire created an opportunity for certain plants that could
not grow otherwise  For example  areas where the trees have been destroyed
by fire could now be taken over by smaller plants that needed open and
shaded space to grow  And another example  seeds of certain plants species
won t germinate unless they re exposed to very high levels of heat  So  those
plants started appearing after the fire as well  
It s a similar story with the animals  Not only did their population recover  but
the fire also created new opportunities  For instance  the small plants that
replaced trees after the fire created an ideal habitat for certain small animals
like rabbits and hares  And when rabbits and hares started thriving  so did
some predators that depended on them for food  So  certain food chains
actually became stronger after the fire than they were before 
And last  fires like 1988 Yellowstone fire would be a problem for tourism if
they happened every year  But they don t  it was a very unusual combination of
factors that year  low rainfall  unusually strong winds  accumulation of dry
undergrowth that caused fire to be so massive  This combination has not
occurred since and Yellowstone has not seen such a fire since 1988  Visitors
came back to the park next year and each year after that

Genetic modification  a process used to change an organism s genes and hence
its characteristics  is now being used to improve trees through genetic
modification  It is possible to create trees  that produce more fruit  grow faster 
or withstand adverse conditions  Planting genetically modified trees on a large
scale promises to bring a number of benefits  
First  genetically modified trees are designed to be hardier than nature trees 
that is  they are more likely to survive than their unmodified counterparts  In
Hawaii  for example  a new pest resistant species of papaya trees has been
developed in response to ring spot virus  infections that have repeatedly
damaged the native papaya tree population  Planting the genetically modified
papayas has largely put an end to the rings pot problem  
Moreover  genetically modified trees promise to bring a number of economic
benefits to those who grow them  Genetically modified trees tend to grow
faster  give greater yields of food  fruit  or other products and be hardier  This
allows tree farmer to get faster and greater returns on  their farming
investment and save on pesticides as well  
Finally  the use of genetically modified trees can prevent overexploitation of
wild trees  Because of the growing demand for firewood and building timber 
many forests around the world are being cut down faster than they can be
replaced  Introducing genetically modified trees  designed for fast growth and
high yield in given geographic conditions  would satisfy the demand for wood

Sure  there are some benefits to plant genetically modified trees  but  are these
trees as really great as they first sound  When you examine the subject firstly 
there are some serious problems and costs associated with genetically
modified trees  
First  genetically modified trees may be resistant to one particular condition 
But that doesn t necessarily ensure their survival  You see  a typical non
modified trees  population is genetically diverse  That means that for most
threatening conditions  or climate  whatever  there will be at least some
individual tress of any given species of tree that are resistant  So even if most
of one kind of trees are killed  those few resistant tress will survive and ensure
the survival of that species of tree  But genetically modified trees are
genetically much more uniform  So if they re exposed to an environmental
challenge they have not been designed for  they all die  So if the climate
changes  the genetically modified trees will likely to be completely wiped out  
Now as to the second point  they re hidden costs associated with genetically
modified trees  You see  the company that genetically modify the tree can
charge tree farmers more for its seeds than un  genetically modified trees
would cost  Also  as you ve grown the tree  you can t just collect the seeds and
plant the new tree for free  By law  you have to pay the company every time
you plant  
And finally  genetically modified trees might actually cause even more damage
to the local wild trees  You see  genetically modified trees often grow more
aggressively than natural trees do  And  genetically modified trees are typically
planted among natural trees  As a result  the genetically modified trees
outcompete the native trees for resources  sunlight  soil  nutrients  and water 
eventually crowding out the natural trees

Reading  ：
Ethanol fuel  made from plants such as corn and sugar cane  has been
advocated by some people as an alternative to gasoline in the United States 
However  many critics argue that ethanol is not a good replacement for
gasoline for several reasons  
First  the increased use of ethanol fuel would not help to solve one of the
biggest environmental problems caused by gasoline use  global warming  Like
gasoline  ethanol releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when it is
burned for fuel and carbon dioxide is greenhouse gas  it helps trap heat in the
atmosphere  Thus  ethanol offers no environmental advantage over gasoline  
Second  the production of significant amounts of ethanol would dramatically
reduce the amount of plants available for uses other fuel  For example  much of
the corn now grown in the United States is used to feed farm animals such as
cows and chickens  It is estimated that if ethanol were used to satisfy just 10
percent of the fuel needs in the United States  more than 60 percent of the corn
currently grown in the united stated would have to be used to produce ethanol 
If most of the corn were used to produce ethanol  a substantial source of food
for animals would disappear 
Third  ethanol fuel will never be able to compete with gasoline on price 
Although the prices of ethanol and gasoline for the consumer are currently
about the same  this is only because of the help in the form of tax subsidies
given to ethanol producers by the United States government  These tax
subsidies have cost the United States government over $11 billion in the past
30 years  If the United States government were to stop helping producers in
this way  the price of ethanol would increase greatly  

45

 



Listening：
Ethanol actually is a good alternative to gasoline  although you just read three
reasons why it s not a good alternative  not one of these three reasons is
convincing  
First  the increased use of Ethanol fuel will not add to global warming  It s true
that  when Ethanol is burned  it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
but as you read  Ethanol is often made from plants such as corn  Well  the
process of growing the plants counteracts this release of carbon dioxide  Let
me explain  Every growing plant absorbs carbon dioxide from the air as part of
its nutrition  So growing plants for Ethanol production actually removes
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
Second  large scale production of Ethanol doesn t have to reduce the sources of
food for animals  That s because we can produce Ethanol using cellulose 
cellulose is the main component of plants  cell walls  and you ll find most
cellulose in those parts of plants that are not eaten by animals  So  since we can
produce Ethanol from the plant parts that aren t eaten  the amount of animal
feed that is available will not be reduced 
Third  in the future  Ethanol will be able to compete with gasoline in terms of
price  It s true that government subsidies make Ethanol cheaper than it would
normally be  but this support won t always be needed  Once enough people
start buying Ethanol  Ethanol producers will increase their production of
Ethanol  Generally  increased production of products leads to a drop in its
price  So the price of Ethanol will go down as more of it becomes available 
Studies show that  if Ethanol production could be three times greater than it is
now  the cost of producing a unit of Ethanol will drop by forty percent

Reading  ：
Populations of the yellow cedar  a species of tree that is common in
northwestern North America  have been steadily declining for more than a
century now  since about 1880  Scientists have advanced several hypotheses
explain this decline  
One hypothesis is that the yellow cedar decline may be caused by insect
parasites  specifically the cedar bark beetle  This beetle is known to attack
cedar trees  the beetle larvae eat the wood   There have been recorded
instances of sustained beetle attacks overwhelming and killing yellow cedars 
so this insect is a good candidate for the cause of the tree s decline  
A second hypothesis attributes the decline to brown bears  Bears sometimes
claw at the cedars in order to eat the tree bark  which has a high sugar content 
In fact  the cedar bark can contain as much sugar as the wild berries that are a
staple of the bears  diet  Although the bears  clawing is unlikely to destroy
trees by itself  their aggressive feeding habits may critically weaken enough
trees to be responsible for the decline  
The third hypothesis states that gradual changes of climate may be to blame 
Over the last hundred years  the patterns of seasonal as well as day to day
temperatures have changed in northwestern North America  These changes
have affected the root systems of the yellow cedar trees  the fine surface roots
now start growing in the late winter rather than in the early spring  The
change in the timing of root growth may have significant consequences 
Growing roots are sensitive and are therefore likely to suffer damage from
partial freezing on cold winter nights  This frozen root damage may be capable
of undermining the health of the whole tree  eventually killing it 

47

 



Listening  ：
Unfortunately  we still don t know what s killing the yellow cedar  none of the
explanations discussed in the reading is adequate  
First  the cedar bark beetle  Well  the problem with this explanation is that
healthy yellow cedars are generally much more resistant to insect infestation
than other tree species  For example  the bark and leaves of yellow cedar are
saturated with powerful chemicals that are poisonous to insects  So  healthy
cedars are unlikely to suffer from insect damage  So  how can we explain those
dead cedars that were infested with beetles  In those cases  the beetles attack
trees that  were already damaged or sick  and would ve probably died anyway 
So  the beetles are not the fundamental cause responsible for the decline of
yellow cedars  
Second  although bears damage some trees  there re not the cause of the
overall population decline  Yellow cedar population s been declining all across
the northwestern coast of North America both on the mainland and on islands
just off the coast  There were no bears on the islands  yet the islands cedars are
still in decline  Since the decline occurs with and without bears  the bears
cannot be responsible  
And finally  the theory about roots suffering from frost damage  well  the
reading passage forgot to take one factor into account  Many more trees are
dying at lower elevations where it is warm than at higher elevations where it
is cold  If freezing damage were responsible for the decline  we could expect to
see more trees dying in the cold weather of higher elevations  Instead 
more  trees are dying in the relative warmth of the lower elevations  So 
although the climate change may have made the cedar roots more sensitive
than it used to be  this isn t what s killing them

Reading：
Animal fossils usually provide very little opportunity to study the actual
animal tissues  because in fossils the animals  living tissues have been largely
replaced by minerals  Thus  scientists were very excited recently when it
appeared that a 70 million year old fossil of Tyrannosaurus rex  T  rex   a
dinosaur  might still contain remains of the actual tissues of the animal  The
discovery was made when researchers deliberately broke open the T  rex s leg
bone  thereby exposing its insides to reveal materials that seem to be remains
of blood vessels  red blood cells  and collagen matrix 
First  the breaking of the fossilized leg bone revealed many small branching
channels inside  which probably correspond to hollows in the bones where
blood vessels were once located  The exciting finding was the presence of a
soft  flexible organic substance inside the channels  This soft substance may
very well represent the remains of the actual blood vessels of T  rex 
Second  microscopic examination of the various parts of the inner bone
revealed the presence of spheres that could be the remains of red blood cells 
Tests showed that the spheres contained iron a material vital to the role of red
blood cells in transporting oxygen to tissues  Moreover  the spheres had dark
red centers  substances with iron tend to be reddish in color  and were also
about the size of red blood cells 
Third  scientists performed a test on the dinosaur leg bone that showed that it
contained collagen  Collagen is a fibrous protein that is a main component of
living bone tissue  in which it forms a so called collagen matrix  Collagen  or its
chemical derivatives  is exactly the kind of biochemical material that one
would expect to find in association with bone tissue 

49

 



Listening：
As much as we would like to have the remains of actual dinosaur tissue  there
are sound reasons for being skeptical of the identifications made in the
reading 
First  the soft  flexible substance inside the bone channels isn t necessarily the
remains of blood vessels  It s much more likely to be something else  Like
what  You might say  Well  long after an organism is died  bacteria sometimes
colonize hollows  empty areas in bones  like the channels that once held blood
vessels  When bacteria lived inside bones  they often leave behind traces of
organic material  What the researchers in the reading are identifying as blood
vessels might just be traces of soft and moist residue left by bacteria colonies 
All right  What about the iron filled spheres  Well  the problem is that scientist
s found identical reddish spheres in fossils of other animals found in the same
place  That includes fossils of primitive animals that did not have any red
blood cells when they were alive  Clearly  if these spheres appear in organisms
that did not have any red blood cells  then the spheres cannot be the remains
of red blood cells  The spheres probably have a very different origin  They are
probably just pieces of reddish mineral 
Third  the collagen  The problem is that we have never found collagen in
animal remains that are older than one hundred thousand years  Collagen
probably cannot last longer than that  Finding collagen from an animal that
lived seventy million years ago would really contradict our ideas about how
long collagen can last  It s just too improbable  The most likely explanation for
the presence of collagen is that it doesn t come from the T rex  but from
another much more recent source  For example  human skin contains collagen 
so the collagen may have come from the skin of the researchers who are handli
ng thebone

Reading 
In 1938 an archaeologist in Iraq acquired a set of clay jars that had been excav
ated two years earlier by villagers constructing a railroad line  The vessels wer
e about 2 200 years old  Each clay jar contained a copper cylinder surrounding
an iron rod  The archaeologist proposed that the vessels were ancient electric
batteries and even demonstrated that they can produce a small electric curren
t when filled with some liquids  However  it is not likely that the vessels were a
ctually used as electric batteries in ancient times 
First of all  if the vessels were used as batteries  they would probably have bee
n attached to some electricity conductors such as metal wires  But there is no e
vidence that any metal wires were located near the vessels  All that has been e
xcavated are the vessels themselves 
Second  the copper cylinders inside the jars look exactly like copper cylinders
discovered in the ruins of Seleucia  an ancient city located nearby  We know th
at the copper cylinders from Seleucia were used for holding scrolls of sacred te
xts  not for generating electricity  Since the cylinders found with the jars have t
he same shape  it is very likely they were used for holding scrolls as well  That
no scrolls were found inside the jars can be explained by the fact that the scroll
s simply disintegrated over the centuries 
Finally  what could ancient people have done with the electricity that the
vessels were supposed to have generated  They had no devices that relied on
electricity  As batteries  the vessels would have been completely useless to
them 

51

 



Listening 
Your reading says that these vessels were not used as batteries in ancient time
s  but the arguments used in the reading are not convincing  The battery expla
nation could very well be correct 
First  about the absence of wires or other conductors  Remember  vessels were
discovered by local people  not archaeologists  These people might have found
other material located near the jars  But since they were not trained archaeolo
gists they may not have recognized the importance of that material  So materia
ls serving as wires or conductors might have been overlooked as uninteresting
or even thrown away  We ll never know 
Second  it is true that the copper cylinders in the vessels are similar to the cyli
nders used to hold scrolls  but that does not really prove anything  It s possible
that the copper cylinders were originally designed to preserve scrolls  And
that some ancient inventor later discovered that if you use them together with
iron rods and some liquid in a clay vessel  they will produce electricity 
That s how the first ancient battery could have been born  In other words  the
copper cylinders could have been originally used for one purpose  but then
adapted for another purpose 
Finally  there s the question of the possible uses of the battery in the ancient w
orld  Well  the battery could produce a mild shock or tingling sensation when s
omeone touched it  This could very well have been interpreted as evidence of
some invisible power  You can easily see how people could convince others
that they had magical powers through the use of the battery  Also  the battery
could have been used for healing  Modern medicine uses mild electric current
to stimulate muscles and relieve aches and pains  Ancient doctors may have
used the batteries for the same purpose

The zebra mussel  a freshwater shellfish native to Eastern Europe  has long
been spreading out from its original habitats and has now reached parts of
North America  There are reasons to believe that this invasion cannot be
stopped and that it poses a serious threat to freshwater fish populations in all
of North America 
First  the history of the zebra mussel  spread suggests that the invasion might
be unstoppable  It is a prime example of an invasion made possible by human
transportation  From the zebra mussel  original habitats in Eastern Europe 
ships helped spread it out along new canals built to connect Europe s
waterways  The mussel can attach itself to a ship  s bottom or can survive in
the water called  ballast water  that the ship needs to take on to properly
balance its cargo  By the early nineteenth century  the mussel had spread to
the whole of Europe  It was later carried to the east coast of North America in
the ballast water of ships traveling from Europe  The way ships have spread
the zebra mussel in the past strongly suggests that the species will soon
colonize all of North America 
Moreover  once zebra mussels are carried to a new habitat  they can dominate
it  They are a hardy species that does well under a variety of conditions  and
they have a high rate of reproduction  Most important  however  zebra mussels
often have no predators in their new habitats  and species without natural
predators are likely to dominate their habitats 
Finally  zebra mussels are likely to cause a decline in the overall fish
population in habitats where they become dominant  The mussels are
plankton eaters  which means that they compete for food with many
freshwater fish species 

53

 



Listening 
Contrary to what you just read  there are ways to control the zebra mussel s
spread  What s more  it is not so clear that the mussel is a serious threat to fish
population  True  the spread of zebra mussels couldn t be controlled in the
past  but that s because people didn t have enough knowledge  In fact  there
are effective ways to stop ships from carrying the mussels to new locations 
Here s an example  The way zebra mussels usually travel across the ocean is
that a ship takes on some fresh  ballast water  in Europe and then empties
that water into American waterways when it arrives  Full of zebra mussels  but
the ship can be required to empty out the freshwater and refill with ocean
water while still out in the ocean  Salt water will kill the mussels 
Second  it s true that zebra mussels often don t have predators in their new
habitats  but that s only in the beginning  What s been happening in Europe is
that local aquatic birds sooner or later notice there s a new food source around
and change their habits to exploit it  They switch from whatever they were
eating before to eating zebra mussels  And birds can eat a lot of mussels  So
zebra mussels aren t so likely to dominate their new habitats after all 
Finally  even in habitats where zebra mussels become dominant  is the overall
fish population likely to decrease  It s true that zebra mussels may have a
negative impact on fish that eat plankton  But on other fish  they can have a
positive impact  For example  the mussels generate nutrients that are eaten by
fish that feed near the bottom of the lake or river  So bottom feeding fish
populations may increase  even if plankton eating fish population decrease

Reading 
The Little Ice Age was a period of unusually cold temperature in many parts of
the world that lasted from about the year 1350 until 1900C E  There were
unusually harsh winters  and glaciers grew larger in many areas  Scientists
have long wondered what caused the Little Ice Age  Several possible causes
have been proposed 
First  the cooling may have been caused by disrupting of ocean currents 
Before the Little Ice Age  there was a period of unusually warm weather during
which glaciers melted  These melted glaciers sent a large amount of cold
freshwater into the Gulf Stream  a large ocean current that strongly affects
Earth s climate  Some scientists believe that this freshwater was enough to
temporarily disrupt the Gulf Stream  Such a disruption could have caused the
Little Ice Age 
Second  volcanic eruption could have caused the Little Ice Age  When
volcanoes erupt  they send dark clouds of dust and sulfur gas into the
atmosphere  These clouds  which can spread over great areas  block some
sunlight from reaching Earth s surface  This can decrease the global
temperatures  Scientists know of several volcanic eruptions that took place
during the Little Ice Age 
Third  Substantial decreases in human populations may have contributed
indirectly to the cooling of the climate  For a variety of reasons  disease 
warfare  social disruption   the human population just before the Little Ice Age
and during the early part of it was lower than it had been in a long time  Forest
trees started growing on fields that were no longer used for agriculture  Since
trees absorb carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  they decrease the greenhouse
effect that keeps Earth warm  With more forest trees absorbing carbon dioxide 
Earth became cooler 

55

 



Listening 
Unfortunately  the arguments of the reading passage are a little out of date 
Scientists now have new information that shows that none of the ideas the
reading passage discusses could account for the Little Ice Age 
First  about the Gulf Stream  Scientists now know that disrupting the Gulf
Stream would cause cooling only in Europe and North America  but the Little
Ice Age also affected the Southern hemisphere in places like New Zealand and
Southern Africa for example  Since the disruption of the Gulf Stream cannot
explain why these southern areas became cooler it cannot explain the Little Ice
Age 
Second  the volcanoes theory  It s true that if volcanoes eruptions put enough
dust into the atmosphere  the result can be a cooler climate  But large amounts
of volcanic dust in the atmosphere would have also produced striking visual
effects that people would have noticed at the time  for example  dramatically
colorful sunset  or snow being grey or brown instead of white  But there are
almost no reports of anything like that routinely happening during the Little
Ice Age  So it seems that the volcanic eruptions during that period were simply
not strong enough to release the large amounts of dust needed to lower global
temperatures 
Third  about forests on farmland stopping the warming greenhouse effect by
removing carbon dioxide  There just was not enough time for this effect to
work  The human population grew back to previous levels fairly quickly  which
meant that forests were soon being cut down again to clear fields for the crops
needed to feed the growing population  As a result  we know that the forests
mentioned in the reading passage were not there long enough to cause the
long term global cooling of the climate

Robert E  Peary was a well known adventurer and arctic explorer who in 1909
set out to reach the North Pole  When he returned from the expedition  he
claimed to have reached the pole on April 7  1909  This report made him into
an international celebrity  Though some historians have expressed doubts that
Peary did in fact reach the North Pole  three arguments provide strong support
for the truth of Peary s claim 
First  the National Geographic Society put together a committee that
instructed to conduct a thorough investigation of Peary s records
equipment  At the end of the investigation  the committee concluded
Peary s accounts were consistent and persuasive and declared that he
indeed reached the North Pole 

was
and
that
had

Second  a recent expedition provides support for Peary s claim that he reached
the North Pole in only 37 days after setting out from Ellesmere Island off the
coast of Greenland  Skeptics used to argue that Peary could not have traveled
that fast  since even modern snowmobiles take longer to cover the same
distance  However  a British explorer named Tom Avery recently made the
same trek in less than 37 days  In fact  Avery used the same kind of dogsled
and the same number and breed of dogs as Peary had  Thus  Peary s claims are
not impossible  and he very well might have been telling the truth 
Third  there are photographs taken by Peary that support his claim to have
reached the North Pole  Measuring the shadows in Peary s photographs makes
it possible to calculate the Surf s position in the sun  The Surf s position
established from the photographs corresponds exactly to the Surf s position as
it should have been at the North Pole on that day  This provides strong
evidence that Peary reached the North Pole and took the photographs there 

57

 



Listening 
There is no solid evidence that Robert Peary reached the North Pole  The
arguments cited in the reading selection are not convincing 
First  it is true that the National Geographic Society committee declared that
Peary had indeed reached the North Pole  but the committee was not
completely objective  In fact  the committee was composed of Peary s close
friends who had contributed large sums of money to fund Peary s trip 
Moreover  the investigation lasted only two days  And according to Peary
himself  the committee did not examine his records carefully  So the
committee s conclusions seem biased and therefore are not trustworthy 
Second  the speed issue  Tom Avery s journey was different from Peary s in
important ways  For example  Avery s sled was similar to Peary  s sled  but
Avery carried much less weight than Peary did  Because Avery did not
transport his food on the sled  Avery s food was dropped along the way by
airplane  Moreover  Avery encountered highly favorable weather conditions 
unlike Peary who traveled in very unfavorable conditions  So Avery s speedy
trip was too different from Peary s to provide support for Peary  s claims 
Third  the photographs did not prove anything  The technique scientists used
to determine the sun s position depend on that measuring the shadows in the
photographs very precisely  Without precise measurement of the shadows  we
cannot establish the sun s exact position  Now  Peary s pictures were
photographed a hundred years ago using a primitive camera that took fuzzy 
slightly unfocused photographs  Moreover  the photos have become faded
and worn over time  As a result  the shadows in Peary s photographs look
blurred and faded  Those shadows cannot be used to calculate the position of
the sun with great accuracy  So we cannot be confident the photographs were
really taken at the North Pole

Reading 
Large numbers of dinosaur fossils have been discovered in deposits on
Alaska s North Slope  a region that today experiences an extremely cold  arctic
climate  One hundred million years ago  when those dinosaurs were alive  the
environment of the North Slope was already inhospitable  especially during
the winter when it experienced several months of total darkness  How did the
dinosaurs survive the wintertime  Paleontologists have proposed that one of
the most common North Slope dinosaurs  the elephant sized edmontosaur
 Edmontosaurus   survived the winter by migrating south to more hospitable
regions  Several arguments support the migration hypothesis 
First  the edmontosaur s diet supports the migration hypothesis 
Edmontosaurs fed exclusively on plants  Since there would have been no
plants growing during the cold and dark North Slope winter  it appears that
the edmontosaur must have left for at least part of the year and migrated to
more temperate zones to find food 
Second  many edmontosaur skeletons have been unearthed from the same site 
This suggests that edmontosaurs lived in herd  Many modern day migratory
animals  such as caribou and buffalo  live and migrate in herds as well  Moving
in herds helps animals coordinate their migration  The finding that
edmonotsaurs lived in herds further supports the migration hypothesis 
Finally  edmonosaurs were physically capable of migrating long distances  To
reach more hospitable regions  the edmontosaur had to migrate about 1 600
kilometers southward  To make such a journey  the edmontosaur needed to
move at about five kilometers per hour for several weeks  which is certainly
could do  These animals could run very fast  reaching speeds up to 45
kilometers per hour  It could have easily used its locomotive power to move to
warmer climate during the harsh arctic winters 

59

 



Listening 
The hypothesis that the edmontosaur migrated every winter is not convincing 
First  the edmontosaur did not have to migrate to find food  One hundred
million years ago the summer temperatures in the North Slope area were
warmer than they are today  And remember in arctic regions like the North
Slope the sun shines 24 hours a day at the peak of the summer  the warm
temperatures and the extensive daylight created incredibly good growing
conditions for plants  so much vegetation was produced during the summer
that when the vegetation died as the winter came  there was a lot of nutritious
dead vegetation around in the winter  The edmontosaur could have easily
lived on the dead plant matter during in the winter 
Second  just because edmontosaur lived in herds doesn t mean they migrated 
Animals lived in herds for many other reasons  Living in herds  for example 
provides animals extra protection from predators  Having extra protection is
useful even for the animals that live in the same area the whole year round  A
modern example of this is the Roosevelt elk  a large plant eater  Roosevelt elks
live in the forests of western United States  they live in herds  but they do not
migrate 
Third  although adult edmontosaur were capable of migrating in long
distances  What about edmontosaur that were not yet adults  juvenile
edmontosaur were not physically capable of travelling in great distances
required to reach warmer territories and would have slowed the herds so
much that the herd never would have made to its destination  The herd could
not have left the juveniles behind because the juveniles would not have
survived on their own  So the whole herd had to stay where they were and
survive on the cold North Slope

A little over 2 200 years ago  the Roman navy attacked the Greek port city of
Syracuse  According to some ancient historians  the Greeks defended
themselves with an ingenious weapon called a  burning mirror   A polished
copper surface curved to focus the Sun s rays onto Roman ships  causing them
to catch fire  However  we have several reasons to suspect that the story of the
burning mirror is just a myth and the Greeks of Syracuse never rally built such
a device 
First  the ancient Greeks were not technologically advanced enough to make
such a device  A mirror that would focus sunlight with sufficient intensity to
set ships on fire would have to be several meters wide  Moreover  the mirror
would have to have a very precise parabolic curvature  a curvature derived
from a geometric shape known as the parabola   The technology for
manufacturing a large sheet of copper with such specifications did not exist in
the ancient world 
Second  the burning mirror would have taken a long time to set the ships on
fire  In an experiment conducted to determine whether a burning mirror was
feasible  a device concentrating the Sun s rays on a wooden object 30 meters
away took ten minutes to set the object on fire  and during that time  the object
had to be unmoving  It is unlikely that Roman ships stayed perfectly still for
that much time  Such a weapon would therefore have been very impractical
and ineffective 
Third  a burning mirror does not seem like an improvement on a weapon that
the Greeks already had  flaming arrows  Shooting at an enemy s ships with
flaming arrows was a common way of setting the ships on fire  The burning
mirror and flaming arrows would have been effective at about the same
distance  So the Greeks had no reason to build a weapon like a burning mirror 

61

 



Listening 
The claims that the burning mirror would have been impractical and
technologically impossible are unconvincing 
First  the Greeks did not need to form a single sheet of copper to make a large 
burning mirror  An experiment has shown that dozens of small individually
flat pieces of polished copper could be arranged into a parabolic shape and
form a large  burning mirror  The Greek mathematicians know the properties
of the parabola and so could have directed the assembly of small mirror pieces
into the parabolic shape 
Second  about how long it would take to set a ship on fire with a burning
mirror  The experiment the reading selection mentions assumes that the
burning mirror was used to set the wood of the boat on fire  that is what takes
ten minutes  But Roman boats were not made just of wood  There were other
materials involved as well  For example  to seal the spaces between wooden
boards and make them waterproof  the ancient boat builders used a sticky
substance called pitch  Pitch catches fire quickly  an experiment showed that
pitch could be set on fire by burning mirror in seconds  And once the pitch was
burning  the fire would spread to the wood even if the ship was moving  So a
burning mirror could have worked quickly enough to be an effective weapon 
Third  why bother with a burning mirror instead of flaming arrows  Well 
Roman soldiers were familiar with flaming arrows and would have been
watching for them and were ready to put out the fires they might cause  But
you cannot see the burning rays from a mirror  You just see the mirror  But
then suddenly and magically a fire starts at some unobserved place on the ship 
that would have been much more surprising and therefore much more
effective than a flame arrow

A fossil skeleton of a dinosaur called Sinosauropteryx  preserved in volcanic as
h  was discovered in Liaoning  China  in 1996  Interestingly  the fossil included
a pattern of fine lines surrounding the skeletal bones  Some paleontologists int
erpret the lines as evidence that Sinosauropteryx had feathers  However 
critics have opposed the idea that Sinosauropteryx was a feathered dinosaur 
citing several reasons 
First  the critics points out that the fine lines may not even represent
functional structures of a living dinosaur  but rather structures that were form
ed after the animal s death  After the animal died and was buried in volcanic
ash  its skin may have decomposed into fibers  The skin fibers then became
preserved as lines in the fossil  the lines were misinterpreted as evidence of
feathers 
Second  even if the fine lines are remains of real structures of a Sinosauroptery
x  scientists cannot tell with certainty what part of the dinosaur s anatomy the
structures were  Many dinosaurs had frills  ornamental fan shaped structures
growing out of some parts of their bodies  Some of the critics argue that the
lines surrounding the skeleton are much more likely to be fossilized remains
of frills than remains of feathers 
A third objection is based on the fact that the usual functions of feathers are to
help animals fly or regulate their internal temperature  However  the structure
s represented by the lines in the Sinosauropteryx fossil were mostly located
along the backbone and the tail of the animal  This would have made the
structures quite useless for flight and of very limited use in thermoregulation 
This suggests that the lines do not represent feathers 

63

 



Listening 
The evidence that the lines in the Sinosauropteryx fossil represent feathers is
very strong  the arguments of the critics are unconvincing 
First  it s unlikely that the lines are a result of the decomposition of the
dinosaur s skin  Because we don t see any such decomposition in the fossils of
other animals buried at the same site  In fact  the fossils are many other animal
s buried at the site show evidence that the functional skin structures have
been beautifully preserved in volcanic ash  The well preserved condition of the
other fossils makes it likely that the Sinosauropteryx lines are also well
preserved foundational structures  possibly feathers  and that they are not
fibers caused by decomposition 
Second  the idea that the lines represent frills  Well  there is an important
chemical difference between feathers and frills  Feathers contain a great deal
of protein called beta keratin  frills  on the other hand  do not contain betakeratin  Our chemical analyses suggest that Sinosauropteryx structure did
contain beta keratin  So that indicates that the structures were feathers not
frills 
Third  feathers can be used for other functions than flight and thermo regulati
on  Think of a bird like a peacock for example  The peacock has long colorful
feathers in its tail and displays its tail in order to attract to mate  That s a
distinct function of feather called display function  Recently  we ve been able
to do analysis on the Sinosauropteryx s structures that showed us that the
structures were colorful  They were orange and white  The fact that they were
color strongly supports the idea thatthey were feathers that these dinosaurs
used for display

Starting in the 1960s and continuing until the 1980s  sailors in Russian
submarines patrolling the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean would occasionally
hear strange sounds  These underwater noises reminded the submarine crews
of frog croaks  so they called the sounds  quackers   from the Russian word for
frog sounds   The sources of the sound seemed to be moving with great speed
and agility  however  the submarines  sonar  a method of detecting objects
underwater  was unable to detect any solid moving objects in the area  There
are several theories about what might have caused the odd sounds 
The first theory suggests that the strange noises were actually the calls of male
and female orca whales during a courtship ritual  Orca whales are known to
inhabit the areas where the submarines were picking up the bizarre noises 
Orcas have been studied extensively  and the sounds they make when trying to
attract a male are similar to those that the submarines were detecting 
A second idea is that the sounds were caused by giant squid  Giant squids are
giant marine invertebrates that live deep in the ocean and prey on large fish 
They are difficult to detect by sonar because they have soft bodies with no
skeleton  Not much is known about giant squid behavior  but their complex
brains suggest they are intelligent animals  It is possible they have the ability
to emit sound  and perhaps they approached the submarines out of curiosity 
A third theory suggests the Russian submarines were picking up stray sounds
from some military technology  like another country s submarines that were
secretly patrolling the area  Perhaps the foreign submarines did not register
on sonar because they were using a kind of technology specifically designed to
make them undetectable by sonar  The strange froglike sounds may have been
emitted by the foreign submarines unintentionally

Listening 
 Female professor  Quackers are certainly a very strange phenomenon 
Experts still debate what the source of the sound was  No one can be sure
exactly what caused them  But these experts cite certain problems with all of
the theories that you just read about  Here are a few of the arguments that
they made 
First  the idea that the sounds were caused by Orca whales seems plausible at
first but is ultimately highly unlikely  It s that there are Orca populations in the
general areas that the Russian submarines were patrolling  But Orca whales
mostly live near the surface of the water  The submarines typically remain
deep in the ocean and should not have been able to hear the whale sounds
from near the surface  Also the Orca whales would have been detected by the
Russian sonar if they were nearby 
Giant squid may be a better candidate but one critical fact speaks against this
squid theory as well  Russian submarines first detected quacker sound in the
1960s and reports of them decades  But the sounds disappeared entirely by
the 1980s  However  as far as we know  squid have always lived in the ocean
where the submarines were patrolling and continue to live there today  If
these were squid sound  there would be no reason to suddenly start hearing
them in one decade and then suddenly stop hearing them twenty years later 
Third  the idea that the quackers were caused by a secret submarine from
another country does not hold up  The sources of the sound appear to move
around and change direction very quickly  Submarines cannot move or change
direction that quickly  Also  all submarines make some engine noise  b  But no
such noise accompanied the quackers  Even today  we don t have the
technology to build submarines that are that fast and have engines that are
that silent

Carved stone balls are a curious type of artifact found at a number of locations
in Scotland  They date from the late Neolithic period  around 4 000 years ago 
They are round in shape  they were carved from several types of stone  most
are about 70 mm in diameter  and many are ornamented to some degree 
Archaeologists do not agree about their purpose and meaning  but there are
several theories 
One theory is that the carved stone balls were weapons used in hunting or
fighting  Some of the stone balls have been found with holes in them  and many
have grooves on the surface  It is possible that a cord was strung through the
holes or laid in the grooves around the ball  Holding the stone balls at the end
of the cord would have allowed a person to swing it around or throw it 
A second theory is that the carved stone balls were used as part of a primitive
system of weights and measures  The fact that they are so nearly uniform in
size – at 70 mm in diameter – suggests that the balls were interchangeable and
represented some standard unit of measure  They could have been used as
standard weights to measure quantities of grain or other food  or anything that
needed to be measured by weight on a balance or scale for the purpose of
trade 
A third theory is that the carved stone balls served a social purpose as
opposed to a practical or utilitarian one  This view is supported by the fact that
many stone balls have elaborate designs  The elaborate carving suggests that
the stones may have marked the important social status of their owners

Listening 
 female professor  None of the three theories presented in the reading passage
are very convincing 
First  the stone balls as hunting weapons  common Neolithic weapons such as
arrowheads and hand axes generally show signs of wear  so we should expect
that if the stone balls had been used as weapons for hunting of fighting  they 
too  would show signs of that use  Many of the stone balls would be cracked or
have pieces broken off  However  the surfaces of the balls are generally well
preserved  showing little or no wear or damage 
Second  the carved stone balls maybe remarkably uniform in size  but their
masses vary too considerably to have been used as uniform weights  This is
because the stone balls were made with different types of stone including
sandstone  green stone and quartzite  Each type of stone has a different
density  Some types of stone are heavier than others just as a handful of
feathers weight less than a handful of rocks  Two balls of the same size are
different weights depending on the type of stone they are made of  Therefore 
the balls could not have been used as a primitive weighing system 
Third  it s unlikely that the main purpose of the balls was as some kind of
social marker  A couple of facts are inconsistent with this theory  For one thing 
while some of the balls are carved with intricate patterns  many others have
markings that are extremely simple  too simple to make the balls look like
status symbols  Furthermore  we know that in Neolithic Britain  when
someone died  particularly a high ranking person  they were usually buried
with their possessions  However  none of the carved stone balls have been
actually found in tombs or graves  That makes it unlikely that the balls were
personal possessions that marked a person s status within the community

A huge marine mammal known as Steller s sea cow once lived in the waters around 
Bering Island off the coast of Siberia  It was described in 1741 by Georg W  Steller  a 
naturalist who was among the first Europeans to see one  In 1768 the animal became extinct  
The reasons for the extinction are not clear  Here are three theories about the main cause of 
the extinction  
 

 

First  the sea cows may have been overhunted by groups of native Siberian people  If 
this theory is correct  then the sea cow population would have originally been quite large  
but hundreds of years off too much hunting by the native people diminished the number of 
sea cows  Sea cows were a good source of food in a harsh environment  so overhunting by 
native people could have been the main cause of extinction  
 

 

Second  the sea cow population may have become extinct because of ecosystems 
disturbances that caused a decline in their main source of food  kelp  a type of sea plant   
Kelp populations respond negatively to a number of ecological changes  It is possible that 
ecological changes near Bering Island some time before 1768 caused a decrease of the kelp 
that the sea cows depend on  
 

 

Third  the main cause of extinction of the sea cows could have been European fur 
traders who came to the island after 1741  It is recorded that the fur traders caught the last 
sea cow in 1768  It thus seems reasonable to believe that hunting by European fur traders  
who possessed weapons that allowed them to quickly kill a large number of the animals  
was the main cause of the sea cow s extinction  

                                                                                        69

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about  
 

 

 male professor  The truth is we don t know what the main cause of extinction of Steller s 
sea cow was  There are problems with each of the theories that you read about  
 

 

First  the sea cows were massive creatures  They were up to nine meters long and could 
weigh over ten tons  just enormous  A couple of sea cows could feed a small Siberian village 
for months  And the population of the native Siberian people wasn t very large  So while the 
Siberians certainly did hunt the sea cows  they didn t need to hunt a lot of them  So it s 
unlikely they were the ones who brought the sea cows to the point of extinction  
  

Second  about a hypothetical decrease in kelp caused by ecological disturbances  well  if 
something severe really happened in the ecosystem near Bering Island sometime before 
1768  it would have affected not just the kelp but also other parts of the ecosystem  For 
example  it would have caused the decline in other marine animals like whales  But fishing 
ships in the area did not report a whale decline  Since there is no indication of broader 
ecosystem problems  the kelp was probably growing just fine and the sea cows did not 
experience food shortage  
 

 

Third  it might seem like the European traders were responsible because the sea cows 
became extinct soon after the Europeans arrived  But  actually  by the time that the 
Europeans arrived  the sea cow population was already quite small  We have evidence that 
the sea cow population was at its largest hundreds of years before the 1700s  So something 
was causing a serious and on‐going decrease in the sea cow population long before the 
Europeans arrived in the Bering Island area  Whatever this something was  it should be 
considered the main cause of the extinction  not the European traders who were just the 
last to arrive

specific theories presented in the reading passage
