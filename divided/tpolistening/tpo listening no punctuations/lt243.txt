TPO 24 Lecture2 Art History  Modern Dance
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a dance history class
Professor  As we have been studying  ballet  the classical ballet  is based on formalized movements  specific positioning of the arms  feet and the body  So  now let s move on to modern dance  also known as theatrical dance  Modern dance evolved in the late nineteenth  early twentieth century  and in most cases  audiences were very receptive to this radical new type of performing art
Student  Um    what made modern dance so radical
Professor  Well  for example  I think the best analogy to modern dance is modern art or modern music  Compared to their classical predecessors  these newer art forms are freer  more experimental  more improvisational
Modern dance seeks to show how deep emotions and the music itself  how these intangible attributes can affect and inspire physical movement  and how movement can convey emotions to the audience  As I said  in classical ballet  emotions are conveyed through a set of strictly formalized movements
Now  a pioneer of modern dance was Isadora Duncan  who was born in 1878  Isadora Duncan did study ballet briefly as a child  but she quickly developed her own unique style  which she called free dance  And by age fourteen  she was teaching her free dance to young children and giving recitals
Her early dance technique was loosely based on the natural movements of children  running  skipping  acting out stories  also on motions from nature  waves crashing onto shore  trees swaying in the wind  Her expressive gestures were motivated from within rather than from being dictated by strict technique  Duncan also wore her hair down  ballerinas typically wear their hair in a tight bun behind the head  And instead of the short steep skirts and rigid toe shoes worn by ballerinas  Duncan wore loose  flowing tunics  and she dance bare foot  Now  that was something her audiences had never seen before
Duncan performed in Paris composers  but avoiding set audiences  for the most part  and other European cities  dancing to the music of classical movements and steps  no two performances were alike  And adored her
In 1904  she opened a school of modern dance in Berlin  And the next year she performed in Russia  But the Russian critics were not really kind  Some said Duncan s art form was closer to pantomime than to dance  But her style was a clear rebellion against ballet  and ballet is extremely important in Russia  A question  Julie
Student  Yeah  What did Duncan have against ballet  I mean  she studied it as a child
Professor  As a youngster  she might have found it too restrictive  uh  not creative enough  I think that feeling is exemplified by something that happened earlier in her career  in Russia  Duncan attended a ballet  and the lead dancer was the renowned Russian ballerinaï¼ŒAna Pavlova  The following day  Pavlova invited Duncan to watch her practice
Duncan accepted but was appalled by what she saw  To her  the exercises that Pavlova and the other ballerinas were doing seemed painful  even harmful  standing on tiptoe for hours  moving their bodies in unnatural ways  After seeing this  Duncan publicly denounced ballet as a form of acrobatics  uh  complicated and excruciating mechanism she called it  This critic generated I think some undue rivalry between ballet and modern dance  and it would take a long time  many years in fact  for the rivalry to calm down
