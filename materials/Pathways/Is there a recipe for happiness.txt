What makes us happy? Money? Friends?
‘A good job? Are the answers the same for
everyone? According to world surveys, Mexico
and Singapore are two happy countries—but
their people may be happy for different reasons.

SAFETY AND SECURITY

There are more than 21,000 people per
square mile! in the small nation of Singapore.
People on the island work very long hours and
regularly bring work home with them. The
country has strict laws against smoking in public,
littering,* and even jaywalking.* But according to
the World Database of Happiness, Singapore is
one of the happiest countries in Asia. Why?

One reason for Singapore’s happiness is that
the government provides the basic necessities,
such as housing and healthcare. There is
almost no extreme poverty in Singapore. The
government “tops up”* poorer people’s incomes
so everyone can have a minimum standard of
living. It also offers tax breaks’ to people who
look after their aging parents, The result is a lot
of closely connected families with roughly equal
standards of living.

People may not be happy about all the laws,
but they are generally happy with the results—
they breathe clean air, they don’t step in litter,
and the streets are safe and orderly. So for
Singaporeans, it seems that living in a secure,

clean, and safe place may be more important
than having a lot of personal freedom. Many
societies are trying to find a happy medium
between order and freedom. Singapore's
ranking on the World Database of Happiness
suggests that the country has done a pretty
decent job at it.

FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

In many ways, Mexico is the opposite of
Singapore.’There are some parts of Mexico
where people do not have a safe or secure life.
Many people do not have jobs, enough food, or
‘access to education. But, as in Singapore, most
people in Mexico feel that they are happy. Why?

‘One reason is the importance of social
interaction. According to psychologists, much
of our happiness comes from feeling that we
are part of a larger community. Simple acts
like smiling at a neighbor or having dinner
with friends can greatly increase our overall
happiness. People in Mexico socialize with

family and friends a lot, and this adds to their
happiness.

But what about poverty? In Mexico, about
half of the population is poor. However,
most Mexicans live near people in a similar
financial situation. If your neighbor doesn’t
have expensive items—such as a big house or
an expensive car—you probably don't feel the
need to have those things either. So money, by
itself, may not be that important for happiness,
What matters more is how much money you



have compared to the people around you.

‘A MIXED RECIPE?

So the question “What makes people
happy?” does not seem to have a simple
answer. Security, safety, freedom, and
socializing with friends and family can all play

4 important roles. As the examples of Singapore

and Mexico suggest, there may be no single
recipe for happiness. It is up to each of us to
find our own.
