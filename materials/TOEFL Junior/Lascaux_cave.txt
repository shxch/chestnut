Early artists drawing these animals
10 accomplished a monumental and difficult
task. They did not limit themselves to the
easily accessible walls but carried their
painting materials to spaces that required
climbing steep walls or crawling into narrow
15. passages in the Lascaux complex.

Unfortunately, the paintings have been
exposed to the destructive action of water
and temperature changes, which easily wear
the images away. Because the Lascaux caves

20 have many entrances, air movement has also
damaged the images inside. Although they
are not out in the open air, where natural
light would have destroyed them long ago,
many of the images have deteriorated and

25 are barely recognizable. To prevent further
damage, the site was closed to tourists in
1963, 23 years after it was discovered.
