TPO21 Lecture 4 Art History Alice Neel
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class

Professor
All right  so today we are moving on to Alice Neel  N E E L  Um    Alice Neel painted portraits  she was born in Pennsylvania  and she lived from 1900 to 1984  And I guess you might say  she experienced difficulties as an artist  She was in her 70s  before she had her first major solo exhibition  Um  and this is due at least in part to eh    or    because of photography  After photography became regarded as an art form  portrait painting became less prestigious6  less respected as an art form  And  well  art photography kind of took its place  so you can imagine that a portrait artist  would have had a hard time finding acceptance

Eh  but the real reason I want to look at Neel  is that I really find her style     eh  she had interesting ways of portraying people  She combined some elements of realism  What s realism  Alison

Student It s like painting something exactly how it is  so an artist would try to make it as accurate  um    and objective as possible  Painting stuff just how it appears on the surface

Professor Ok  good  So Neel combined realism with  well  actually  with expressionism  And that is  We  we just covered this

Student Um    It s into emotion  like artists are trying to  well  express themselves through the painting  right

Professor
Yep  The artist is depicting subjective emotions  showing the inner reality as interpreted by the artist rather than the outward form  So the image itself might be distorted or exaggerated in some way  The expression overrides7 objective representation  Ok  so  Alice Neel combined these two styles     Yes

Student Em    How is that even possible  How can your portray something exactly as it is and at the same time distort it with emotions  I don t get it

Professor
All right  good question  It is actually a good lead in8 to some of the techniques that Neel used  that she employed to bridge that contradiction  In a minute  I ll show you some of her portraits  and I ll want you to notice a few things about them

First  Neel s use of bold color  All right  You ll see she uses color to convey emtion and feeling  like the subjects  clothing for instance  it appears brighter than it really is  And the subjects  the people being portrayed  Neel paid special attention to faces  The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed  these are quite realistic  like the realists  work  But another thing Neel did was use elongated  sort of stretchy figures

Student But didn t a lot of expressionist painters do that  So really your are saying that Neel s techniques were similar to what other artists were doing  What was it that she did  that was like all her own

Professor Ok  well  I think it has to do partly with the way she combined these techniques  So  for example  those realistic faces and eyes  but bright  distorted figures  It is a mix  You ll see that her portraits do reflect reality  the people that were actually sitting there  Realism was important in the sense that she wanted to show people as they really were  much like a photographer would  But Neel wasn t satisfied with photo like realism  she went beyond that  And this is where expressionism comes in

She believed in capturing the whole person  not just what was on the surface  that s where the expressionists  distortion is important  in an attempt to reveal the subjects  character or personality

But Neel s paintings are distinctive for her time in part because they are portraits  Remember I said that photography and art photography had largely taken the place of portraiture  to the extent that some critics had declared the genre of portraiture to be dead  But Neel felt that painting should reflect reality  a real realist s stance9 you could say  And to her  individuals  people best reflect the reality of their time  of the age that they lived in  so she painted portraits  And if you look at her work  we are talking in the vicinity of10 three thousand paintings  If your looked at them  it is like this gallery of the whole century  an enormous range of subjects  families  women  children  artists  people in poverty  these paintings really span class  age and gender  It is like she transformed the genre  it is not just formal depictions of presidents and ancestors any more

But keep in mind that she was doing this when abstract art dominated the art scene  Representations of people weren t fashionable in the art world  And it wasn t until fairly late in the century that critics recognized the power of what she did
