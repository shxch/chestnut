Narrator

Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor

Student


Professor Jennings  I hope I am not interrupting  but you wanted to see me
Professor
Oh  hello  Suzane  Yes  yes  come right in  How are you doing
Student
All right

Professor

Well  good  The reason I wanted to talk to you was that while you were presenting you linguistics project in class the other day  well  you know  I was thinking you are a perfect candidate for the dean s undergraduate research fund

Student


Um     Professor   I am really sure what the    um     dean
Professor
Undergraduate research fund is     It is a mouthful I suppose  OK  Here s the thing  Every year the school has a pool of money to fund a number of research projects of undergraduate students  Because as you can imagine  indepth research often requires monetary support

Student


I would like to expand on my research
Professor
Good  First a panel of professors reviews the applications for the grant  And then they decide which project should be funded  The allotted money could be used for travel expenses  to attend a conference for example  or things like supplies  research equipment  resources that are necessary to conduct the research

Student I
see
Professor
Right  And I think you should apply for this grant  Your project is definitely eligible  And you can
expand it if you have the necessary resources  So  does it sound like something you would be interested in

Student


Oh  yeah  sounds great  I thought the topic I work on was very interesting  and it is certainly relevant to my linguistics major   I assume it will also look good when I try to get into graduate school  But how do I apply for the grant

Professor

It is pretty straightforward  A brief description of your proposed project  and an estimated budget  How much you need to spend and what you intend to spend it on  Also a glowing letter of recommendation from a linguistics professor wouldn t hurt  which I d be more than happy to write up for you

Student

OK  Cool  I am pretty clear on how to carry out my project  but I am not sure where I can find more information on the subject

Professor

Well  I have already thought of that  There s this private library at a university in Boston  By the way  because I graduated from that school  I can get you access to it  no problem  You see  the library houses lots of unpublished documents that are relevant to your topic

Student

So I can put that on the application for the grant  that I plan on using material from that library for my research and figure a trip to Boston into my budget

Professor

Exactly  I really think judging from your work in class  and the relevance and clarity of this project  you really have a good chance of getting the funding

Student


OK  I ll definitely apply then
Professor
The sooner the better   It is due in a few weeks  Gook Luck  And I ll get that letter written up right
away
