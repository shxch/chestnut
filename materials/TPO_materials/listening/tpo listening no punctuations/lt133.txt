TPO 13 Lecture 2 Ecology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an ecology class

Professor
So  continuing our discussion of ecological systems    whole systems  The main thing to keep in mind here is the interrelationships  The species in a system uh…  and even the landscape itself  they are interdependent  Let s take what you read for this week and see if we can apply this interdependence idea  Mike

Student
Well  um…  how about beavers    ecosystems with beavers and waterways

Professor
Good  good  go on

Student
Like  well  you can see how it s so important   cause if you go back before European settled in north America  like before the 1600s  back when native Americans were the only people living here  well  back then there were a lot of beavers  but later on  after Europeans…

Professor
OK  wait  I see where you are heading with this  but before we go into how European settlement affected the ecosystem  tell me this    what kind of environment do beavers live in  Think about what it was like before the Europeans settlers came  we ll come back to where you were headed

Student
OK  well  beavers live near streams and rivers and they block up the streams and rivers with like logs and sticks and mud  You know  they build dams that really slow down the flow of the stream  So then the water backs up  and creates like a pond that floods the nearby land

Professor
And that creates wetlands  OK  tell me more

Student
Well with wetlands  it s like there is more standing water  more still water around  and that water is a lot cleaner than swiftly flowing water  because the dirt and sediment and stuff has a chance to sink to the bottom

Professor
More important for our discussion  wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water  For example  there are more varieties of fish  or insects  lots of frog spices  and then species that rely on those species start to live near the wetlands too

Student
Yes  like birds and mammals that eat the fish and insects  and you get trees and plants that begin to grow near the standing water that can t grow near the running water  Oh  and there s something about wetlands and groundwater too
Professor  OK  good  Wetlands have a big effect on groundwater  the amount of water below the surface of the land  Think of wetlands as  Umm  like a giant sponge  the earth soaks up a lot of this water that s continually flooding the surface  which increases the amount of water below  So where there re wetlands  you get a lot of groundwater  and groundwater happens to be a big source of our own drinking water today

Alright… So  back to the beavers  what if the beavers weren t there

Student
You just have a regular running stream  because there is no dam  so the ecosystem would be completely different  there would be fewer wetlands

Professor
Exactly  so  now let s go back to where you were headed before  Mike  You mentioned a change that occurred after Europeans came to North America

Student
Yeah  well  there used to be beavers all over the place  something like 200 million beavers  just in the continental United States  But when Europeans came  they started hunting the beavers for their fur  because beaver fur is really warm  and it was really popular for making hats in Europe  So the beavers were hunted a lot  over hunted  they are almost extinct by the 1800s  so… that meant fewer wetlands  less standing water

Professor
And what does that mean for the ecosystem  Kate

Student
Well if there is less standing water  then the ecosystem can t support as many species  because a lot of insects and fish and frogs can t live in running water  and then the birds and animals that eat them  lose their food supply

Professor
Precisely  so the beaver in this ecosystem is what we call a keystone species  The term keystone kind of explains itself  In architecture  a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together  and keeps it from collapsing  Well  that s what a keystone species does in an ecosystem  It s the crucial species that keeps the system going  Now  beaver populations are on the rise again  but there is something to think about  Consider humans as part of these ecosystems  you ve probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use  especially in the summer time  in recent years  And remember what I said about groundwater  imagine if we still have all those beavers around  all those wetlands  What would our water supply be like then
