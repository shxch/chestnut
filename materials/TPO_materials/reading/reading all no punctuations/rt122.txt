Transition to Sound in Film
The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the 1920s marks  so far  the most important transformation in motion picture history  Despite all the highly visible technological developments in theatrical and home delivery of the moving image that have occurred over the decades since then  no single innovation has come close to being regarded as a similar kind of watershed  In nearly every language  however the words are phrased  the most basic division in cinema history lies between films that are mute and films that speak
Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of paradoxes  Nearly every movie theater  however modest  had a piano or organ to provide musical accompaniment to silent pictures  In many instances  spectators in the era before recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations alongside movies  visual images  from the Japanese benshi  narrators  crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical compositions performed by symphony size orchestras in Europe and the United States  In Berlin  for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin  film director Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel  1874 1930  on a musical score matching sound to image  the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the film its wide international fame
Beyond that  the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s  New color processes  larger or differently shaped screen sizes  multiple screen projections  even television  were among the developments invented or tried out during the period  sometimes with startling success  The high costs of converting to sound and the early limitations of sound technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or retarded advancement in these other areas  The introduction of new screen formats was put off for a quarter century  and color  though utilized over the next two decades for special productions  also did not become a norm until the 1950s
Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective  a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight  just as had many previous attempts  dating well back before the First World War  to link images with recorded sound  These critics were making a common assumption that the technological inadequacies of earlier efforts  poor synchronization  weak sound amplification  fragile sound recordings  would invariably occur again  To be sure  their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s sound experiments was not so far off the mark  yet they neglected to take into account important new forces in the motion picture field that  in a sense  would not take no for an answer
These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommunications companies that were developing and linking telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s  In the United States  they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph  General Electric  and Westinghouse  They were interested in all forms of sound technology and all potential avenues for commercial exploitation  Their competition and collaboration were creating the broadcasting industry in the United States  beginning with the introduction of commercial radio programming in the early 1920s  With financial assets considerably greater than those in the motion picture industry  and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships among entertainment and communications media  they revitalized research into recording sound for motion pictures
  In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released more than 300 sound films a rough figure  since a number were silent films with music tracks  or films prepared in dual versions  to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound  At the production level  in the United States the conversion was virtually complete by 1930  In Europe it took a little longer  mainly because there were more small producers for whom the costs of sound were prohibitive  and in other parts of the world problems with rights or access to equipment delayed the shift to sound production for a few more years  though cinemas in major cities may have been wired in order to play foreign sound films   The triumph of sound cinema was swift  complete  and enormously popular

 To suggest that audiences preferred other forms of entertainment to film before the transition to sound inthe1920 s
 To provide examples of some of the first sounds that were recorded for film
 To indicate some ways in which sound accompanied film before the innovation of sound films in the late 1920s

 The film was unpopular in the Soviet Union before it was screened in Berlin
 Eisenstein s film was the first instance of collaboration between a director and a composer

 distracted from
 explained
 conducted
 coordinated with




7  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is NOT true of the technological and aesthetic experiments of the 1920 s
 Because the costs of introducing recorded sound were low  it was the only innovation that was put to use in the 1920 s
 The introduction of recorded sound prevented the development of other technological innovations in the 1920 s
 The new technological and aesthetic developments of the 1920s included the use of color  new screen formats  and television

8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 It was difficult for some critics in the 1920s to imagine why the idea of sound film had faded from sight well before the First World War
 As surprising as it seems today  some critics in the 1920s believed that the new attempts at sound films would fade just as quickly as the attempts made before the First World War
 Though some early critics thought that sound film would fade  its popularity during the First World War proved that it was not simply a technical novelty
 Although some critics predicted well before the First World War that sound film would be an important technical innovation  it was not attempted until the 1920s

 expected

10  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true about the technical problems of early sound films
 Linking images with recorded sound was a larger obstacle than weak sound amplification or fragile sound recordings
 Sound films in the 1920s were unable to solve the technical flaws found in sound films before the First World War
 Technical inadequacies occurred less frequently in early sound films than critics suggested
 Critics assumed that it would be impossible to overcome the technical difficulties experienced with earlier sound films

11  In paragraph 5  commercial radio programming is best described as the result of

 the desire of electronics and telecommunications companies to make sound technology profitable
 a major development in the broadcasting industry that occurred before the 1920s
 the cooperation between telecommunications companies and the motion picture industry





12  According to paragraph 6  which of the following accounts for the delay in the conversion to sound films in Europe

 Smaller European producers believed that silent films with music accompaniment were aesthetically superior to sound films

The transition from silent to sound films was the most important development in film history





Answer Choices

 Although music and speech had frequently accompanied film presentations before the 1920s  there was a strong desire to add sound to the films themselves
 Because of intense interest in developing and introducing sound in film  the general use of other technological innovations being developed in the 1920s was delayed
 The rapid progress in sound technology made possible by the involvement of telecommunications companies transformed the motion picture industry
 Japanese filmmakers had developed the technology for creating sound films before directors in Europe and the United States began experimenting with sound
 Before the First World War  film directors showed little interest in linking images with recorded sound
 The arrival of sound film technology in the United States forced smaller producers in the motion picture industry out of business
