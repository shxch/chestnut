Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor

Almost all animals have some way of regulating their body temperature  otherwise they wouldn t survive extreme hot or cold conditions   sweating  panting  swimming to cooler or warmer water  ducking into somewhere cool like a burrow or a hole under a rock  these are just a few  And that spot is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment  because it s a microclimate

A microclimate is a group of climate conditions that affect a localized area  weather features like temperature  wind  moisture and so on  And when I say localized  I mean really localized  because microclimates can be  as the name suggests  pretty small  even less than a square meter  And microclimates are affected by huge number of other variables  Obviously weather conditions in the surrounding area are a factor  But other aspects of the location like  umâ€¦ the elevation of the land  the plant life nearby  and so on  have a substantial effect on microclimates  And of course the human development in the area  um  a road will affect a nearby microclimate  It s also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other can have very different conditions  In the forest for example  there can be a number of very different microclimates close to each other  because of all the variables I just mentioned

Student

So how does a hole in the ground  a burrow  stay cool in a hot climate

Professor

Well  since cold air sinks  and these spots are shaded  they are usually much cooler than the surrounding area  And these spots are so important because many animals rely on microclimates to regulate their body temperature  Um  for instance  there is a species of squirrel  in the Western part of the United States that can get really hot when they are out foraging for food  So they need a way to cool down  So what do they do  They go back to their own burrow  Once they get there  their body temperatures decrease very  very quickly  The trip to the burrow prevents the squirrel from getting too hot

Student

But squirrels are mammals  right  I thought mammals regulated their temperature
internally

Professor

Mammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature  but not all can do it to the same degree  or even the same way  Like when you walk outside on a hot day  you perspire  and your body cools itself down  a classic example of how a mammal regulates its own body temperature  But one challenge that squirrels face  well many small mammals do  is that because of their size  sweating would make them lose too much moisture  They dehydrate  But on the other hand  their small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces  So for small mammals  microclimates can make a big difference  They rely on microclimates for survival
Student

So cold blooded animals  like reptiles  they can t control their own body temperature  so I can imagine the effect a microclimate would have on them

Professor

Yes  many reptiles and insects rely on microclimates to control their body temperature  A lot of reptiles use burrows or stay under rocks to cool down  Of course with reptiles  it s a balancing act  Staying in the heat for too long can lead to problems  but staying in the cold can do the same  So reptiles have to be really precise about where they spend their time  even how they position their bodies  And when I say they re precise  I mean it    some snakes will search out a place under rocks of a specific thickness  because too thin a rock doesn t keep them cool enough  and too thick a rock will cause them to get too cold  That level of precision is critical to the snake for maintaining its body temperature

And even microscopic organisms rely on microclimates for survival  Think about this  decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil  the warm soil in turn affects the growth  the conditions of organisms there  And those organisms then affect the rate of decomposition of the leaves  So a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that even a tiny change can have a big impact  If someone on a hike knocks a couple of rocks over  they could be unwittingly destroying a microclimate that an animal or organism relies on
