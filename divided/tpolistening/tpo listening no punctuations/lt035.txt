Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class  The professor has been discussing the origins of art

Professor
Some of the world s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe  most of it in Spain and France  And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994

And you know  I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings  I said to my wife   Can you believe these paintings are over 30 000 years old   And my 3 year old daughter piped up and said   Is that older than my great grandmother   That was the oldest age she knew  And you know  come to think of it  It s pretty hard for me to really understand how long 30 000 years is too  I mean  we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty primitive  But I m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art is anything but primitive  They are masterpieces  And they look so real  so alive that it s very hard to imagine that they are so very old

Now  not everyone agrees on exactly how old  A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30 000 or more years ago  That would make them not just older than any other cave art  but about twice as old as the art in the caves at Altamira or Lascaux  which you may have heard of  Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux  and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet  without independent confirmation from any other lab  But be that as it may  whatever the exact date  whether it s 15 000  20 000 or 30 000 years ago  the Chauvet paintings are from the dawn of art  So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting

Now  one thing you ve got to remember is the context of these paintings  Paleolithic humans   that s the period we are talking about here  the Paleolithic  the early stone age  not too long after humans first arrived in Europe   the climate was significantly colder then  and so rock shelters  shallow caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain  And in some cases at least  artists drew on the walls of their homes

But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited  These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave  where no natural light can penetrate  There s no evidence of people ever living here  Cave bears  yes  but not humans  You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings  and a special trip to go see it  And each time you d have to bring along torches to light your way  And people did go see the art  There s charcoal marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made  So we can tell people went there  They came but they didn t stay  Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you d want to stay  so  why  What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places  We ll never really know of course  though it s interesting to speculate

But  um  getting to the paintings themselves  virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals  and Chauvet is no exception  The artists were highly skilled at using  or even enhancing  the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings  the sense of motion and vitality in these animals  Well  wait till I show you the slides  Anyway  most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores  Horses are most common overall with deer and bison pretty common too  probably animals they hunted

But earlier at Chauvet  there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals  lots of rhinoceros  lions  mammoth  bears  Remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then  so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time

But the Chauvet artists didn t paint people  There is a half man half bison creature and there is outlines of human hands but no depiction of a full human

So  why these precise animals  Why not birds  fish  snakes  Was it for their religion  magic or sheer beauty  We don t know  But whatever it was  it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness  So  on that note  let s dim the lights  so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used
