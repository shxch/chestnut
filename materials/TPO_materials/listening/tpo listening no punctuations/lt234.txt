TPO 23 Conversation 2
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and his English professor
Professor  Hi  Bob  How is it going  Are you enjoying the Introduction to Literature class
Bob  Yeah  it s great  Araby  that short story by James Joyce we read last week  it was awesome
Professor  I m glad you like it  Most of Joyce s work is very complex  A lot of students say that he is hard to understand  Normally  you wouldn t tackle Joyce in an Intro class  but I d like to give my first year students a taste of his style  his psychological approach to literature  because   mainly because it influenced other writers  I only wish we had more class time to discuss it
Bob  Me too  So why did you pick Araby instead of some other story
Professor  Well  um  first you should know that Araby is one of fifteen short stories by Joyce in a book called Dubliners  Uh  all the stories are related to one another  and they are set in the same time period  But Araby is the easiest one to follow  Though all the stories in the collection are written in stream of consciousness  which as you know  means they are told through the narrator s thought  through an inner monologue  as opposed to dialogue or an objective description of events  But Araby is easier because it s linear  the story unfold chronologically
Bob  Still  I wish we could read whole novels by Joyce and discussed them in class
Professor  That s what happens in my Master Writer Class
Bob  Master Writer Class
Professor  Yeah  I teach one on Joyce every spring  It s such a privilege  spending an entire term diving into a single body of work  And my students  they bring so much insight to the table that it s easy to forget who the professor is
Bob  Oh  wow  That could actually solve my dilemma  uh  what I originally wanted to ask you   um  I am working on my schedule for next term  and I ve got room for one more course  and I d like to take more literature  Could I take your Master Writer Class on Joyce
Professor  I m sorry  I should have mentioned  Uh  Master Writer is an advanced seminar  So students need to get a strong foundation in literary theory and criticism before I let them in the room
Bob  But I have gotten really good grades on all my paper so far  I m sure I can keep up  Couldn t you make an exception
Professor  Your grades are excellent  But in our intro class  you are reviewing the basics  like plots  setting and character and getting your first real exposure to different literary styles
Bob  But why do I have to study different styles to understand Joyce s novels
Professor  There are a lot of little details involved in interpreting literature  And like with Joyce  His novels have very unique structures  The only way to appreciate how you meet there is by studying a variety of authors
Bob  Oh  OK  So could you suggest a different literature class then
Professor  Sure  There s doctor Clain s course on nineteenth century novels  It s more focused than the class you re in now  But it will build on your current knowledge base and give you the background you need  That  plus a couple more foundational classes  and you will definitely be ready for my seminar
Bob  Sweet  Thanks
