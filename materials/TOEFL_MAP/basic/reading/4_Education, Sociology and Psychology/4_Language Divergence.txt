Language Divergence

Languages constantly undergo changes. Some are minor. Words and expressions gain new meanings. Grammar rules alter. In other cases, the changes are major. A language may diverge and become a new tongue. Or it may change over the course of time.

The Roman Empire once controlled a vast territory. This included all of Western Europe. In 476, the empire fell. The Dark Ages then began. During them, the people of Europe had little contact even with those in nearby cities. Previously, everyone had spoken Latin. But, as time progressed, the Latin that people spoke began to change. From Latin, several new languages arose. They included French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian. They are called the Romance Languages. These languages all have some similarities. They share an alphabet. They have many of the same root words. And they often use similar grammar. Yet they are separate languages.

A language may also change because the original speakers move to distant lands. English is one example of this. England is the home of the English language. Yet English speakers moved to places such as North America, Australia, New Zealand, and India. Over time, the English that people spoke in these places changed.   The local languages often adopted words from local natives.          SThe people used different expressions.   And they spoke with various accents.   Today, there are many versions of English spoken around the world.

Most languages change as time passes. English, Greek, Russian, and German have all greatly evolved over hundreds of years. Old English, Middle English, and Modern English are three separate languages. Beowulf, an epic poem written in Old English, uses language unintelligible to most modern speakers of English. Likewise, the ancient Greek spoken by Socrates and Plato is different from that used in modern-day Athens.
