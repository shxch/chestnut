Children and Advertising



Young children are trusting of commercial advertisements in the media  and advertisers have sometimes been accused of taking advantage of this trusting outlook  The Independent Television Commission  regulator of television advertising in the United Kingdom  has criticized advertisers for  misleadingness  creating a wrong impression either intentionally or unintentionally in an effort to control advertisers  use of techniques that make it difficult for children to judge the true size  action  performance  or construction of a toy


General concern about misleading tactics that advertisers employ is centered on the use of exaggeration  Consumer protection groups and parents believe that children are largely ill equipped to recognize such techniques and that often exaggeration is used at the expense of product information  Claims such as  the best  or  better than  can be subjective and misleading  even adults may be unsure as to their meaning  They represent the advertiser s opinions about the qualities of their products or brand and  as a consequence  are difficult to verify  Advertisers sometimes offset or counterbalance an exaggerated claim with a disclaimer a qualification or condition on the claim  For example  the claim that breakfast cereal has a health benefit may be accompanied by the disclaimer  when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast   However  research has shown that children often have difficulty understanding disclaimers  children may interpret the phrase  when part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast  to mean that the cereal is required as a necessary part of a balanced breakfast  The author George Comstock suggested that less than a quarter of children between the ages of six and eight years old understood standard disclaimers used in many toy advertisements and that disclaimers are more readily comprehended when presented in both audio and visual formats  Nevertheless  disclaimers are mainly presented in audio format only


Fantasy is one of the more common techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young audience  Child oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic and fantasy than advertisements aimed at adults  In a content analysis of Canadian television  the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play  Children have strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life  but children may not be adept enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal  Fantasy situations and settings are frequently used to attract children s attention  particularly in food advertising  Advertisements for breakfast cereals have  for many years  been found to be especially fond of fantasy techniques  with almost nine out of ten including such content  Generally  there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can distinguish between fantasy and reality in advertising  Certainly  rational appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited  as most advertisements use emotional and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations






The use of celebrities such as singers and movie stars is common in advertising  The intention is for the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become automatically linked in the audience s mind  In children s advertising  the  celebrities  are often animated figures from popular cartoons  In the recent past  the role of celebrities in advertising to children has often been conflated with the concept of host selling  Host selling involves blending advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other  Host selling occurs  for example  when a children s show about a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same lion promotes a breakfast cereal  The psychologist Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host selling reduced children s ability to distinguish between advertising and program material  It was also found that older children responded more positively to products in host selling advertisements


Regarding the appearance of celebrities in advertisements that do not involve host selling  the evidence is mixed  Researcher Charles Atkin found that children believe that the characters used to advertise breakfast cereals are knowledgeable about cereals  and children accept such characters as credible sources of nutritional information  This finding was even more marked for heavy viewers of television  In addition  children feel validated in their choice of a product when a celebrity endorses that product  A study of children in Hong Kong  however  found that the presence of celebrities in advertisements could negatively affect the children s perceptions of a product if the children did not like the celebrity in question
