Mass Extinctions
Cases in which many species become extinct within a geologically short interval of time are called mass extinctions  There was one such event at the end of the Cretaceous period  around 70 million years ago   There was another  even larger  mass extinction at the end of the Permian period  around 250 million years ago   The Permian event has attracted much less attention than other mass extinctions because mostly unfamiliar species perished at that time
The fossil record shows at least five mass extinctions in which many families of marine organisms died out  The rates of extinction happening today are as great as the rates during these mass extinctions  Many scientists have therefore concluded that a sixth great mass extinction is currently in progress
What could cause such high rates of extinction  There are several hypotheses  including warming or cooling of Earth  changes in seasonal fluctuations or ocean currents  and changing positions of the continents  Biological hypotheses include ecological changes brought about by the evolution of cooperation between insects and flowering plants or of bottom feeding predators in the oceans  Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very brief period during which all extinctions suddenly took place  other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more gradually  over an extended period  or at different times on different continents  Some hypotheses fail to account for simultaneous extinctions on land and in the seas  Each mass extinction may have had a different cause  Evidence points to hunting by humans and habitat destruction as the likely causes for the current mass extinction
American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski  who have studied extinction rates in a number of fossil groups  suggest that episodes of increased extinction have recurred periodically  approximately every 26 million years since the mid Cretaceous period  The late Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more drastic in a whole series of such recurrent extinction episodes  The possibility that mass extinctions may recur periodically has given rise to such hypotheses as that of a companion star with a long period orbit deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits  making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing widespread devastation upon impact
Of the various hypotheses attempting to account for the late Cretaceous extinctions  the one that has attracted the most attention in recent years is the asteroid impact hypothesis first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez  According to this hypothesis  Earth collided with an asteroid with an estimated diameter of 10 kilometers  or with several asteroids  the combined mass of which was comparable  The force of collision spewed large amounts of debris into the atmosphere  darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled  The reduced level of photosynthesis led to a massive decline in plant life of all kinds  and this caused massive starvation first of herbivores and subsequently of carnivores  The mass extinction would have occurred very suddenly under this hypothesis
One interesting test of the Alvarez hypothesis is based on the presence of the rare earth element iridium  Ir   Earth s crust contains very little of this element  but most asteroids contain a lot more  Debris thrown into the atmosphere by an asteroid collision would presumably contain large amounts of iridium  and atmospheric currents would carry this material all over the globe  A search of sedimentary deposits that span the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods shows that there is a dramatic increase in the abundance of iridium briefly and precisely at this boundary  This iridium anomaly offers strong support for the Alvarez hypothesis even though no asteroid itself has ever been recovered
An asteroid of this size would be expected to leave an immense crater  even if the asteroid itself was disintegrated by the impact  The intense heat of the impact would produce heat shocked quartz in many types of rock  Also  large blocks thrown aside by the impact would form secondary craters surrounding the main crater  To date  several such secondary craters have been found along Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula  and heat shocked quartz has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti  A location called Chicxulub  along the Yucatan coast  has been suggested as the primary impact site

There have been many attempts to explain the causes of mass extinctions



Answer Choices

 Asteroid impacts  evolutionary developments  and changes in Earth s climate and in the positions of the continents have all been proposed as possible causes of mass extinctions
 Researchers have observed 26 million year cycles in extinction rates of a number of fossil groups that could all be attributed to the same cause
 According to the Alvarez hypothesis  much of the iridium originally present on Earth was thrown into the atmosphere as a result of an asteroid impact that also caused a mass extinction
 The unusual distribution of iridium on Earth and the presence of craters and heat shocked quartz are central to the theory that an asteroid impact caused the late Cretaceous event
 The collision between Earth and a large asteroid resulted in massive damage and generated enough heat to cause irreversible changes in Earth s atmosphere
 There was a particularly large mass extinction that occurred around 250 million years ago at the end of the Permian period  whose cause could not be determined
