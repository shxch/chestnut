纸质版TPO4 lecture2 biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class

Professor
I want to continue our discussion about whales  Specifically  today  um  I want to talk about whale migration um  why whales head south for the winter  Or really why whales in the cold water of the Northern Hemisphere head south for the winter  Now  not all kinds of whales migrate  but most baleen whales do

And interestingly enough  we still don t really know why the baleen whales migrate  We do have several theories  however  which I II discuss today  U h  can anybody name one reason why baleen whales might migrate south  to the warm tropical water

Male student
Uh  for food  You know  the whales move to warmer water in order to find a good area to feed
Professor
Good guess  That should be an obvious reason after all  most animals that migrate do so for the purpose of finding food  But  uh  that doesn t seem to be the case with baleen whales  To understand why  you need to know something about water temperature  There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now  But let s just say that nutrients don t rise to the surface of tropical water like they do in other kinds of water  Tropical water simply never gets cold enough  So       well  what this means  uh  is that tropical water doesn t have much of the plankton that most whales feed on
Male student
I don t understand if there s no plankton  how do the whales survive through the winter
Professor
Right  How do they survive  You see  they don t have to eat anything  because they ve stored up so much fat during the summer feeding season that they can just survive off of that  So if they don t need to eat anything  we re back to our original question  Why do baleen whales migrate  Any theories  No
Well  there s one idea out there that a lot of people believe  In fact  uh  you could say it s the most popular theory we have about whale migration  Basically  the argument is that for baleen whales  migration is a kind of balancing act  Let me explain  On one hand  whales need to take advantage of the summer months by eating as much food as they can  And that s what they can do best in the northern seas  This allows them to build up a lot of fat  But in the winter  food is scarce even in the north  so what the whales need to do is save energy  And that s what migrating south can help them do       Amanda  you have a question

Female student
Yes  Um  the balancing act theory doesn t make sense to me  Maybe whales might need to save energy during the winter  but wouldn t moving all the way down to tropics make them lose energy
Professor
That s a good point  and it s one reason why this isn t a perfect theory  It does cost the whales energy to migrate  but it s easier for whales to save energy in warm water than it is to save energy in cold water  so there might still be  you know  a good reason to move south for the winter  OK

Now  before moving on to the next chapter  I want to briefly discuss how the baleen whale manages to navigate  It s pretty remarkable  because the whales manage to return to the same places year after year  and have to travel over an enormous area of ocean in order to do it  I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right  So exactly how do they do it
Well  a lot of experimental work still needs to be done  but we have been able to figure out at least three ways the baleen whale navigates without getting lost  The first is the ability to use Earth s magnetic field like it was a map  That sounds strange  but we know that many birds use that method  use the magnetic field  and it s possible that whales have the biological ability to do the same thing
Another theory is that if they stay close to the coast  whales might be able to find familiar landmarks and use those as guides  But we don t really know if a whale s eye sight is good enough to be able to do that  so that s not a perfect theory
And finally  we know that many whales make very loud sounds that can travel literally hundreds of miles underwater  Through a process called echolocation  it s possible that these whales hear the sounds bounce off of islands or other pieces of land and use those echoes as clues to help them find their way

Narrator
Listen again to part of the lecture  Then answer the question
Professor
To understand why  you need to know something about water temperature  There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now  But let s just say that nutrients don t rise to the surface of tropical water like they do in other kinds of water
Narrator
What does the professor mean when she says this
Professor
There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now

Narrator
Listen again to part of the lecture  Then answer the question
Professor
It s pretty remarkable  because the whales manage to return to the same places year after year  and have to trawl over an enormous area of ocean in order to do it  I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right
Narrator
What point does the professor make when she says this
Professor
I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right
