TPO10 Lecture 3 Ecology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Ecology Class

Professor
So we ve been talking about nutrients  the elements in the environment that are essential for living organisms to develop  live a healthy life and reproduce  Some nutrients are quite scarce  there just isn t much of them in the environment  But fortunately they get recycled  When nutrients are used over and over in the environment  we call that a nutrient cycle  Because of the importance of nutrients and their scarcity  nutrient recycling is one of the most significant eco system processes that we ll cover in this course  The three most important nutrient recycles are the nitrogen cycle  the carbon cycle and the one we are going to talk about today  the Phosphorus cycle

So the Phosphorus cycle has been studied a lot by ecologists because like I said  Phosphorus is an important nutrient and it s not so abundant  The largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean

How does Phosphorus get there  Well  let s start with the Phosphorus in rocks  The rocks get broken down into smaller and smaller particles as they are weathered  They are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time  Phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets spread around into the soil  Once it s in the soil  plants absorb it through their roots

Student
So that s the reason people mine rocks that contain a lot of Phosphorus to help with agriculture

Professor
Uh huh  they mined the rock  artificially break it down and put the Phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers  So humans can play a role in the first part of the Phosphorus cycle    the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs  You see

Now after the Phosphorus is in the soil  plants grow  They use Phosphorus from the soil to grow  And when they die  they decompose  And the Phosphorus is recycled back into the soil  same thing with the animals that eat those plants  or eat other animals that have eaten those plants  We call all of this â€“ the land phase of the Phosphorus cycle  But a lot of the Phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and melting snow  And so begins another phase of the cycle  Can anyone guess what it is called  Nancy

Nancy
Well  if the one is called the land phase  then this has to be called the water phase  right

Professor
Yes  that s such a difficult point isn t it  In a normal water phase  rivers eventually empty into oceans  and once in the oceans  the Phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like algae  Then fish eats the algae or eat other fish that have eaten those plants

But the water phase is sometime affected by excessive fertilizers  If not all of Phosphorus gets used by the crops and large amounts of Phosphorus gets into the rivers  This could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river  which can lead to the water ways getting clogged with organisms  which can change the flow of the water  Several current studies are looking at these effects and I really do hope we can find a way to deal with this issue before these ecosystems are adversely affected  Ok

Of course  another way that humans can interrupt the normal process is fishing  The fishing industry helps bring Phosphorus back to land  In the normal water phase the remaining Phosphorus makes its way  settles to the bottom of the ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments  But remember  this is a cycle  The Phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to somehow make its way back to the surface  to complete the cycle  to begin the cycle all over again

After millions of years  powerful geological forces  like underwater volcanoes lift up the ocean sediments to form new land  When an underwater volcano pushes submerged rock to the surface  a new island is created  Then over many more years the Phosphorus rich rocks of the new land begin to erode and the cycle continues

Guy
What about  well  you said that the nitrogen cycle is also an important nutrient cycle  And there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere  so I was wondering  is there a lot of Phosphorus in the atmosphere too

Professor
Good question  George  You re right to guess that Phosphorus can end up in Earth s atmosphere  It can move from the land or from the oceans to the atmosphere  and vice versa  However  there s just not a substantial amount of it there  like there is with nitrogen  it s a very minimal quantity
