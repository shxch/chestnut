Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian

Stu  Hi  I am new here and I couldn t come to the student orientation and I m wondering if you can give me a few quick pointers about the library  I d really appreciate it

Pro  Sure  I d be glad to  What s your major area of study

Stu  Latin American Literature

Pro  OK  Well  over here s the section where we have language  literature and the arts  And if you go downstairs you will find the history section  Generally  the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot

Stu  Um hmm  you are right  I am a transfer student and I ve already done a year at another university so I know how the research can go  I spent a lot of time in the history section  So how long can I borrow books for

Pro  Our loan period is a month  Oh I should also mention that we have an inter library loan service  If you need to get hold a book that s not in our library  there is a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area  It comes around three times a week

Stu  Hey  that s great  At my last school  it could take a really long time to get the materials I needed  So when I had a project  I had to make a plan way in advance  This sounds much faster  Another thing I was wondering is  is there a place where I can bring my computer and hook it up

Pro  Sure  There is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power but on top of that we also have a connection for the internet at every seat

Stu  Nice  so I can do the all research I need to do right here in the library  I ll have all the resources  all the books and the information I need right here in one place

Pro  Yeah  That s the idea  I am sure you ll need photocopiers too  There are down the hall to your left  We have a system where you have to use a copy card so you ll need to buy a card from the front desk  You insert it into the machine and you are ready to make copies

Stu  How much do you guys get charge

Pro  Seven cents a copy

Stu  Oh  that is not too bad  Thanks  Um  where is the collection of rare books

Pro  Rare books are up on the second floor  They are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled  to preserve the old paper in them  You need to get special permission to access them  and then you have to wear gloves to handle them  cause the oils in our hands  you know  can destroy the paper  And gloves prevent that so we have a basket of gloves in the room

Stu  Ok  Thanks  I suppose that s all I need to know  You ve been very helpful  Thanks

Pro  Anytime  Bye

Stu  Bye
