Questions 1-11 are based on the following passage.
A Necessary Resource for Science
In the winter of 1968, scientists David Schindler and
Gregg Brunskill poured nitrates and phosphates into
Lake 1 227, this is one of the 58 freshwater bodies that
compose Canada’s remotely located Experimental Lakes
Area. Schindler and Brunskill were contaminating the
water not out of malice but in the name of research.
While deliberately adding chemical compounds to a lake
may seem 2 destructive and irresponsible, this method
of experimenting is sometimes the most effective way to
influence policy and save the environment from even
more damaging pollution.

Schindler and Brunskill were investigating possible
causes for the large blooms of blue-green algae, or
cyanobacteria, that had been affecting bodies of water
such as Lake Erie. 3 In addition to being unsightly and
odorous, these algal blooms cause oxygen depletion.
Oxygen depletion kills fish and other wildlife in the lakes.
Just weeks after the scientists added the nitrates and
phosphates, the water in Lake 227 turned bright
4 green. It was thick with: the same type of algal
blooms that had plagued Lake Erie.

Which choice most effectively combines the
underlined sentences?
A) In addition to being unsightly and odorous,
these algal blooms cause oxygen depletion: the
result being that it kills fish and other wildlife in
the lakes.
B) In addition to being unsightly and odorous,
these algal blooms cause oxygen depletion; the
algal blooms cause oxygen depletion that kills
fish and other wildlife in the lakes.
C) In addition to being unsightly and odorous,
these algal blooms cause oxygen depletion, and
oxygen depletion caused by the algal blooms kills
fish and other wildlife in the lakes.
D) In addition to being unsightly and odorous,
these algal blooms cause oxygen depletion,
which kills fish and other wildlife in the lakes.

B) green: it was thick with
C) green. It was thick with—
D) green, it was thick with

5 One mission of the Experimental Lakes Area is
to conduct research that helps people better understand
threats to the environment. The scientists divided the
lake in half by placing a nylon barrier through the
narrowest part of its figure-eight shape. In one half of
Lake 226, they added phosphates, nitrates, and a source
of carbon; in the other, they added just nitrates 6 and a
source of carbon was added. Schindler and Brunskill
hypothesized that phosphates were responsible for the
growth of cyanobacteria. The experiment confirmed their
suspicions when the half of the lake containing the
phosphates 7 was teeming with blue-green algae.

Which choice provides the best transition from the
previous paragraph to this one?
A) NO CHANGE
B) The Experimental Lakes Area is located in
a sparsely inhabited region that experiences few
effects of human and industrial activity.
C) To isolate the cause of the algae, Schindler and
Brunskill performed another experiment, this
time using Lake 226.
D) The process by which water becomes enriched
by dissolved nutrients, such as phosphates, is
called eutrophication.
6
A) NO CHANGE
B) and a source of carbon.
C) plus also a source of carbon.
D) but also adding a source of carbon.
7
A) NO CHANGE
B) were teeming
C) are teeming
D) teems

Schindler and Brunskill’s findings were 8 shown
off by the journal Science. The research demonstrated a
clear correlation between introducing phosphates and the
growth of blue-green algae. 9 For example, legislators
in Canada passed laws banning phosphates in laundry
detergents, which had been entering the water supply. 10

At this point, the writer wants to add a second policy
outcome of the research described. Which choice
best accomplishes this goal?
A) Lake 226 continued to develop blooms of
blue-green algae for eight consecutive years after
the experiment took place.
B) In the United States, many individual states have
also adopted legislation to eliminate, or at least
reduce, phosphorous content in laundry
detergents.
C) In 1974, Schindler initiated a study of the effects
of acid rain, using Lake 223 to examine how
sulfuric acid altered aquatic ecosystems.
D) Aerial photos of the lakes taken before and
during algal blooms helped convey the effects
of phosphates in water to the public.

Experiments like these can help people understand
the unintended consequences of using certain household
products. 11 Of course, regulating the use of certain
chemical compounds can be a controversial issue.
Selectively establishing remote study locations, such as
the Experimental Lakes Area, can provide scientists with
opportunities to safely conduct controlled research. This
research can generate evidence solid enough to persuade
policy makers to take action in favor of protecting the
larger environment.

Which choice most effectively anticipates and
addresses a relevant counterargument to the
argument in favor of the types of experiments
described in the passage?
A) NO CHANGE
B) Many companies now offer phosphate-free
alternatives for household cleaning products.
C) Obviously, scientists should not be allowed to
randomly perform experiments on just any body
of water.
D) Phosphates are sometimes used in agricultural
fertilizers, in addition to being used in cleaning
products.
