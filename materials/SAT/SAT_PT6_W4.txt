Questions 34-44 are based on the following passage.
Gold into Silver: The “Reverse Alchemy” of Superhero
Comics History
34 Popular film franchises are often “rebooted” in
an effort to make their characters and stories fresh and
relevant for new audiences. Superhero comic books are
periodically reworked to try to increase their appeal to
contemporary readers. This practice is almost as
35 elderly as the medium itself and has in large part
established the “ages” that compose comic book history.
The shift from the Golden to the Silver Age is probably
the most successful 36 example: of publishers
responding to changing times and tastes.

Which choice most effectively combines the
underlined sentences?
A) In an effort to make their characters and stories
fresh and relevant for new audiences, popular
film franchises, which are often “rebooted,” are
similar to superhero comic books, which are
periodically reworked to try to increase their
appeal to contemporary readers.
B) Just as popular film franchises are often
“rebooted” in an effort to make their characters
and stories fresh and relevant for new audiences,
superhero comic books are periodically
reworked to try to increase their appeal to
contemporary readers.
C) Superhero comic books are periodically
reworked to try to increase their appeal to
contemporary readers, while popular film
franchises are often “rebooted” in an effort to
make their characters and stories fresh and
relevant for new audiences.
D) Superhero comic books are much like popular
film franchises in being often “rebooted” in an
effort to make their characters and stories fresh
and relevant for new audiences and periodically
reworked to try to increase their appeal to
contemporary readers.

The start of the first (“Golden”) age of comic books is
often dated to 1938 with the debut of Superman in Action
Comics #1. Besides beginning the age, Superman in many
respects defined it, becoming the model on which many
later superheroes were based. His characterization, as
established in Superman #1 (1939), was relatively simple.
He could “hurdle skyscrapers” and “leap an eighth of a
mile”; “run faster than a streamline train”; withstand
anything less than a “bursting shell”; and 37 lift a car
over his head. Sent to Earth from the “doomed planet”
Krypton, he was raised by human foster parents, whose
love helped infuse him with an unapologetic desire to
“benefit mankind.” Admirable but aloof, the Golden Age
Superman was arguably more paragon than character, a
problem only partially solved by giving him a human
alter ego. Other Golden Age superheroes were similarly
archetypal: Batman was a crime-fighting millionaire,
Wonder Woman a warrior princess from a mythical
island.

The writer wants a conclusion to the sentence and
paragraph that logically completes the discussion of
the Silver Age and provides an effective transition
into the next paragraph. Which choice best
accomplishes these goals?
A) NO CHANGE
B) the distinctions between later stages of comic
book history are less well defined than the one
between the Golden and Silver Ages.
C) readers increasingly gravitated to the upstarts as
the 1960s and the Silver Age drew to a close.
D) these characters themselves underwent
significant changes over the course of the
Silver Age.
By contrast, the second (“Silver”) age of comics was
marked by characters that, though somewhat simplistic
by today’s standards, 38 were provided with origin
stories often involving scientific experiments gone wrong.
In addition to super villains, the new, soon-to-be-iconic
characters of the 39 age: Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four,
and the Hulk among them—had to cope with mundane,
real-life problems, including paying the rent, dealing with
family squabbles, and facing anger, loneliness, and
ostracism. Their interior lives were richer and their
motivations more complex. Although sales remained
strong for Golden Age stalwarts Superman and, to a
lesser extent, Batman, 40 subsequent decades would
show the enduring appeal of these characters.

More transformations would take place in the
medium as the Silver Age gave way to the Bronze and
Modern (and possibly Postmodern) Ages. Such efforts
41 have yielded diminishing returns, as even the
complete relaunch of DC 42 Comics’ superhero’s, line in
2011 has failed to arrest the steep two-decade decline of
comic book sales. For both commercial and, arguably,
creative reasons, 43 then, no transition was more
successful than 44 those from the Golden to Silver Age.
