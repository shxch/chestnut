We ve said that the term  Cognition  refers to mental states like  knowing and believing  and to mental processes that we use to arrive at those states  So for example  reasoning is a cognitive process  so is perception  We use information that we perceive through our senses to help us make decisions  to arrive at beliefs and so on  And then there are memory and imagination which relate to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future  So perceiving  remembering  imagining are all internal mental processes that lead to knowing or believing

Yet  each of these processes has limitations and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions

Take memory for example  maybe you have heard of studies in which people hear a list of related words  Um…  let`s say a list of different kinds of fruit  After hearing this list  they are presented with several additional words  In this case  we`ll say the additional words were  blanket  and  cherry   Neither of these words was on the original list  and while people will claim correctly that  blanket  was not on the original list  they ll also claim incorrectly that the word  cherry  was on the list  Most people are convinced they heard the word  cherry  on the original list  Why did they make such a simple mistake  Well  we think because the words on the list were so closely related  the brain stored only the gist of what it heard  For example  that all the items on the list were types of fruit  When we tap our memory  our brains often fill in details and quite often these details are actually false

We also see this  fill in  phenomenon with perception  Perception is the faculty that allows us to process information in the present as we take it in via our senses  Again  studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought they perceived even when they didn t  For example  experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence  but it is missing the word that logically completes it  They ll claim to hear that word even though it was never said  So if I were to say…er…the Sun rises in the…and then fail to complete the sentence  people will often claim to have heard the word  east

In cognitive psychology  we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate  filling in of details     it s called  A Blind Spot  The term originally refers to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain  There are no photoreceptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye  So that particular area of the eye is incapable of detecting images  It produces  A Blind Spot  in our field of vision  We aren t aware of it  because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the image  so the picture always appears complete to us  But the term  blind spot  has also taken on a more general meaning    it refers to people being unaware of a bias that may affect their judgment about a subject

And the same  blind spot phenomenon  that affects memory and perception also affects imagination  Imagination is a faculty that some people use to anticipate future events in their lives  But the ease with which we imagine details can lead to unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions

So…um…Peter  suppose I ask you to imagine a lunch salad  no problem  right  But I bet you imagine specific ingredients  Did yours have tomatoes  Onion  Lettuce  mine did  Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people s image of a salad  which could lead to disappointment for us  If the next time we order a salad in a restaurant  we have our imagined salad in mind  that s not necessarily what we ll get on our plate  The problem is not that we imagine things  but that we assume what we ve imagined is accurate  We should be aware that our imagination has this built in feature  the blind spot  which makes our predictions fall short of reality
