Questions 23-33 are based on the following passage
and supplementary material.
How Do You Like Those Apples?
Marketed as SmartFresh, the chemical 1-MCP
(1-methylcyclopropene) has been used by fruit growers
since 2002 in the United States and elsewhere to preserve
the crispness and lengthen the storage life of apples and
other fruit, which often must travel long distances before
being eaten by consumers. 23 1-MCP lengthens storage
life by three to four times when applied to apples. This
extended life allows producers to sell their apples in the
off-season, months after the apples have been harvested.
And at a cost of about one cent per pound of apples,
1-MCP is a highly cost-effective treatment. However,
1-MCP is not a panacea for fruit producers or sellers:
there are problems and limitations associated with its use.
23
Which choice most effectively combines the
underlined sentences?
A) When applied to apples, 1-MCP lengthens
storage life by three to four times, allowing
producers to sell their apples in the off-season,
months after the apples have been harvested.
B) Producers are allowed to sell their apples
months after they have been harvested—in the
off-season—because 1-MCP, when applied to
apples, lengthens their storage life by three to
four times.
C) 1-MCP lengthens storage life, when applied
to apples, by three to four times, allowing
producers to sell their apples months after the
apples have been harvested in the off-season.
D) Months after apples have been harvested,
producers are allowed to sell their apples, in the
off-season, because 1-MCP lengthens storage life
when applied to apples by three to four times.

[1] 1-MCP works by limiting a fruit’s production of
ethylene, 24 it is a chemical that causes fruit to ripen and
eventually rot. [2] While 1-MCP keeps apples 25 tight
and crisp for months, it also limits 26 their scent
production. [3] This may not be much of a problem with
certain kinds of apples that are not naturally very
fragrant, such as Granny Smith, but for apples that are
prized for their fruity fragrance, such as McIntosh, this
can be a problem with consumers, 27 that will reject
apples lacking the expected aroma. [4] But some fruits do
not respond as well to 1-MCP as others 28 did, and
some even respond adversely. [5] Furthermore, some
fruits, particularly those that naturally produce a large

amount of ethylene, do not respond as well to 1-MCP
treatment. [6] Take Bartlett 29 pears, for instance, unless
they are treated with exactly the right amount of 1-MCP
at exactly the right time, they will remain hard and green
until they rot, and consumers who experience this will be
unlikely to purchase them again. 30
