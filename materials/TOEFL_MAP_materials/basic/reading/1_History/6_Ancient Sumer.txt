One of the world's first civilizations was founded in Sumer. It was located in an ancient land known as Mesopotamia. It arose between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sumer lasted from around 5300 B.C. to 1700 B.C. During this time, its people built one of the great ancient civilizations.

The people of Sumer were among the first humans to dwell in permanent settlements. They stopped being hunter-gatherers. They did this because they had learned about agriculture. The Sumerians were able to farm the land. In fact, the Sumerians developed advanced farming methods, such as irrigation, which enabled them to grow enough food to last all year round. As a result, the Sumerian population grew. Over time, more settlements were built. These eventually became small city-states.

The Sumerians also had their own religion. They worshiped many gods from temples they built in their city-states. There was a priestly class that controlled all religious activities. But the Sumerians were led by kings, so they constructed palaces as well. Yet both the kings and priests needed support. This led to the formation of a bureaucracy. By around 3000 B.C. the Sumerians had their own writing system. This was cuneiform. It utilized wedge-shaped symbols. The Sumerians mainly used it to write down their history and to record trades for goods.

Over time, the Sumerian civilization began to decline. Historians believe that the changing climate may have caused this. The land in southern Sumer became salty'. The farmers' crops failed. People began to move north to seek better lands. Outsiders also invaded Sumerian lands around 1900 B.C. This further weakened them. By 1700 B.C., the Babylonians had become the rulers of Mesopotamia. The Sumerians disappeared, leaving nothing but their legacy.
