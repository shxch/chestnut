Listen to a conversation between a student and a Professor

Professor
Hi Bill thanks for coming  I wanted to talk to you about …

Student
Is there     is there something wrong with my research paper

Professor
No  not at all  in fact it s very good  That s why I wanted to talk to you

Student
Oh  thanks

Professor
I think you know the department is looking to hire a new professor  are you familiar with our hiring process

Student
No  but what is that got to do with me

Professor
Well  Bill  we have several qualified applicants we are serious about  And as part of the interview process  we have them meet with a committee of professors and students in our department  They also have to give a talk

Student
You mean like a lecture

Professor
Yes  like a sample lecture on one of their academic interests

Student
Oh  so you can see their teaching style

Professor
Exactly

Student
Uh huh …Make sense

Professor
So I d like to know if you d be willing to join us as a student representatives on the interview committee  It d be a good experience for you  You could put it on your resume

Student
Oh… that d look good for my grad school application  I guess  so  what do I
have to do

Professor
The department secretary will give you a schedule of the applicants  visits  If you are free  we d like you to attend their talks and then later you can give us your opinion  Oh  and we usually serve lunch or snacks depending on what time the talk is

Student
Cool  that s another good reason to do this  Um… when is the next talk

Professor
We actually haven t had any yet  the first one is next Friday  at 10 AM  then lunch  and then formal discussion with the applicant right after

Student
Oh well  I m free on Fridays  If all the talks are on Fridays  I will be able to make it to all of them

Professor
That s great  now you should know that this job candidate is interested in the life cycles in the forest

Student
That s what my research about

Professor
Yes  I know that s why I feel it necessary to point out that even though this applicant s research interests are similar to yours  we want you to tell us what you think about the teaching of all these applicants  Your perspective as a student  how the applicant teaches in the classroom  that what s important to us

Student
I understand  So how many applicants are there

Professor
Let s see  we have 4  all very good candidates  that we will be looking at over the next few weeks  It s going to be a tough decision  But it ll be a good experience for you  especially if you re going to grad school

Student
Thank you  It ll be cool to do this  I ll get a copy of the schedule from the secretary on my way out

Professor
You re welcome  see you in class this afternoon
