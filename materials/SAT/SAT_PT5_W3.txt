Questions 23-33 are based on the following passage
and supplementary material.
Rethinking Crowdfunding in the Arts
Crowdfunding is a popular way to raise money using
the Internet. The process sounds simple: an artist,
entrepreneur, or other innovator takes his or her ideas
straight to the public via a crowdfunding website. The
innovator creates a video about the project and offers, in
exchange for donations, a series of “perks,” from
acknowledgment on a social media site to a small piece of
art. Many crowdfunding programs are all-or-nothing; in
other words, the innovator must garner 100 percent
funding for the project or the money is refunded to the
donors. At 23 it’s best, the system can give creators
direct access to millions of potential backers.
The home page of one leading crowdfunding site
features a project to manufacture pinhole cameras on a
3‑D printer. 24 The idea is obviously very attractive. An
obscure method of photography may be made available
to many with little expense. Within weeks, the project
was 621 percent funded. In contrast, on the same page, a
small Brooklyn performance venue is attempting to raise
money for its current season. The venue features works of
performance art showcased in a storefront window.
Those who have seen the space consider it vital.
25 However, that group may not be large enough; with
just fourteen days to go in the fund-raising period, the
campaign is only 46 percent funded.

Artists such as these Brooklyn performers find that
crowdfunding exacerbates problems that already exist.
26 Work, that is easily understood and appreciated, is
supported, while more complex work goes unnoticed.
27 Time that could be used creating art is spent devising
clever perks to draw the attention of potential
contributors. 28 In addition, audiences may contain
many “free 29 riders,” they did not make contributions.

Ironically, the success of crowdfunding may weaken
overall funding for the arts if people begin to feel that
paying for the art 30 loved by them is someone else’s
responsibility.
[1] One innovative playwright has woven the
deficiencies of the system into her crowdfunding model.
[2] Though the price for her tickets was higher than that
of tickets for comparable shows, it was still affordable to
most theatergoers—and reflected the real cost of the
performance. [3] She presented the total cost for
producing her play on a crowdfunding site. [4] Then she
divided the total cost by the number of people she
expected to attend the performance. [5] The result of the
calculation was the minimum donor price, and only
donors who paid at least the minimum ticket price were
allowed to attend the performance. [6] By subverting the
presumption that money used for her project is an
altruistic donation, the playwright showed that 31 our
work has monetary value to those who enjoy it. 32
