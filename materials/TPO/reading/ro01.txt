 Applied Arts and Fine Arts

Although we now tend to refer to the various crafts according to the materials used to construct them clay  glass  wood  fiber  and metal it was once common to think of crafts in terms of function  which led to their being known as the  applied arts   Approaching crafts from the point of view of function  we can divide them into simple categories  containers  shelters and supports  There is no way around the fact that containers  shelters  and supports must be functional  The applied arts are thus bound by the laws of physics  which pertain to both the materials used in their making and the substances and things to be contained  supported  and sheltered  These laws are universal in their application  regardless of cultural beliefs  geography  or climate  If a pot has no bottom or has large openings in its sides  it could hardly be considered a container in any traditional sense  Since the laws of physics  not some arbitrary decision  have determined the general form of applied art objects  they follow basic patterns  so much so that functional forms can vary only within certain limits  Buildings without roofs  for example  are unusual because they depart from the norm  However  not all functional objects are exactly alike  that is why we recognize a Shang Dynasty vase as being different from an Inca vase  What varies is not the basic form but the incidental details that do not obstruct the object s primary function  

Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the maker of applied art objects  It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the maker of fine art objects  This assumption misses a significant difference between the two disciplines  Fine art objects are not constrained by the laws of physics in the same way that applied art objects are  Because their primary purpose is not functional  they are only limited in terms of the materials used to make them  Sculptures must  for example  be stable  which requires an understanding of the properties of mass  weight distribution  and stress  Paintings must have rigid stretchers so that the canvas will be taut  and the paint must not deteriorate  crack  or discolor  These are problems that must be overcome by the artist because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of the work  For example  in the early Italian Renaissance  bronze statues of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof  This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg  In other words  the demands of the laws of physics  not the sculptor s aesthetic intentions  placed the ball there  That this device was a necessary structural compromise is clear from the fact that the cannonball quickly disappeared when sculptors learned how to strengthen the internal structure of a statue with iron braces  iron being much stronger than bronze   

Even though the fine arts in the twentieth century often treat materials in new ways  the basic difference in attitude of artists in relation to their materials in the fine arts and the applied arts remains relatively constant  It would therefore not be too great an exaggeration to say that practitioners of the fine arts work to overcome the limitations of their materials  whereas those engaged in the applied arts work in concert with their materials  









1  The word  they  in the passage refers to
 applied art objects 
 the laws of physics 
 containers 
 the sides of pots


2  Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence  Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information 

 Functional applied art objects cannot vary much from the basic patterns determined by the laws of physics  
 The function of applied art objects is determined by basic patterns in the laws of physics  
 Since functional applied art objects vary only within certain limits  arbitrary decisions cannot have determined their general form  
 The general form of applied art objects is limited by some arbitrary decision that is not determined by the laws of physics  

















  3  According to paragraph 2  sculptors in the Italian Renaissance stopped using cannonballs in bronze statues of horses because 
 they began using a material that made the statues weigh less 
 they found a way to strengthen the statues internally 
 the aesthetic tastes of the public had changed over time 
 the cannonballs added too much weight to the statues 
4  Why does the author discuss the bronze statues of horses created by artists in the early Italian Renaissance 
 To provide an example of a problem related to the laws of physics that a fine artist must overcome
 To argue that fine artists are unconcerned with the laws of physics
 To contrast the relative sophistication of modern artists in solving problems related to the laws of physics
 To note an exceptional piece of art constructed without the aid of technology

Answer Choices

 Applied art objects fulfill functions  such as containing or sheltering  and objects with the same function have similar characteristics because they are constrained by their purpose 
 It is easy to recognize that Shang Dynasty vases are different from Inca vases 
 Fine art objects are not functional  so they are limited only by the properties of the materials used 
 Renaissance sculptors learned to use iron braces to strengthen the internal structures of bronze statues 
 In the twentieth century  fine artists and applied artists became more similar to one another in their attitudes toward their materials 
 In all periods  fine artists tend to challenge the physical limitations of their materials while applied artists tend to cooperate with the physical properties of their materials
