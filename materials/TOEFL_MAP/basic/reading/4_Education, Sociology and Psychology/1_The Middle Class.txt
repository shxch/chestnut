The Middle Class

Sociologists often divide people into the upper, middle, and lower classes. This was once based on a family's social status. Today, it is often based on money and education. The upper class consists of the rich and well educated. The lower class consists of the poor. They often have little or no education. The middle class is more difficult to define. Members of the middle class have money. Yet they are not rich. They are often professionals. They may be teachers, engineers, scientists, and office managers. They often have at least a partial college education. Many middle class families own their own home. They usually have a car or two unless they live in big cities with good public transportation. These families have some savings so can afford a few luxuries and annual vacations. Still, they do not earn enough money to be considered upper class.
