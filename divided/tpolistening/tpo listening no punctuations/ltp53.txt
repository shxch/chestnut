Listen to part of a Lecture in an environmental science class

Professor
OK  now let s talk about another environmental concern soil erosion  It s a major problem  all around the world  Sometimes erosion damages soil so severely that the  land can no longer be cultivated and it s just abandoned  That happened in a big way right here in the United States  Some of you have probably read the novel The Grapes of Wrath  And maybe you remember that the story took place in the 1930s  during the time of what was called the Dust Bowl

Dust Bowl is a term we use to describe an ecological and human disaster that took place in the southern Great Plains region  For nearly eight years  dust and sand blew across the area and covered everything  It was so bad it even made breathing and eating difficult       and farmers could only look on helplessly as their crops were destroyed and the land       and their lives       ruined

Now  there d always been droughts and strong winds in that region  But that was OK because the native grasses had deep roots in the ground that were able to hold the soil in place  So the wind wasn t able to  you know  erode the soil too badly  This changed  though  between 1900 and 1930  Agriculture was expanding rapidly then  and lots of farmers in the southern Great Plains wanted to grow wheat and other crops they could sell for cash uh  crops that would be profitable  So they ripped up much of the grassland to plant these crops like wheat  which don t hold the soil
down nearly as well  At the same time  livestock uh  cattle  too many of them were feeding on grasses in the area and damaging a lot of the grassland  So these animals caused even more erosion of the soil
It didn t help that many of the actual owners of the land were not living anywhere near the area a lot of the landowners lived way back east  and rented out the land to local people who lived on the land and worked on it  but  um  didn t have much reason to take really good care of it  I mean  it wasn t their land  right  The tenant farmers weren t really interested in conserving someone else s soil not for the long term  anyway
Also  some thought the land couldn t really be damaged you know  that the soil was so rich and deep that       it didn t matter if the topsoil  the soil on the surface  blew away  They thought they could just plow up more  But they were wrong  Good top soil takes a long time to form it can literally take thousands of years to create good topsoil that will grow vegetation and a very short time to ruin it  So after only a few years of excessive plowing  the land pretty much couldn t be farmed anymore  And people moved on to other places and let the old areas just sit there  And when they didn t plant anything on that land  that made it vulnerable to even more erosion  So it was kind of a vicious cycle  you could say
Another problem  ironically  was that advances in technology were actually destroying the land  instead of improving it  A lot of farmers were using huge new tractors that dug deep into the ground and tore up a lot of the soil
And then  of course  there was the weather  You know  when people look back on the Dust Bowl era  they tend to blame the drought the lack of rain between 1934 and 1937  We can t ignore the drought l mean  it was the worst on record at the time and did help bring on this disaster  But without the soil destruction the drought alone wouldn t have resulted in the devastation we call the Dust Bowl  It was poor farming techniques that made that happen
Since then  though  we ve paid more attention to trying to prevent a future Dust Bowl  One thing Congress did was enact a massive government effort to improve soil conservation  called the Soil Erosion Act  Under this law  large stretches of land in the southern Great Plains were identified as being at risk for erosion and were taken out of production and turned into permanent grassland  What that did by protecting the land from excessive farming was to stabilize the soil  Also  the Soil Erosion Act helped educate farmers to practice better soil conservation techniques  like reducing how often they plowed and using better equipment that would  you know  minimize damage to the soil structure

A lot of the landowners lived way back east  and rented out the land to local people who lived on the land and worked on it  but  um  didn t have much reason to take really good care of it  I mean  it wasn t their land  right
Narrator
Why does the professor say this
Professor
I mean  it wasn t their land  right
