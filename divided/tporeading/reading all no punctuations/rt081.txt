The Rise of Teotihuacán
The city of Teotihuacán  which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of modern day Mexico City  began its growth by 200 100 B C  At its height  between about A D  150 and 700  it probably had a population of more than 125 000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers  It had over 2 000 apartment complexes  a great market  a large number of industrial workshops  an administrative center  a number of massive religious edifices  and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings  Clearly  much planning and central control were involved in the expansion and ordering of this great metropolis   Moreover  the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica  modern Central America and Mexico
How did this tremendous development take place  and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley  Among the main factors are Teotihuacán s geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico  the obsidian resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself  and the valley s potential for extensive irrigation  The exact role of other factors is much more difficult to pinpoint―for instance  Teotihuacán s religious significance as a shrine  the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first millennium B C   the ingenuity and foresightedness of Teotihuacán s elite  and  finally  the impact of natural disasters  such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B C
This last factor is at least circumstantially implicated in Teotihuacán s rise  Prior to 200 B C   a number of relatively small centers coexisted in and near the Valley of Mexico  Around this time  the largest of these centers  Cuicuilco  was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption  with much of its agricultural land covered by lava  With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival  any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico  The archaeological evidence clearly indicates  though  that Teotihuacán was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A D
It seems likely that Teotihuacán s natural resources  along with the city elite s ability to recognize their potential  gave the city a competitive edge over its neighbors  The valley  like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands  was rich in obsidian  The hard volcanic stone was a resource that had been in great demand for many years  at least since the rise of the Olmecs  a people who flourished between 1200 and 400 B C    and it apparently had a secure market  Moreover  recent research on obsidian tools found at Olmec sites has shown that some of the obsidian obtained by the Olmecs originated near Teotihuacán  Teotihuacán obsidian must have been recognized as a valuable commodity for many centuries before the great city arose
Long distance trade in obsidian probably gave the elite residents of Teotihuacán access to a wide variety of exotic good  as well as a relatively prosperous life  Such success may have attracted immigrants to Teotihuacán  In addition  Teotihuacán s elite may have consciously attempted to attract new inhabitants  It is also probable that as early as 200 B C  Teotihuacán may have achieved some religious significance and its shrine  or shrines  may have served as an additional population magnet  Finally  the growing population was probably fed by increasing the number and size of irrigated fields
The picture of Teotihuacán that emerges is a classic picture of positive feedback among obsidian mining and working  trade  population growth  irrigation  and religious tourism  The thriving obsidian operation  for example  would necessitate more miners  additional manufacturers of obsidian tools  and additional traders to carry the goods to new markets  All this led to increased wealth  which in turn would attract more immigrants to Teotihuacán  The growing power of the elite  who controlled the economy  would give them the means to physically coerce people to move to Teotihuacán and serve as additions to the labor force  More irrigation works would have to be built to feed the growing population  and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite

Teotihuacán was a highly developed city in Mesoamerica that reached its peak between about A D  150 and 700











Answer choices

 The number and sophistication of the architectural  administrative  commercial  and religious features of Teotihuacan indicate the existence of centralized planning and control
 Teotihuacán may have developed its own specific local religion as a result of the cultural advances made possible by the city s great prosperity
 As a result of its large number of religious shrines  by the first century A D   Teotihuacan become the most influential religious center in all of Mesoamerica

 In many important areas  from the obsidian industry to religious tourism  Teotihuacán s success and prosperity typified the classic positive feedback cycle
 Although many immigrants settled in Teotihuacán between A D 150 and 700  the increasing threat of coerced labor discouraged further settlement and limited Teotihuacán s population growth
