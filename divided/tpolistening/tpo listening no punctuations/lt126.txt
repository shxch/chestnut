TPO12 Lecture 4 Environmental science

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class

Professor
All right folks  let s continue our discussion of alternative energy sources and move on to what s probably the most well known alternative energy source    solar energy  The sun basically provides Earth with virtually unlimited source of energy everyday  but the problem has always been how do we tap this source of energy  Can anyone think of why it s so difficult to make use of solar energy

Student A
Because it is hard to gather it

Professor
That s exactly it  Solar energy is everywhere  but it s also quite diffused  And the thing is the dream of solar energy is not a new one  Humanity has been trying to use the sun s light as a reliable source of energy for centuries  And around the beginning of the 20th century there were actually some primitive solar water heaters on the consumer market  But they didn t sell very well  Any of you wanna guess why

Student A
Well  there were other energy choices like oil and natural gas  right

Professor
Yeah  And for better or for worse  we chose to go down that path as a society  When you consider economic factors  it s easy to see why  But then in the 1970s  there was an interest in solar energy again  Why do you think that happened

Student B
Because oil and natural gas were   err   became scarce

Professor
Well  not exactly  The amount of oil and natural gas in the Earth was still plentiful  but there were other reasons  It s a political thing really and I m gonna get into that now  So what happened in the 1970s was oil and natural gas became very expensive very quickly  and that spurred people to start looking into alternative forms of energy  solar energy probably being the most popular  But then in the 80s  this trend reversed itself when the price of oil and natural gas went down

Alright  let s shift our focus now to some of the technologies that have been invented to overcome the problem of gathering diffused solar energy  The most basic solution is simply to carefully place windows in a building  so that the sun shines into the building and then it s absorbed and converted into heat  Can anyone think of where this is most commonly used

Student A
Greenhouses

Professor
Yep  greenhouses where plants are kept warm and provided with sunlight  because the walls of the building are made entirely of glass  But we do also have more complex systems that are used for space heating and they fall into two categories  passive and active heating systems

Passive systems take advantage of the location or design of a house  For example  solar energy is gathered through large glass panels facing the sun  The heat is then stored in water filled tanks or concrete  No mechanical devices are used in passive heating systems  They operate with little or no mechanical assistance

With active systems  on the other hand  you collect the solar energy at one location  and then you use pumps and fans to move heat from the collectors through a plumbing system to a tank  where it can be used to heat a home or to just provide hot water

Student B
Excuse me  professor  but I ve got to ask  how can solar energy work at night or on cloudy days

Professor
That s   Well   that is a really good question  As a matter of facts  science is still working on it  trying to find ways of enhancing energy storage techniques so that the coming of night or cloudy days really wouldn t matter  That is the biggest drawback to solar energy  The problem of what do you do in cases where the sun s light is weak or virtually non present  So the storage of solar energy  lots of solar energy  is a really important aspect

Student A
Does that mean that solar energy can only be used on a small scale  like heating a home

Professor
Well actually  there have been some attempts to build solar energy power plants  The world s largest solar power plant is located in Kremer Junction California  It can generate 194 megawatts of electric power  but that s just a drop in the bucket  Right now the utility companies are interested in increasing the capacity of the Kremer Junction Plant  but only time will tell if it will ever develop into a major source of power for that region  considering the economic and political factors involved
