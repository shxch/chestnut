Feeding Habits of East African Herbivores
Buffalo  zebras  wildebeests  topi  and Thomson s gazelles live in huge groups that together make up some 90 percent of the total weight of mammals living on the Serengeti Plain of East Africa  They are all herbivores  plant eating animals   and they all appear to be living on the same diet of grasses  herbs  and small bushes  This appearance  however  is illusory  When biologist Richard Bell and his colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of four of the five species  they did not study buffalo   they found that each species was living on a different part of the vegetation  The different vegetational parts differ in their food qualities  lower down  there are succulent  nutritious leaves  higher up are the harder stems  There are also sparsely distributed  highly nutritious fruits  and Bell found that only the Thomson s gazelles eat much of these  The other three species differ in the proportion of lower leaves and higher stems that they eat  zebras eat the most stem matter  wildebeests eat the most leaves  and topi are intermediate

How are we to understand their different feeding preferences  The answer lies in two associated differences among the species  in their digestive systems and body sizes  According to their digestive systems  these herbivores can be divided into two categories  the nonruminants  such as the zebra  which has a digestive system like a horse  and the ruminants  such as the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle  which are like the cow   Nonruminants cannot extract much energy from the hard parts of a plant  however  this is more than made up for by the fast speed at which food passes through their guts  Thus  when there is only a short supply of poor quality food  the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle enjoy an advantage  They are ruminants and have a special structure  the rumen  in their stomachs  which contains microorganisms that can break down the hard parts of plants  Food passes only slowly through the ruminant s gut because ruminating digesting the hard parts takes time  The ruminant continually regurgitates food from its stomach back to its mouth to chew it up further  that is what a cow is doing when  chewing cud    Only when it has been chewed up and digested almost to a liquid can the food pass through the rumen and on through the gut  Larger particles cannot pass through until they have been chewed down to size  Therefore  when food is in short supply  a ruminant can last longer than a nonruminant because it can derive more energy out of the same food  The difference can partially explain the eating habits of the Serengeti herbivores  The zebra chooses areas where there is more low quality food  It migrates first to unexploited areas and chomps the abundant low quality stems before moving on  It is a fast in fast out feeder  relying on a high output of incompletely digested food  By the time the wildebeests  and other ruminants  arrive  the grazing and trampling of the zebras will have worn the vegetation down  As the ruminants then set to work  they eat down to the lower  leafier parts of the vegetation  All of this fits in with the differences in stomach contents with which we began

The other part of the explanation is body size  Larger animals require more food than smaller animals  but smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate  Smaller animals can therefore live where there is less food  provided that such food is of high energy content  That is why the smallest of the herbivores  Thomson s gazelle  lives on fruit that is very nutritious but too thin on the ground to support a larger animal  By contrast  the large zebra lives on the masses of low quality stem material

The differences in feeding preferences lead  in turn  to differences in migratory habits  The wildebeests follow  in their migration  the pattern of local rainfall  The other species do likewise  But when a new area is fueled by rain  the mammals migrate toward it in a set order to exploit it  The larger  less fastidious feeders  the zebras  move in first  the choosier  smaller wildebeests come later  and the smallest species of all  Thomson s gazelle  arrives last  The later species all depend on the preparations of the earlier one  for the actions of the zebra alter the vegetation to suit the stomachs of the wildebeest  topi  and gazelle

5  The author mentions the cow and the horse in paragraph 2 in order to
 distinguish the functioning of their digestive systems from those of East African animals
 emphasize that their relatively large body size leads them to have feeding practices similar to those of East African mammals

 The zebra
 The topi
7  Paragraph 2 suggests that which of the following is one of the most important factors in determining differences in feeding preferences of East African herbivores
 The availability of certain foods

12  According to the passage  which of the following is true of wildebeests
 They eat more stem matter than zebras do
 They are able to digest large food particles if the food is of a high quality
 They tend to choose feeding areas in which the vegetation has been worn down
 They are likely to choose low quality food to eat in periods when the quantity of rainfall is low

13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

East African herbivores  though they all live in the same environment  have a range of feeding preferences





Answer Choices

 The survival of East African mammals depends more than anything else on the quantity of highly nutritious fruits that they are able to find
 A herbivore s size and metabolic rate affect the kinds of food and the quantities of food it needs to eat
 Zebras and wildebeests rarely compete for the same food resources in the same locations
 The different digestive systems of herbivores explain their feeding preferences
 Migratory habits are influenced by feeding preferences
 Patterns in the migratory habits of East African herbivores are hard to establish
