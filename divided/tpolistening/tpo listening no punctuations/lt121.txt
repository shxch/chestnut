Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor

Student
So Professor Tibbits  your notes said that you wanted to see me about my Hemingway paper  I have to say that grade wasn t what I was expecting  I thought I d done a pretty good job

Professor
Oh  you did  But do you really want to settle for pretty good when you can do
something very good

Student
You think it can be very good

Professor
Absolutely

Student
Would that mean you d…I could get a better grade

Professor
Oh  sorry  It s not for your grade  It s…I think you could learn a lot by revising it

Student
You mean  rewrite the whole thing  I m really swamped  There s deadlines wherever I turn and… and I don t really know how much time I could give it

Professor
Well  it is a busy time  with spring break coming up next week  It s your call
But I think that with a little extra effort  you can really turn this into a fine essay

Student
No… yeah…I mean  after I read your comments  I   I can see how it tries to do
too much

Professor
Yeah  It s just too ambitious for the scope of the assignment

Student
So I should cut out the historical part

Professor
Yes  I would just stick to the topic  Anything unrelated to the use of nature imagery has no place in the paper  All that tangential material just distracts from the main argument

Student
Yeah  I never know how much to include  You know…where to draw the line

Professor
Tell me about it  All writers struggle with that one  But it s something you can learn  That will become more clear with practice  But I think if you just cut out the…um…

Student
The stuff about the history  but if I cut out those sections  won t it be too short

Professor
Well  better a short well structured paper than a long paper that s poorly structured and wanders off topic

Student
So all I have to do is delete those sections

Professor
Well  not so fast  After you cut out those sections  you ll have to go back and revise the rest  to see how it all fits together  And of course  you ll have to revise the introduction too  to accurately describe what you do in the body of the paper  But that shouldn t be too difficult  Just remember to keep the discussion focused  Do you think you can get it to me by noon tomorrow

Student
Wow…um…I have so much…er…but I ll try

Professor
OK  good  Do try  But if you can t  well  shoot for after spring break  OK
