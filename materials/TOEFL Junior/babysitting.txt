Questions 18-23 are about the following story.
Edward rang the Millers’ doorbell. Mr. and Mrs. Miller had moved into the neighborhood
last month. They had a five-year-old son, and they had asked Edward to watch him that
evening while they went out.
“Hello, Edward,” Mrs. Miller said as she opened the door.
Mr. Miller stood behind her with a boy at his side. “This is Lucas,” Mr. Miller said.
“Lucas, this is Edward. He will watch you tonight while Mom and I are out.”
The little boy waved shyly to Edward. The Millers asked Edward to entertain Lucas for
an hour and then put him in bed.
After Lucas’s parents left, Edward went with the boy to his room. They played some
games and built a tower out of wooden blocks.
“It’s time for you to go to sleep now,” Edward said. Lucas looked disappointed, but he
changed into his pajamas and got into bed.
“Will you read me a story?” he asked Edward.
Edward took a picture book from the shelf and read it to Lucas. When he finished reading
the book to Lucas, he turned out the light and said good night. But as soon as Edward left
the room, Lucas called out to him.
“What’s wrong?” Edward asked.
“I’m afraid of the dark,” Lucas explained.
Edward turned on the small light by Lucas’s bed. “Good night,” Edward said again.
Five minutes later, Lucas cried out again.
“What’s wrong now?” Edward asked.
“I thought I heard a sound,” Lucas said. “I think there might be a monster under my bed.”
Edward explained that there was no monster under the bed, but Lucas was still afraid.
Finally, Edward went to the kitchen and found a flashlight. He shined the flashlight under
Lucas’s bed. “See?” he said. “No monster.”
“Will you stay with me in case one comes?” Lucas begged.
Edward could see that the little boy was frightened. He agreed to sit in the chair by
Lucas’s bed, with the flashlight in his hand.
Edward sat in the chair, waiting for Lucas to fall asleep. The dim light in the room and
the soft chair made Edward feel tired, too. He closed his eyes.
The next thing he knew someone was shaking him gently. Edward opened his eyes and
saw Mr. and Mrs. Miller.
“We’re home,” Mrs. Miller whispered. “Thank you for taking care of Lucas. We had
a wonderful evening.”
Edward shook himself in amazement. Was the evening over already?
