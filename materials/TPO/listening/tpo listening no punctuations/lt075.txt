Pro  So we ve been discussing 16th century Native American life  and today we re going to focus on the Iroquois and Huron peoples  They lived in the northeastern great lakes region of North America  Now  back then  their lifes depended on the natural resources of the forests  especially the birch tree  The birch tree can grow in many different types of soils and is prevalent in that area  Now can anyone here describe a birch tree

Stu  They are tall and white  the bark  I mean

Pro  Yes  The birch tree has white bark  and this tough protective outer layer of the tree  this white bark  is waterproof  And this waterproof quality of the bark  it made it useful for making things like cooking containers  a variety of utensils  And if you peel birch bark in the winter  we call it  the winter bark   another layer  a tougher inner layer of the tree adheres to the bark  producing a stronger material  So the winter bark was used for larger utensils and containers

Stu  I know people make utensils out of wood  but utensils out of tree bark

Pro  Well  birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend  The Native Americans would cut the bark and fold it into any shape they needed  then secure it with cords until it dried  They could fold the bark into many shapes

Stu  So if they cooked in bowls made of birch bark  wouldn t that make the food taste funny

Pro  Oh  that s one of the great things about birch bark  The taste of the birch tree doesn t get transferred to the food  So it was perfect for cooking containers

But the most important use of the bark  by far  was the canoe  Since the northeast region of North American is interconnected by many streams and waterways  water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential  The paths through the woods were often overgrown  so water travel was much faster  And here s what the Native Americans did  They would peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy canoes  The bark was stretched over frames made from tree branches  stitched together and sealed with resin  You know that sticky liquid that comes out of the tree  And when it dries  it s watertight

One great thing about these birch bark canoes was  uh  they could carry a large amount of cargo  For example  a canoe weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of cargo

Stu  Wow  But how far could they travel that way

Pro  Well like I said  the northeastern region is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the coast  The canoes allow them to travel over a vast area that today would take a few hours to fly over  You see  the Native Americans made canoes of all types  for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters  For small streams  they made narrow  maneuverable boats  while  while larger canoes were needed for the ocean  They could travel throughout the area only occasionally having to portage  to carry the canoe over a land short distance to another nearby stream  And since the canoes were so light  this wasn t a difficult task

Now how do you think this affected their lives

Stu  Well if they could travel so easily over such a large area  they could trade with people from other areas which I guess would lead them to form alliances

Pro  Exactly  Having an efficient means of transportation  well  that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by natural waterways  And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Dalever River  And this efficiency of the birch bark canoe also made an impression on newcomers to the area  French traders in the 17th century modeled their   well they adopted the design of the Iroquois birch bark canoes  and they found they could travel great distances more than 15 kilometers a month

Now besides the bark  Native Americans also used the wood of the birch tree  The young trees were used as supports for lodgings  with the waterproof bark used as roofing  Branches were folded into snowshoes  And the Native American people were all adept at running very fast over the snow in these birch branch snowshoes  which if you ever tried walking in snowshoes you know it wasn t easy
