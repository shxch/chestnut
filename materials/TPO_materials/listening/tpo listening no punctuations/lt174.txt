TPO 17 Conversation 2

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a food service manager

Student
Excuse me  Mrs  Hanson  My name is John  John Grant  I work as a waiter in the campus dining hall  in the faculty dining room

Manager
What can I do for you  John

Student
Well  I work week nights  except for Friday  I was wondering if I could switch from working the dinner service to working at lunch

Manager
That s going to be a problem  I am afraid we don t have any openings at lunch time  A lot of students want to work then  so it is really rare for us to have an open spot at that time of day

Student
Oh  you see  I have joined this group  the University Jazz Band  and the band s practice time is right around dinner time  You know  it is so hard to get into this group  I must have auditioned like ten times since I have been at the school  so I am     Anyway  so I was really hoping to have the dinner hour free so I can go to practice

Manager
Well  we do have other open times  like breakfast

Student
Eh  that won t work  I am sorry  I mean that  I can t work that early  I have this very important music class I got to take  and it is like  first thing in the morning


Manager
Well  if you don t mind working in the kitchen  we ve got some pretty flexible hours for students doing food prep work  anything from early morning to late afternoon

Student
What s prep work

Manager
You prepare food for the cooks  You know  like cutting up vegetables for soup  or cleaning greens for salads

Student
Oh  that doesn t sound  I mean    Being a waiter  I get to see a lot of the professors  like in a different light  we joke around a little you know  In the classroom  they always have to be pretty formal  but

Manager
Well  the money is no different since we pay students the same amount for any of the jobs here in food service  so it s up to you

Student
Oh  man  I always thought that sacrificing for my art  that d mean working long hours as a musician for  like  no money  I didn t think it d mean  peeling carrots

Manager
Let me see  I am offering you something that has the hours you want  it is right here on campus  and you make as much money as you did being a waiter  quite a sacrifice

Student
I am sorry  I know you are just trying to help  I guess I should look into the food prep
job


Manager
Ok  then  I ll tell the kitchen manager that you will stop by tomorrow to talk about the job and schedule your hours  And I will let the dining hall manager know that he needs to find a new waiter for the evening

Student
Oh  ok  I guess that  s it  Thanks  Mrs  Hanson
