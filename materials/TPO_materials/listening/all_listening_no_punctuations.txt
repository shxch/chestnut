Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a librarian 

Student
Hi  um…  I really hope you can help me 

Librarian
That s why I m here  What can I do for you 

Student
I m supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course  but I m… having a hard time finding articles  I don t even know where to start looking 

Librarian
You said this is for your psychology course  right  So your focus is on …

Student
Dream Interpretation 

Librarian
Well  you have a focus  so that s already a good start  Hmmm… well  there re a few things… oh wait… have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve 

Student
Aha  that s one thing I did know to do  I just copied an article  but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals 

Librarian
Let s get you going on looking for those then  We have printed versions of twenty or so psychology journals in the Reference Section  These are ones published within the last year  Now that I think about it… there s a journal named Sleep and Dreams 

Student
Oh  yeah  the article I just copied is from that journal  so I ve got to look in other sources 

Librarian
Ok  actually  most of our materials are available electronically now  You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library s computers  and if you want to search by title with the word  dream  for example  just type it in and all the articles with  dream  in the title will come up on the screen  

Student
Cool  that s great  Too bad I cannot do this from home 

Librarian
But you can  All of the library s databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network 

Student
Really   I can t believe I didn t know that  It still sounds like it s going to take a while though  you know  going through all of that information  all of those sources 

Librarian
Maybe  but you already narrowed your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation  so it shouldn t be too bad  And you probably notice that there s an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied  When you go into the databases and electronic sources  you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen  skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time  

Student
Right  abstracts  They ll definitely make the project more doable  I guess I should try out the electronic search while I m still here then  you know  just in case 

Librarian
Sure  er… that computer s free over there  and I ll be here till five this afternoon 

Student
Thanks  I feel a lot better about this assignment now 
 
TPO 1 Lecture 1 Contemporary art
Listen to part of a lecture in a contemporary art class 

Professor
Ok  I m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment  Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it  Well  the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up  It s already started in fact  but it ll be at the gallery for the next month  which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment  

The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen  Frantzen s work may be unfamiliar to you since she s a relatively young artist  But she s got a very unusual style  compared to some of the artists we ve looked at this term  But anyway  Frantzen s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism  So you ve probably studied both of these movements separately  separate movements  Realism and Impressionism  in some of your art history courses  So who can just sum these up 

Student
Well  Impressionism started in the late 19th century  Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles  It didn t depict scenes or models exactly as they looked  Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly  and in big brushstrokes  so the texture of the canvas was rough 

Professor
Good  What else  What were the subjects 

Student
Well  a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes  like people on the streets and in cafes  uh  lots of nature scenes  especially landscapes 

Professor
Good  So when you go to the exhibit  I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting  It s a farm scene  And you will see it right as you enter the gallery  The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen s style  It s an outdoor scene  an everyday scene  It s kind of bleak  but you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines  The colors aren t quite realistic  The sky is kind of  well an unnatural pinkish yellow  And the fence in the foreground is blue  but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold  bleak winter day on a farm  So that s the impressionist side of her work  

Oh  and speaking about farms  that reminds me  One interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad  she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn  And the Sales Barn  it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle  their farm animals  And the reason Frantzen went there  and she later on would visit other places like dance halls  was to observe people and the ways that they moved  She really found that this helped her work   that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions  how humans move  and stand still  what their postures were like  too  

So  what about Realism  What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen s work 

Student
Um… real honest depictions of subject matter  pretty unidealized stuff  and pretty everyday subject matter  too 

Professor
Good  One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins  You will notice that the woman s face is so realistic looking that it s almost like a photograph  The woman s nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up  This is realism  But then  the background of the painting  this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes  and  it s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines  kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close  And there are vibrant colors  There s lots of orange  with little hints of an electric blue peeking out  

I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist  I mean  some artists  to appreciate them  you have to know their life story  But here s a little bit about Rose Frantzen s life anyway  She attended art school  but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration  that she should go into advertising instead  So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too  until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good  that she could be an artist  But of course  it s not as easy as that  and so Frantzen had to paint other people s portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more serious art work  No matter what  she never stopped painting  And now  Frantzen is doing extremely well  And her work is being shown all over the country  So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that  But what s important is that you keep at it that you don t give up  That s what is really important to remember  

 
TPO 1 Lecture2 Geology
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class 

Professor
Ok  let s get started  Great  Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land  or some other geologic feature is   dating techniques  I m going to talk about a particular dating technique  Why  Good dating is key to good analysis  In other words  if you want to know how a land formation was formed  the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is  It s fundamental  

Uh… Take the Grand Canyon for instance  Now  we geologists thought we had a pretty good idea of how the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed  We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago  Before it solidified  it was just regular sand  Essentially it was part of a vast desert  And until just recently  most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time  That s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time  

But now we ve learned something different  and quite surprising  using a technique called Uranium Lead Dating  I should say that Uranium Lead Dating has been around for quite a while  But there have been some recent refinements  I will get into this in a minute  Anyway  Uranium Lead Dating has produced some surprises  Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains  That s really eye opening news  since the Appalachian Mountain Range is  of course  thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon  Sounds pretty unbelievable  right  Of course  the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west  The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there  

Well  this was a pretty revolutionary finding  Um… and it was basically because of Uranium Lead Dating  Why  Well  as everyone in this class should know  we usually look at the grain type within sandstone  meaning the actual particles in the sandstone  to determine where it came from  You can do other things too  like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing  But that s only useful up to a point  and that s not what these two geologists did  

Uranium Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way  What they did was  they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone  Zircon is a material that contains radioactive Uranium  which makes it very useful for dating purposes  Zircon starts off as molten magma  the hot lava from volcanoes  This magma then crystallizes  And when Zircon crystallizes  the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead  So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain  you can figure out when the grain was formed  After that  you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges  Once you do that  you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains  If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges  then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range  Is everybody with me on that  Good  So  in this case  Uranium Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite in the Appalachian Mountains was formed  So because of this  this new way of doing Uranium Lead Dating  we ve been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong  

Like I said before  Uranium Lead Dating has been with us for a while  But  um… until recently  in order to do it  you really had to study many individual grains  And it took a long time before you got results  It just wasn t very efficient  And it wasn t very accurate  But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study  so you get your results faster  So I ll predict that Uranium Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method  

There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium Lead Dating  Here is one that comes to mind  You know the theory that earth s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently  Well  with Uranium Lead Dating  we could prove that more conclusively  If they show evidence of once having been joined  that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet s geology  

 
TPO 1 Conversation 2

Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor 

Professor
Hi Mathew  I m glad you could come in today  You ve been observing Mr  Grable s third grade class for your approaches to education paper  right 

Student
Um  yes  I go over to Johnson Elementary School  you know  to watch Mr  Grable teach the children in class  It s been amazing  I mean  I m just learning so much from just watching him  I m so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program  I mean it s like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher 

Professor
Well  I m glad to see you feel that way  Mathew  You know  that s the goal  So  I ve been reading over your observation notes and I m quite interested in what s going on  in particular with the astronomy unit he s been teaching 

Student
The astronomy unit 

Professor
It seems that Mr  Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary approach to teaching that we ve been talking about in class 

Student
Oh  OK  yeah  so like when he was teaching them astronomy  he didn t just teach them the names of the planets  he used it as a way to teach mythology 

Professor
Really  So  how did he do that 

Student
Well  some of the students could already name the planets  but they didn t know that the names had any meaning   the stories behind them 

Professor
So  he…

Student
He introduced Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaining  Like  you know  how like Jupiter s the biggest planet  right  and how Jupiter was the name of the king of the gods in Roman mythology  right  So since Jupiter  the planet  is the largest planet in our solar system  it s like the king of the planets  like Jupiter was the king of all the gods 

Professor
Oh  Mathew  that s a great example 

Student
Yeah  And each student chose a planet and then did research on it to write a report and make a presentation  They went to the library to do the research  then they made presentations about the planet they chose 

Professor
So  in one science unit  in which the focus was astronomy  the students also learned about the literature of Greek and Roman mythology  used research skills in the library  wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skills 

Student
Exactly  He used this one topic to teach third graders all that stuff   how to use the books in the library  to write reports  and even how to speak in public  Plus they had a great time doing it  

Professor
You know  Mathew  this is just what we ve been talking about in our class  I m sure everyone can learn something from your experience  You know  Mathew  I d love for you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday 

Student
Really   Um…  cause I don t really think I ll have any time to write my paper by then 

Professor
Oh  you won t need to write anything new just yet  For Wednesday  use your class observation notes and explain the things we ve discussed today 

Student
Ok  that sounds all right 
 
TPO 1 Lecture 3 Archeology

Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class 

Professor
OK  we ve been talking about early agriculture in the near east  So let s concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it  Let s look at Catalhoyuk  Um… I d better write that down  Catalhoyuk  that s about as close as we get in English  It s Turkish  really  The site s in modern day Turkey  and who knows what the original inhabitants called it  Anyway  uh…Catalhoyuk wasn t the first agricultural settlement in the near east  but it was pretty early  settled about 9 000 years ago in the Neolithic period  And     um    the settlement   uh   town really  lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people  That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time  

One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period  It s the Neolithic  remember  the late Stone Age  So the people that lived there had only stone tools  no metals  So everything they accomplished  like building this town  they did with just stone  plus wood  bricks  that sort of thing  But you got to remember that it wasn t just any stone they had  they had obsidian  And um    obsidian is a black  volcanic  well  almost like glass  It flakes very nicely into really sharp points  The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian  And uh    the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland  from central Turkey  traded for it  probably  

Anyway  what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built  The houses are all rectangular  one storey  made of sun dried bricks  But what s really interesting is that there are no spaces between them  no streets in other words  and so generally no doors on the houses either  People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof  down a wooden ladder  You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls  Once you were in the house  there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage  The main room had the hearths  for cooking and for heat  It would ve been pretty cold during the winters  And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire  There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes  but no chimney  The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves  So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out  You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there  You can see on the walls  which they plastered and decorated with paintings  They ended up with a layer of black soot on them  and so did people s lungs  The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs  

And that s another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk  the burial sites  The graves have all been found under the houses  right under the floors  And it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets  I mean  you might think it was for protection or something  but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger  It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors  graves and be buried near them themselves  But it makes a good point  Based on excavations  we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves  but we re only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way  That s the way it is with archeology  You are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind  We have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things  I mean it s interesting to speculate  And the physical artifacts can give us clues  but there is a lot we can t really know  So  for instance  their art  They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them  Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep  but we don t know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes  Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance  That s the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues  And hopefully  further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more clues  But we ll probably never know for sure  

 
TPO 1 Lecture 4 Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor
For today s discussion  we ll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments  Now you had to read about two animal species  the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot  Marmots are rodents  They are large ground squirrels  about the size of an average house cat  And they live in a variety of habitats  And even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating  according to this case study  marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies  Why is that 

Student
Well  when they are not hibernating  you can find them in open areas  And they are pretty active during the day  which makes them easy to observe  right 

Professor
Uh huh  so first let s discuss the Eastern marmots  They reside throughout the eastern region of North America where there is a temperate climate  where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year  which is when they do all their mating  playing and eating 

Student
Oh  I see  At first I wasn t sure what growing season meant  just from the reading  But now I get it  It s the amount of time it takes for them to grow  right  So it would be five months  

Professor
Umm  Oh  uh… I m sorry but no  It has nothing to do with that  It s not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to grow  It s when the food is available  That is when it s not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and  umm  vegetative parts of a plant s herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat  So growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat  OK  So now how would you describe the Eastern marmots  social habits 

Student
Well  they are really territorial  and loners  and just so aggressive even with other Eastern marmots  And their mating ritual is just so impersonal 

Professor
Uh huh  Now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation  the mating process begins  For them  well  they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways  Then about six to eight weeks after birth  the offspring leave their mothers 

Student
Really  Just six weeks  Is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young 

Professor
Well  it s not as if they aren t ready for the real world because they are  Remember  they mature quickly and the weather s nice  Also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation  So roughly six weeks after birth  Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment  So how does this relate to their behavior 

Student
Oh  I get it  Since the climate s not too bad  the Eastern marmots don t have to rely on each other too much and they really don t need to stay together as a family to survive either 

Professor
Uh ha  Any contrast  the Olympic marmots  What about them 
Student
Well  they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old  They re really friendly with each other  And what I really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies  And they are not at all aggressive and territorial like the Eastern marmots  So their social behavior is so different from Eastern marmots because of the climate where they live  That seems so bizarre 

Professor
Well  the Olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher  So there is a lot more wind and snow  The growing season only lasts about two to three months  So in that much shorter period of time  all the Olympic marmots  male and female  eat  play  work and nurture the young together  Because the climate is so harsh  cooperation increases the survival rate of the Olympic marmots  They keep their young at home until they are physically able to survive on their own  This could explain why the social behavior of the Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Eastern marmots

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor 

Student
Uh  excuse me  Professor Thompson  I know your office hours are tomorrow  but I was wondering if you had a few minutes free now to discuss something 

Professor
Sure  John  What did you want to talk about 

Student
Well  I have some quick questions about how to write up the research project I did this semester about climate variations 

Professor
Oh  yes  You were looking at variations in climate in the Grant City area  right  How far along have you gotten 

Student
I ve got all my data  so I m starting to summarize it now  preparing graphs and stuff  But I m just      I m looking at it and I m afraid that it s not enough  but I m not sure what else to put in the report 

Professor
I hear the same thing from every student  You know  you have to remember now that you re the expert on what you ve done  So  think about what you d need to include if you were going to explain your research project to someone with general or casual knowledge about the subject  like       like your parents  That s usually my rule of thumb  would my parents understand this 

Student
OK  I get it 

Professor
I hope you can recognize by my saying that how much you do know about the subject 

Student
Right  I understand  I was wondering if I should also include the notes from the research journal
you suggested I keep 

Professor
Yes  definitely  You should use them to indicate what your evolution in thought was through time  So  just set up  you know  what was the purpose of what you were doing to try to understand the climate variability of this area and what you did  and what your approach was 

Student
OK  So  for example  I studied meteorological records  I looked at climate charts  I used different methods for analyzing the data  like certain statistical tests  and then I discuss the results  Is that what you mean 

Professor
Yes  that s right  You should include all of that  The statistical tests are especially important  And also be sure you include a good reference section where all your published and unpublished data came from   cause you have a lot of unpublished climate data 

Student
Hmm       something just came into my mind and went out the other side 

Professor
That happens to me a lot  so I ve come up with a pretty good memory management tool  I carry a little pad with me all the time and jot down questions or ideas that I don t want to forget  For example  I went to the doctor with my daughter and her baby son last week and we knew we wouldn t remember everything we wanted to ask the doctor  so we actually made a list of five things we wanted answers to 

Student
A notepad is a good idea  Since I m so busy now at the end of the semester  I m getting pretty forgetful these days  OK  I just remembered what I was trying to say before 

Professor
Good  I was hoping you d come up with it 

Student
Yes  It ends up that I have data on more than just the immediate Grant City area  so I also included some regional data in the report  With everything else it should be a pretty good indicator of the climate in this part of the state 

Professor
Sounds good  I d be happy to look over a draft version before you hand in the final copy  if you wish 

Student
Great  I ll plan to get you a draft of the paper by next Friday  Thanks very much  Well  see ya 

Professor
OK 
 
TPO2 Lecture 1 Psychology
Narrator
Listen to part of a psychology lecture  The professor is discussing behaviorism 

Professor
Now  many people consider John Watson to be the founder of behaviorism  And like other behaviorists  he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can observe and measure  They re not interested in mental processes  While a person could describe his thoughts  no one else can see or hear them to verify the accuracy of his report  But one thing you can observe is muscular habits  What Watson did was to observe muscular habits because he viewed them as a manifestation of thinking  One kind of habits that he studied are laryngeal habits  

Watson thought laryngeal habits       you know  from larynx  in other words  related to the voice box       he thought those habits were an expression of thinking  He argued that for very young children  thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud even if they re not trying to communicate with someone in particular  As the individual matures  that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself  but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit  One of the bits of evidence that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem  they  um  typically have increased muscular activity in the throat region  That is  if you put electrodes on the throat and measure muscle potential muscle activity you discover that when people are thinking  like if they re diligently trying to solve a problem  that there is muscular activity in the throat region  

So  Watson made the argument that problem solving  or thinking  can be defined as a set of behaviors a set of responses and in this case the response he observed was the throat activity  That s what he means when he calls it a laryngeal habit  Now  as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying  my muscles in my throat are responding  So  thinking can be measured as muscle activity  Now  the motor theory       yes  

Student
Professor Blake  um  did he happen to look at people who sign  I mean deaf people 

Professor
Uh  he did indeed  um  and to jump ahead  what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they re given problems of various kinds  they have muscular changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem       muscle changes in the hand  just like the muscular changes going on in the throat region for speaking individuals  

So  for Watson  thinking is identical with the activity of muscles  A related concept of thinking was developed by William James  It s called ideomotor action  

Ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it  without our being aware of it  I ll give you one simple example  If you think of locations  there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location  In particular  from where we re sitting  imagine that you re asked to think of our university library  Well  if you close your eyes and think of the library  and if you re sitting directly facing me  then according to this notion  your eyeballs will move slightly to the left  to your left   cause the library s in that general direction  

James and others said that this is an idea leading to a motor action  and that s why it s called  ideomotor action  an idea leads to motor activity  If you wish to impress your friends and relatives  you can change this simple process into a magic trick  Ask people to do something such as I ve just described  think of something on their left  think of something on their right  You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed  and you watch their eyes very carefully  And if you do that  you ll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement that is  you can see the movement of the eyeballs  Now  then you say  think of either one and I ll tell which you re thinking of  

OK  Well  Watson makes the assumption that muscular activity is equivalent to thinking  But given everything we ve been talking about here  one has to ask  are there alternatives to this motor theory this claim that muscular activities are equivalent to thinking  Is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity  other than saying that it is thinking  And the answer is clearly yes  Is there any way to answer the question definitively  I think the answer is no  

 
TPO2 Lecture 2 Botany
Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture from a Botany class 

Professor
Hi  everyone  Good to see you all today  Actually  I expected the population to be a lot lower today  It typically runs between 50 and 60 percent on the day the research paper is due  Um  I was hoping to have your exams back today  but  uh  the situation was that I went away for the weekend  and I was supposed to get in yesterday at five  and I expected to fully complete all the exams by midnight or so  which is the time that I usually go to bed  but my flight was delayed  and I ended up not getting in until one o clock in the morning  Anyway  I ll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet 
 
OK  In the last class  we started talking about useful plant fibers  In particular  we talked about cotton fibers  which we said were very useful  not only in the textile industry  but also in the chemical industry  and in the production of many products  such as plastics  paper  explosives  and so on  Today we ll continue talking about useful fibers  and we ll begin with a fiber that s commonly known as  Manila hemp   

Now  for some strange reason  many people believe that Manila hemp is a hemp plant  But Manila hemp is not really hemp  It s actually a member of the banana family  it even bears little banana shaped fruits  The  Manila  part of the name makes sense  because Manila hemp is produced chiefly in the Philippine Islands and  of course  the capital city of the Philippines is Manila  

Now  as fibers go  Manila hemp fibers are very long  They can easily be several feet in length and they re also very strong  very flexible  They have one more characteristic that s very important  and that is that they are exceptionally resistant to salt water  And this combination of characteristics long  strong  flexible  resistant to salt water makes Manila hemp a great material for ropes  especially for ropes that are gonna be used on ocean going ships  In fact  by the early 1940 s  even though steel cables were available  most ships in the United States Navy were not moored with steel cables  they were moored with Manila hemp ropes  

Now  why was that  Well  the main reason was that steel cables degrade very  very quickly in contact with salt water  If you ve ever been to San Francisco  you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is red  And it s red because of the zinc paint that goes on those stainless steel cables  That  if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end  by the time they finish  it s already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again  because the bridge was built with steel cables  and steel cables can t take the salt air unless they re treated repeatedly with a zinc based paint  

On the other hand  plant products like Manila hemp  you can drag through the ocean for weeks on end  If you wanna tie your anchor to it and drop it right into the ocean  that s no problem  because plant fibers can stand up for months  even years  in direct contact with salt water  OK  So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could break with your hands and turn them into a rope that s strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons  Well  what you do is you extract these long fibers from the Manila hemp plant  and then you take several of these fibers  and you group them into a bundle  because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength that bundle of fibers is much stronger than any of the individual fibers that compose it  And then you take that bundle of fibers and you twist it a little bit  because by twisting it  you increase its breaking strength even more  And then you take several of these little bundles  and you group and twist them into bigger bundles  which you then group and twist into even bigger bundles  and so on  until eventually  you end up with a very  very strong rope

Where do you work at 

Boy
Buster s coffee shop  but just till the end of the month  What are you doing next semester 

Girl
Actually a teaching seminar too  And I will have to start writing my thesis  You know  I m also going for my master s degree 

Boy
So you are not writing any poetry  I imagine 

Girl
No  I was actually thinking about revising some of my poems and sending them into places for publication 

Boy
Cool  you should  Um  did you hear about that new poetry club  The Poetry Kitchen 

Girl
Yeah  no time 

Boy
It s fun  It s Sunday night  You don t do anything at Sunday nights 

Girl
I do homework Sunday nights 

Boy
Well  it s only from 7 to 9 

Girl
Is it every Sunday 

Boy
Last Sunday of every month  I don t know about this month   cause it s probably a little too close to Thanksgiving  so they might move it up  I don t know what they are gonna to do  but it s a good time  it s fun  some really impressive readings 

Girl
Who  From our class 

Boy
Some people from our class are reading  A lot of them go  sometimes even the professor 

Girl
Really  I don t know if I would want reading in front of her 

Boy
You wouldn t have to read  you can just watch  I just watched the first time  but it s a good environment to read them  I think anyway 

Girl
I probably have to write something new  so maybe during the summer  I just can t now 

Boy
Yeah  it wouldn t be the same just reading old stuff  Are you going to do summer school 

Girl
Definitely  Otherwise  I will be short 6 credits  I have no choice 

Boy
Yeah  me too  This is the second summer I ll have to take classes  I gotta go now  my Shakespeare class starts at twenty minutes 
 
TPO2 Lecture 3 Philosophy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a philosophy class 

Professor
OK  Another ancient Greek philosopher we need to discuss is Aristotle Aristotle s ethical theory  What Aristotle s ethical theory is all about is this  he s trying to show you how to be happy what true happiness is  

Now  why is he interested in human happiness  It s not just because it s something that all people want to aim for  It s more than that  But to get there we need to first make a very important distinction  Let me introduce a couple of technical terms  extrinsic value and intrinsic value  

To understand Aristotle s interest in happiness  you need to understand this distinction  

Some things we aim for and value  not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves  If I value something as a means to something else  then it has what we will call  extrinsic value   Other things we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone  If we value something not as a means to something else  but for its own sake  let us say that it has  intrinsic value   

Exercise  There may be some people who value exercise for itself  but I don t  I value exercise because if I exercise  I tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn t  So I desire to engage in exercise and I value exercise extrinsically       not for its own sake  but as a means to something beyond it  It brings me good health  

Health  Why do I value good health  Well  here it gets a little more complicated for me  Um  health is important for me because I can t      do other things I want to do  play music  teach philosophy if I m ill  So health is important to me has value to me as a means to a productive life  But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be healthy it feels good  It s pleasant to be healthy  unpleasant not to be  So to some degree I value health both for itself and as a means to something else  productivity  It s got extrinsic and intrinsic value for me  

Then there s some things that are just valued for themselves  I m a musician  not a professional musician  I just play a musical instrument for fun  Why do I value playing music  Well  like most amateur musicians  I only play because  well  I just enjoy it  It s something that s an end in itself  

Now  something else I value is teaching  Why  Well  it brings in a modest income  but I could make more money doing other things  I d do it even if they didn t pay me  I just enjoy teaching  In that sense it s an end to itself  

But teaching s not something that has intrinsic value for all people and that s true generally  Most things that are enjoyed in and of themselves vary from person to person  Some people value teaching intrinsically  but others don t  

So how does all this relate to human happiness  Well  Aristotle asks  is there something that all human beings value       and value only intrinsically  for its own sake and only for its own sake  If you could find such a thing  that would be the universal final good  or truly the ultimate purpose or goal for all human beings  Aristotle thought the answer was yes  What is it  Happiness  Everyone will agree  he argues  that happiness is the ultimate end to be valued for itself and really only for itself  For what other purpose is there in being happy  What does it yield  The attainment of happiness becomes the ultimate or highest good for Aristotle  

The next question that Aristotle raises is  what is happiness  We all want it  we all desire it  we all seek it  It s the goal we have in life  But what is it  How do we find it  Here he notes  with some frustration  people disagree  

But he does give us a couple of criteria  or features  to keep in mind as we look for what true human happiness is  True human happiness should be  as he puts it  complete  Complete in that it s all we require  Well  true human happiness       if you had that  what else do you need  Nothing  

And  second  true happiness should be something that I can obtain on my own  I shouldn t have to rely on other people for it  Many people value fame and seek fame  Fame for them becomes the goal  But  according to Aristotle  this won t work either  because fame depends altogether too much on other people  I can t get it on my own  without help from other people  

In the end  Aristotle says that true happiness is the exercise of reason a life of intellectual contemplation       of thinking  So let s see how he comes to that 
TPO 2 Lecture 4 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class  You will not need to remember the numbers the professor mentions 

Professor
OK  Let s get going  Today I m going to talk about how the asteroid belt was discovered  And       I m going to start by writing some numbers on the board  Here they are  We ll start with zero  then 3        6        12  Uh  tell me what I m doing 

Female student
Multiplying by 2 

Professor
Right  I m doubling the numbers  so 2 times 12 is 24  and the next one I m going to write after 24 would be      

Female student
48 

Professor
48  Then 96  We ll stop there for now  Uh  now I ll write another row of numbers under that  Tell me what I m doing  4  7  10       How am I getting this second row 

Male Student
Adding 4 to the numbers in the first row 

Professor
I m adding 4 to each number in the first row to give you a second row  So the last two will be 52  100  and now tell me what I m doing 

Female Student
Putting in a decimal 

Professor
Yes  I divided all those numbers by 10 by putting in a decimal point  Now I m going to write the names of the planets under the numbers  Mercury       Venus      Earth      Mars  So  what do the numbers mean  Do you remember from the reading 

Male Student
Is it the distance of the planets from the Sun 

Professor
Right  In astronomical units not perfect  but tantalizingly close  The value for Mars is off by       6 or 7 percent or so  It s       but it s within 10 percent of the average distance to Mars from the Sun  But I kind of have to skip the one after Mars for now  Then Jupiter s right there at 5 point something  and then Saturn is about 10 astronomical units from the Sun  Um  well  this pattern is known as Bode s Law  

Um  it isn t really a scientific law  not in the sense of predicting gravitation mathematically or something  but it s attempting a pattern in the spacing of the planets  and it was noticed by Bode hundreds of years ago  Well  you can imagine that there was some interest in why the 2 8 spot in the pattern was skipped  and um       but there wasn t anything obvious there  in the early telescopes  Then what happened in the late 1700s  The discovery of         

Female Student
Another planet 

Professor
The next planet out  Uranus after Saturn  

And look  Uranus fits in the next spot in the pattern pretty nicely  um  not perfectly  but close  And so then people got really excited about the validity of this thing and finding the missing object between Mars and Jupiter  And telescopes  remember  were getting better  So people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the Sun  and then in 1801  the object Ceres was discovered  

And Ceres was in the right place the missing spot  Uh  but it was way too faint to be a planet  It looked like a little star  Uh  and because of its starlike appearance  um  it was called an  asteroid   OK   Aster  is Greek for  star   as in  astronomy   Um  and so  Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance  Not just one thing  but all the objects found at that distance from the asteroid belt  So the asteroid belt is the most famous success of this Bode s Law  That s how the asteroid belt was discovered

Student
Excuse me  I m supposed to be having my physics class in the science building  but no one s in the classroom  Could you tell me where the class is  Physics 403   has it been moved 

Receptionist
Well  there s a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office 

Student
Yeah  I know  but my class isn t listed there  There must be some kind of mistake or something  Could you look it up  please 

Receptionist
Hmmm    ok  let me check on the computer  It s physics  right  Wait  did you say physics 403 

Student
Yeah  

Receptionist 
Er…I m sorry  but it says here that it was cancelled  You should have gotten a letter from the registrar s office about this 

Student
What  I ve never got it 

Receptionist
Are you sure   Cause it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago 

Student
Really  I should have gotten it by now  I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake 

Receptionist
Well  it does happen  Er… let me check something  What s your name 

Student
Woodhouse  Laura Woodhouse 

Receptionist
Ok  hmmm…Woodhouse  let me see… ah  it says here we sent it to your apartment on er… Center Street 

Student
Oh  that s my old apartment  I moved out of there a little while ago 

Receptionist
Well  and I suppose you haven t changed your mailing address at the administration office  Well  that would explain it 

Student
Yeah  I guess that s it  But how can they cancel the class after offering it  If I d known this was going to happen  I would have taken it last semester 

Receptionist
I know  it s really inconvenient for you  I understand that  but er… if we don t have enough students signed up for the course  the college can t offer it  You know  it s a practical issue  like we can t have an instructor when there re only a few students in the class  You see what I mean 

Student
I guess  but now I don t know what course I should take instead 

Receptionist
Ok  let s see  Do you have any courses you re going to take next semester  If you do  you might want to take them now and sign up for physics 403 next semester 

Student
Yeah  I guess I could do that  I just hope it won t be cancelled again  Do you know how many people have to be enrolled in order to keep a class from being cancelled 

Receptionist
Well  it depends on the class  but for that class  you have to have er… let s see  usually it d be at least ten people  but since it was cancelled this semester  they might even do it with less  But do you know what you should do  Give the physics department a call a couple of weeks before the semester starts  They ll be able to tell you if they re planning to go through with it  It s their decision  actually 

Student
Oh  ok  I will do that  Thanks for the info 

Receptionist
No problem  Sorry about the class  Oh  why don t you go change your mailing address now  It ll only takes a minute 

Student
Oh  oh  sure  I will do that right way 

 
TPO 3 Lecture 1 Environmental science

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class 

Professor
Now  we ve been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments  um…  growing cities – small habitat losses  But today I wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area  There are  of course  animal species that require large areas of habitat  and some migrate over very long distances  So what s the impact of habitat loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat  

Well  I ll use the humming birds as an example  

Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small  but even though it s really tiny  it migrates over very long distances  travels up and down the western hemisphere – the Americas  back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter  So we would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its habitat because on this long distance journey  it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often  right  

Well  the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per minute  So you think  wow  it must need a lot of energy  a lot of food  right  Well  it does  It drinks a lot of nectar from flowers and feeds on some insects  but it s energy efficient too  You can t say it isn t  I mean  as it flies all the way across the Gulf of Mexico  it uses up almost none of its body fat  But that doesn t mean it doesn t need to eat  So humming birds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat  

And it goes without saying  but  well  the opposite is true as well  plants depend on humming birds too  There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds  Without it stopping to feed and spreading pollen from flower to flower  these plants would cease to exist  

But the problem  well  as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or agriculture or cleared for raising cattle  for instance  there is less food available for migrating humming birds  Their nesting sites are affected too  the same  by the same sorts of human activities  And all of these activities pose a real threat to the humming bird population  

So to help them survive  we need to preserve their habitats  And one of the concrete ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers  um  replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on  

Promoting ecological tourism is another way to help save their habitat  As the number of visitors  eco tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds  the more the number of visitors grows  the more local businesses profit  so ecological tourism can bring financial rewards  all the more reason to value these beautiful little creatures in their habitat  right  

But to understand more about how to protect and support humming birds the best we can  we ve got to learn more about their breeding  nesting sites and migration routes  and also about the natural habitats we find there  That should help us determine how to prevent further decline in the population  

A good research method  a good way to learn more  is by running a banding study  Banding the birds allows us to track them over their lifetime  It s been a practice that s been used by researchers for years  In fact  most of what we know about humming birds comes from banding studies  where we capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it  like its weight and age and length  are all recorded  put into international  an international information database  And then we place an extremely lightweight band on one of its legs  well  what looks like a leg  although technically it s considered part of the bird s foot  

Anyway  these bands are perfectly safe  and some humming birds have worn them for years with no evidence of any problems  The band is labeled with a tracking number  oh  and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for free  to report a banded bird they ve found or recaptured  So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported  we learn about its migration route  its growth  and how long it has been alive  its lifespan  One recaptured bird had been banded almost 12 years earlier – she is one of the oldest humming birds on record  

Another interesting thing we ve learned is that some humming birds  um  they no longer use a certain route  They travel by a different route to reach their destination  And findings like these have been of interest to biologists and environmental scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a habitat affect the species in it  

 
TPO 3 Lecture 2 Film history
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a film history class 

Professor
Okay  we ve been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s  and how back then film categories  as we know them today  had not yet been established  We said that by today s standards  many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids  that is  a mixture of styles that wouldn t exactly fit into any of today s categories  And in that context  today we are going to talk about a film maker who began making very unique films in the late 1920s  He was French  and his name was Jean Painlevé  

Jean Painlevé was born in 1902  He made his first film in 1928  Now in a way  Painlevé s films conform to norms of the 20s and 30s  that is  they don t fit very neatly into the categories we use to classify films today  That said  even by the standards of the 20s and 30s  Painlevé s films were a unique hybrid of styles  He had a special way of fusing  or some people might say  confusing  science and fiction  His films begin with facts  but then they become more and more fictional  They gradually add more and more fictional elements  In fact  Painlevé was known for saying that science is fiction  

Painlevé was a pioneer in underwater film making  and a lot of his short films focused on the aquatic animal world  He liked to show small underwater creatures  displaying what seemed like familiar human characteristics – what we think of as unique to humans  He might take a clip of a mollusk going up and down in the water and set it to music  You know  to make it look as if the mollusk were dancing to the music like a human being – that sort of thing  But then he suddenly changed the image or narration to remind us how different the animals are  how unlike humans  

He confused his audience in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed  mixing up our notions of the categories human and animal  The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing  It gives him films an uncanny feature  the familiar made unfamiliar  the normal made suspicious  He liked twists  he liked the unusual  In fact  one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses  it s the male that carries the eggs  and he thought that was great  His first and most celebrated underwater film is about the seahorse  

Susan  you have a question 

Student 1
But underwater film making wasn t that unusual  was it  I mean  weren t there other people making movies underwater 

Professor
Well  actually  it was pretty rare at that time  I mean  we are talking the early 1930s here 

Student 1
But what about Jacques Cousteau  Was he like an innovator  you know  with underwater photography too 

Professor
Ah  Jacques Cousteau  Well  Painlevé and Cousteau did both film underwater  and they were both innovators  so you are right in that sense  But that s pretty much where the similarities end  

First of all  Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau  And Cousteau s adventures were high tech  with lots of fancy equipment  whereas Painlevé kind of patchedequipment together as he needed it  Cousteau usually filmed large animals  usually in the open sea  whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals  and he liked to film in shallow water  

Uh  what else  Oh well  the main difference was that Cousteau simply investigated and presented the facts – he didn t mix in fiction  He was a strict documentarist  He set the standard really for the nature documentary  Painlevé  on the other hand  as we said before  mixed in elements of fiction  And his films are much more artistic  incorporating music as an important element  

John  you have a question 

Student 2
Well  maybe I shouldn t be asking this  but if Painlevé s films are so special  so good  why haven t we ever heard of them  I mean  everyone s heard of Jacques Cousteau 

Professor
Well  that s a fair question  Uh  the short answer is that Painlevé s style just never caught on with the general public  I mean  it probably goes back at least in part to what we mentioned earlier  that people didn t know what to make of his films – they were confused by them  whereas Cousteau s documentaries were very straightforward  met people s expectations more than Painlevé s films did  But you true film history buffs know about him  And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles

Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor 

Student
Hi  Professor Archer  you know how in class last week you said that you were looking for students who are interested in volunteering for your archeology project 

Professor
Of course  are you volunteering 

Student
Yes  I am  It sounds really interesting  but um… do I need to have any experience for these kinds of projects 

Professor
No  not really  I assume that most students taking the introductory level class would have little or no experience with archeological research  but that s ok 

Student
Oh  good  that s a relief  Actually  that s why I m volunteering for the project   to get experience  What kind of work is it 

Professor
Well  as you know  we re studying the history of the campus this semester  This used to be an agricultural area and we already know that where the main lecture hall now stands  there once were farm house and barn that were erected in the late 1700s  We are excavating near the lecture hall to see what types of artifacts we find  you know  things people used in the past that got buried when the campus was constructed  We ve already begun to find some very interesting items  like old bottles  buttons  pieces of clay pottery 

Student
Buttons and clay pottery  Did the old owners leave in such a hurry that they left their clothes and dishes behind 

Professor
Hmmm… that s just one of the questions we hope to answer with this project 

Student
Wow  and it s all right here on campus 

Professor
That s right  no traveling involved  I wouldn t expect volunteers to travel to a site  especially in the middle of the semester  We expect to find many more things  but we do need more people to help 

Student
So… how many student volunteers are you looking for 

Professor
I m hoping to get five or six  I ve asked for volunteers in all of the classes I teach  but no one has responded  You are the first person to express interest 

Student
Sounds like it could be a lot of work  Is there um… is there any way I can use the experience to get some extra credit in class  I mean  can I write a paper about it 

Professor
I think it ll depend on what type of work you do in the excavation  but I imagine we can arrange something  Actually I ve been considering offering extra credit for class because I ve been having a tough time getting volunteers  Extra credit is always a good incentive for students 

Student
And how often would you want the volunteers to work 

Professor
We re asking for three or four hours per week  depending on your schedule  A senior researcher  I think you know John Franklin  my assistant  is on site every day 

Student
Sure  I know John  By the way  will there be some sort of training 

Professor
Yes  er… I want to wait till Friday to see how many students volunteer  and then I ll schedule a training class next week at a time that s convenient for everyone 

Student
Ok  I ll wait to hear from you  Thanks a lot for accepting me 

 
TPO 3 Lecture 3 Art History
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class  The professor has been discussing the origins of art 

Professor
Some of the world s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe  most of it in Spain and France  And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994  

And you know  I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings  I said to my wife   Can you believe these paintings are over 30 000 years old   And my 3 year old daughter piped up and said   Is that older than my great grandmother   That was the oldest age she knew  And you know  come to think of it  It s pretty hard for me to really understand how long 30 000 years is too  I mean  we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty primitive  But I m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art is anything but primitive  They are masterpieces  And they look so real  so alive that it s very hard to imagine that they are so very old  

Now  not everyone agrees on exactly how old  A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30 000 or more years ago  That would make them not just older than any other cave art  but about twice as old as the art in the caves at Altamira or Lascaux  which you may have heard of  Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux  and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet  without independent confirmation from any other lab  But be that as it may  whatever the exact date  whether it s 15 000  20 000 or 30 000 years ago  the Chauvet paintings are from the dawn of art  So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting  

Now  one thing you ve got to remember is the context of these paintings  Paleolithic humans   that s the period we are talking about here  the Paleolithic  the early stone age  not too long after humans first arrived in Europe   the climate was significantly colder then  and so rock shelters  shallow caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain  And in some cases at least  artists drew on the walls of their homes  

But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited  These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave  where no natural light can penetrate  There s no evidence of people ever living here  Cave bears  yes  but not humans  You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings  and a special trip to go see it  And each time you d have to bring along torches to light your way  And people did go see the art  There s charcoal marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made  So we can tell people went there  They came but they didn t stay  Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you d want to stay  so  why  What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places  We ll never really know of course  though it s interesting to speculate  

But  um  getting to the paintings themselves  virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals  and Chauvet is no exception  The artists were highly skilled at using  or even enhancing  the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings  the sense of motion and vitality in these animals  Well  wait till I show you the slides  Anyway  most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores  Horses are most common overall with deer and bison pretty common too  probably animals they hunted  

But earlier at Chauvet  there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals  lots of rhinoceros  lions  mammoth  bears  Remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then  so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time  

But the Chauvet artists didn t paint people  There is a half man half bison creature and there is outlines of human hands but no depiction of a full human  

So  why these precise animals  Why not birds  fish  snakes  Was it for their religion  magic or sheer beauty  We don t know  But whatever it was  it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness  So  on that note  let s dim the lights  so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used  

 
TPO 3 Lecture 4 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 

Professor
Now astronomy didn t really bloom into the science it is today until the development of spectroscopy  

Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light  and specifically for us  the light from stars  It makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars  When you analyze this light  you can figure out their distance from the Earth  and identify what they are made of  determine their chemical composition  

Before we get into that though  it s probably a good thing to back up a bit  You all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it  you get a spectrum  which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors  The light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color falls in the range of what s called visible light  And visible light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy  

Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light  And I m sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today 

Student
Optical radiation  But I thought being exposed to radiation is dangerous 

Professor
Yes  and no  If you are talking about radiation  like in the element Uranium  yeah  that s dangerous  But radiation as a general term actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source  So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out  

OK  so we ve got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other  There are no interruptions  just a band flowing from violet to green  to yellow  to… you get the idea  

Well  what happens if the sunlight s spectrum is magnified  Maybe you all didn t do the reading  Well  here s what you d see  I want you to notice that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines  If you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight  you could identify more than 100 000 of them  They may look like kind of randomly placed  but they actually form many distinct patterns  And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star  the colors would be the same  But the spectral lines would break it up at different places  making different patterns  Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element  and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition 

Student
So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements 

Professor
Well  a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests  A known element  say a piece of iron for example  is heated in a pure gas flame  The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light  This light is passed through a prism  which breaks it up into a spectrum  And a unique pattern  kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that element appears  This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements  so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has to the pattern of the elements in the library  

Oh  an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy  There was a pretty extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s  A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight  and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn t match anything in the library  So he put two and two together  and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn t been discovered here on the earth yet  

Any guesses about what that element is  It actually turned out to be pretty common and I m sure all of you know it  
OK  Let s try something else  Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for  sun  by chance 

Student
Something like  Helius  or something like that  Oh  it must be  Helium   So you are saying that Helium was discovered on the sun first 

Professor
Yes  and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in astronomy

It s Happy Strangers  It was written in 1962 and we are supposed to write about its influence on American theatre and show why it s been so important 

Librarian
Well  that certainly explains why your professor wants you to read some of those old reviews  The critiques really tore the play to pieces when it opened  It s so controversial  Nobody had ever seen anything like it on the stage 

Student
Really  Is that a big deal 

Librarian
Oh  sure  Of course the critics  reaction made some people kind of curious about it  They wanted to see what was causing all the fuss  In fact  we were on vacation in New York  Oh  I had to be  oh  around 16 or so  and my parents took me to see it  That would ve been about 1965 

Student
So that was the year it premiered  Great  But uh  newspapers from back then aren t online  so  how do I…

Librarian
Well  we have copies of old newspapers in the basement  and all the major papers publish reference guides to their articles  reviews  etc  You will find them in the reference stacks in the back  But I start with 1964  I think the play had been running for a little while when I saw it 

Student
How do you like it  I mean just two characters on the stage hanging around basically doing nothing 

Librarian
Well  I was impressed  The actors were famous  and besides it was my first time in a real theatre  But you are right  It was definitely different from many plays that we read in high school  Of course  in a small town the assignments are pretty traditional 

Student
Yeah  I ve only read it but it doesn t seem like it would be much fun to watch  The story doesn t progress in any sort of logical matter  doesn t have real ending either  just stops  Honestly  you know  I thought it was kind of slow and boring 

Librarian
Oh  well I guess you might think that  But when I saw it back then it was anything but boring  Some parts were really funny  but I remember crying too  But I m not sure just reading it  You know  they ve done this play at least once on campus  I m sure there is a tape of the play in our video library  You might want to borrow it 

Student
That s a good idea  I ll have a better idea of what I really think of it before I read those reviews 

Librarian
I m sure you will be surprised that anyone ever found it radical  But you will see why it is still powerful  dramatically speaking 

Student
Well  there must be something about it  or the professor wouldn t have assigned it  I m sure I ll figure it out 

 
TPO 4 Lecture 1 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class  The class is discussing animal behavior 

Professor
Ok  the next kind of animal behavior I want to talk about might be familiar to you  You may have seen  for example  a bird that s in the middle of a mating ritual  and suddenly it stops and preens  you know  it takes a few moments to straighten its feathers  and then returns to the mating ritual  This kind of behavior  this doing something that seems completely out of place  is what we call a  Displacement Activity   

Displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives  If we take our example from a minute ago  if the bird is afraid of its mate  it s conflicted  It wants to mate but it s also afraid and wants to run away  So  instead  it starts grooming itself  So  the displacement activity  the grooming  the straightening of its feathers  seems to be an irrelevant behavior  

So  what do you think another example of a displacement activity might be 

Karl
How about an animal that  um  instead of fighting its enemy or running away  it attacks a plant or a bush 

Professor
That s really good suggestion  Karl  But that s called  redirecting   The animal is redirecting its behavior to another object  in this case  the plant or the bush  But that s not an irrelevant or inappropriate behavior  The behavior makes sense  It s appropriate under the circumstances  But what doesn t make sense is the object the behavior s directed towards  

Ok  who else  Carol 

Carol
I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food – next to the animal s food  And the animal  it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food  so instead  it just fell asleep  Like that 

Professor
That s exactly what I mean  Displacement occurs because the animal s got two conflicting drives – two competing urges  in this case  fear and hunger  And what happens is  they inhibit each other  they cancel each other out in a way  and a third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call  Disinhibition   

Now  in disinhibition  the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit  to hold back  a third drive  Well  well  they re getting in a way of each other in a… in a conflict situation and somehow lose control  lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior  which means that the third drive surfaces  it s expressed in the animal s behavior  

Now  these displacement activities can include feeding  drinking  grooming  even sleeping  These are what we call  Comfort Behavior   So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors  such as grooming 

Karl
Maybe because it s easy for them to do  I mean  grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do  It s something they do all the time  and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming  or if food is right in front of them  Basically  they don t have to think very much about those behaviors 

Carol
Professor  isn t it possible that animals groom because they ve got messed up a little from fighting or mating  I mean if a bird s feathers get ruffled or an animal s fur  maybe it s not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point 

Professor
That s another possible reason although it doesn t necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating  drinking or sleeping  

What s interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal s environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays  For example  there s a bird  the  wood thrush   anyway  when the  wood thrush  is in an attack escape conflict  that is  it s caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy  if it s sitting on a horizontal branch  it ll wipe its beak on its perch  If it s sitting on a vertical branch  it ll groom its breast feathers  The immediate environment of the bird  its immediate  um  its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior will display 

 
TPO 4 Lecture 2 Literature
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class 

Professor
All right  so let me close today s class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight s assignment  You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson s best known essays  Self Reliance  and comparing it with his poems and other works  

I think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about things like truth and where your lives are going   all sorts of profound questions  

Knowing something about Emerson s philosophies will help you when you read  Self Reliance   And basically  one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth  Not that it s something that we can be taught  Emerson says it s found within ourselves  So this truth  the idea that it s in each one of us  is one of the first points that you ll see Emerson making in this essay  It s a bit abstract but he s very into…uh… into each person believing his or her own thought  believing in yourself  the thought or conviction that s true for you  

But actually  he ties that in with a sort of  universal truth  – something that everyone knows but doesn t realize they know  Most of us are in touch with ourselves in a way  so we just aren t capable of recognizing profound truth  It takes geniuses  people like  say  Shakespeare  who re unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth  this universal truth  they pay attention to it and express it and don t just dismiss it like most people do  

So Emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself  You ll see that he writes about  well  first  conformity  He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of conformity and consistency  They try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it s at odds with their beliefs and their identities  Therefore  it s best to be a non conformist – to do your own thing  not worrying about what other people think  That s an important point  He really drives this argument home throughout the essay  

When you are reading  I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of his time  Remember this is 1838  Self Reliance  was a novel idea at the time and the United States citizens were less secure about themselves as individuals and as Americans  The country as a whole was trying to define itself  Emerson wanted to give people something to really think about  help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were  So that s something that I think is definitely as relevant today as it was then  probably  um  especially among young adults like yourselves  you know  uh  college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you re going  

Now  we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non conformity  right  As a way to sort of not lose your own self and identity in the world  to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it  

Well  he takes this a step further  Not conforming also means  uh  not conforming with yourself or your past  What does that mean  Well  if you ve always been a certain way or done a certain thing  but it s not working for you any more  or you re not content  Emerson says that it d be foolish to be consistent even with our own past  Focus on the future   he says   That s what matters more  Inconsistency is good   

He talks about a ship s voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay   how the best voyage is made up of zigzag lines  Up close  it seems a little all over the place  but from farther away  the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way  So  don t worry if you are not sure where you re headed or what your long term goals are  Stay true to yourself and it ll make sense in the end  I mean  I can attest to that  Before I was a literature professor  I was an accountant  Before that  I was a newspaper reporter  My life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here I am  very happy with my experiences and where they ve brought me  If you rely on yourself and trust your own talents  your own interest  don t worry  your path will make sense in the end

Professor
Hey  Jane  you look like you are in a hurry 

Student
Yeah  things are a little crazy 

Professor
Oh yeah  What s going on 

Student
Oh  it s nothing  Well  since it s your class  I guess it s OK  It s  it s just that I am having trouble with my group project 

Professor
Ah  yes  due next week  What s your group doing again 

Student
It s about United States Supreme Court Decisions  We are looking at the impact of recent cases on property rights  municipal land use cases  owning disputes 

Professor
Right  OK  And it s not going well 

Student
Not really  I m worried about the other two people in my group  They are just sitting back  not really doing their fair share of the work and waiting for an A  It s kind of stressing me out  because we are getting close to the deadline and I feel like I m doing everything for this project 

Professor
Ah  the good old free rider problem 

Student
Free rider 

Professor
Ah  it s just a term that describes this situation  when people in the group seek to get the benefits of being in a group without contributing to the work  Anyway  what exactly do you mean when you say they just sit back  I mean  they ve been filing the weekly progress reports with me 

Student
Yes  but I feel like I m doing 90% of the work  I hate to sound so negative here  but honestly  they are taking credit for things they shouldn t take credit for  Like last week in the library  we decided to split up the research into 3 parts and then each of us was supposed to find sources in the library for our parts  I went off to the stack and found some really good material for my part  but when I got back to our table  they were just goofing off and talking  So I went and got materials for their sections as well  

Professor
Um…you know you shouldn t do that 

Student
I know  but I didn t want to risk the project going down the drain 

Professor
I know Teresa and Kevin  I had both of them in other courses  So  I m familiar with the work and work habits 

Student
I know  me too  And that s why this has really surprised me 

Professor
Do you…does your group like your topic 

Student
Well  I think we d all rather focus on cases that deal with personal liberties  questions about freedom of speech  things like that  But I chose property rights 

Professor
You chose the topic 

Student
Yeah  I thought it would be good for us  all of us to try something new 

Professor
Um…maybe that s part of the problem  Maybe Teresa and Kevin aren t that excited about the topic  And since you picked it  have you thought…talk to them at all about picking a different topic 

Student
But we ve got all the sources and it s due next week  We don t have time to start from scratch 

Professor
OK  I will let you go  cause I know you are so busy  But you might consider talking to your group about your topic choice 

Student
I will think about it  Got to run  see you in class 


 
TPO 4 Lecture 3 Geology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class 

Professor
Now we ve got a few minutes before we leave for today  So I ll just touch on an interesting subject that I think makes an important point  

We ve been covering rocks and different types of rocks for the last several weeks  But next week we are going to do something a bit different  And to get started I thought I d mention something that shows how uh…as a geologist  you need to know about more than just rocks and the structure of solid matter 

Moving rocks  you may have heard about them  It s quite a mystery  Death valley is this desert plain  a dry lake bed in California surrounded by mountains and on the desert floor these huge rocks  some of them hundreds of pounds  And they move  They leave long trails behind them  tracks you might say as they move from one point to another  But nobody has been able to figure out how they are moving because no one has ever seen it happen  

Now there are a lot of theories  but all we know for sure is that people aren t  moving the rocks  There are no footprints  no type tracks and no heavy machinery like a bulldozer…uh  nothing was ever brought in to move these heavy rocks  

So what s going on  Theory NO 1    Wind  Some researchers think powerful uh…windstorms might move the rocks  Most of the rocks move in the same direction as the dominant wind pattern from southwest to northeast  But some  and this is interesting  move straight west while some zigzag or even move in large circles  Hmm…How can that be  

How about wind combined with rain  The ground of this desert is made of clay  It s a desert  so it s dry  But when there is the occasional rain  the clay ground becomes extremely slippery  It s hard for anyone to stand on  walk on  Some scientists theorized that perhaps when the ground is slippery the high winds can then move the rocks  There s a problem with this theory  One team of scientists flooded an area of the desert with water  then try to establish how much wind force would be necessary to move the rocks  And get this  you need winds of at least five hundred miles an hour to move just the smallest rocks  And winds that strong have never been recorded  Ever  Not on this planet  So I think it s safe to say that that issues has been settled  

Here is another possibility – ice  It s possible that rain on the desert floor could turn to thin sheets of ice when temperatures drop at night  So if rocks…uh become embedded in ice  uh … OK  could a piece of ice with rocks in it be pushed around by the wind  But there s a problem with this theory  too  Rocks trapped in ice together would have moved together when the ice moved  But that doesn t always happen  The rocks seem to take separate routes  

There are a few other theories  Maybe the ground vibrates  or maybe the ground itself is shifting  tilting  Maybe the rocks are moved by a magnetic force  But sadly all these ideas have been eliminated as possibilities  There s just no evidence  I bet you are saying to yourself well  why don t scientists just set up video cameras to record what actually happens  Thing is  this is a protected wilderness area  So by law that type of research isn t allowed  Besides  in powerful windstorms  sensitive camera equipment would be destroyed  So why can t researchers just live there for a while until they observe the rocks moving  Same reason  

So where are we now  Well  right now we still don t have any answers  So all this leads back to my main point – you need to know about more than just rocks as geologists  The researchers studying moving rocks  well  they combine their knowledge of rocks with knowledge of wind  ice and such…uh not successfully  not yet  But you know  they wouldn t even have been able to get started without um… earth science understanding – knowledge about wind  storms  you know  meteorology  You need to understand physics  So for several weeks like I said we ll be addressing geology from a wider perspective  I guess that s all for today  See you next time  

 
TPO 4 Lecture 4 United States government

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a United States government class 

Professor
OK  last time we were talking about government support for the arts  Who can sum up some of the main points  Frank 

Frank
Well  I guess there wasn t really any  you know  official government support for the arts until the twentieth century  But the first attempt the United States government made to  you know  to support the arts was the Federal Art Project 

Professor
Right  so what can you say about the project 

Frank
Um…it was started during the Depression  um…in the 1930s to employ out of work artists 

Professor
So was it successful  Janet  What do you say 

Janet
Yeah  sure  it was successful  I mean  for one thing  the project established a lot of…uh like community art centers and galleries in places like rural areas where people hadn t really had access to the arts 

Professor
Right 

Frank
Yeah  But didn t the government end up wasting a lot of money for art that wasn t even very good 

Professor
Uh…some people might say that  But wasn t the primary objective of the Federal Art Project to provide jobs 

Frank
That s true  I mean…it did provide jobs for thousands of unemployed artists 

Professor
Right  But then when the United States became involved in the Second World War  unemployment was down and it seems that these programs weren t really necessary any longer  

So  moving on  we don t actually see any govern…well any real government involvement in the arts again until the early 1960s  when President Kennedy and other politicians started to push for major funding to support and promote the arts  It was felt by a number of politicians that …well that the government had a responsibility to support the arts as sort of… oh  what can we say    the the soul…or spirit of the country  The idea was that there be a federal subsidy…um…uh…financial assistance to artists and artistic or cultural institutions  And for just those reasons  in 1965  the National Endowment for the Arts was created  So it was through the NEA  the National Endowment for the Arts  um…that the arts would develop  would be promoted throughout the nation  

And then individual states throughout the country started to establish their own state arts councils to help support the arts  There was kind of uh…cultural explosion  And by the mid 1970s  by 1974 I think  all fifty states had their own arts agencies  their own state arts councils that work with the federal government with corporations  artists  performers  you name it 

Frank
Did you just say corporations  How are they involved 

Professor
Well  you see  corporations aren t always altruistic  They might not support the arts unless…well  unless the government made it attractive for them to do so  by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts  that is  by letting corporations pay less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts  Um  the Kennedy Centre in Washington D C    you may uh…maybe you ve been there  or Lincoln Centre in New York  Both of these were built with substantial financial support from corporations  And the Kennedy and Lincoln center s aren t the only examples  Many of your cultural establishments in the United States will have a plaque somewhere acknowledging the support – the money they received from whatever corporation  Oh  yes  Janet 

Janet
But aren t there a lot of people who don t think it s the government s role to support the arts 

Professor
Well  as a matter of fact  a lot of politicians who did not believe in government support for the arts  they wanted to do away with the agency entirely  for that very reason  to get rid of governmental support  But they only succeeded in taking away about half the annual budget  And as far as the public goes  well…there are about as many individuals who disagree with the government support as there are those who agree  

In fact  with artists in particular  you have lots of artists who support and who have benefited from this agency  although it seems that just as many artists oppose the government agency being involved in the arts  for many different reasons  reasons like they don t want the government to control what they create  In other words  the arguments both for and against government funding of the arts are as many and  and as varied as the individual styles of the artists who hold them

Student
Hi  thanks for seeing me on such short notice 

Counselor
No problem  How can I help 

Student
Well  I think I might have made a mistake coming to the school 

Counselor
What makes you say that 

Student
I m a little overwhelmed by the size of this place  I come from a small town  There were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class  Everyone knew everyone  We all grew up together 

Counselor
So it s a bit of a culture shock for you  Being one of 15 000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city 

Student
That s an understatement  I just can t get comfortable in class or in the dorms  You know  socially 

Counselor
Hmmm…well  let s start with your academics  Tell me about your classes 

Student
I m taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls 

Counselor
And you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material 

Student
No  in fact I got an A on my first economics paper  It s just that  it s so impersonal  I m not used to it 

Counselor
Are all your classes impersonal 

Student
No  it s just that…for example  in sociology yesterday  the professor asked a question  so I raised my hand  several of us raised our hands  And I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer  But the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture 

Counselor
Well  in a big room it s possible he didn t notice you  Maybe he was trying to save time  In either case I wouldn t take it personally 

Student
I suppose  But I just don t know how to  you know  distinguish myself 

Counselor
Why not stop by his office during office hours 

Student
That wouldn t seem right  You know  taking time from other students who need help 

Counselor
Don t say that  That s what office hours are for  There is no reason you couldn t pop in to say hi and to make yourself known  If you are learning a lot in class  let the professor know  Wouldn t you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor 

Student
You are right  That s a good idea 

Counselor
OK  er…let s turn to your social life  How s it going in the dorms 

Student
I don t have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I ve met so far  Everyone s into sports and I m more artsy  you know  into music  I play the cello 

Counselor
Hah  have you been playing long 

Student
Since age ten  It s a big part of my life  At home I was the youngest member of our community orchestra 

Counselor
You are not going to believe this  There is a string quartet on campus  all students  And it so happened that the cellist graduated last year  They ve been searching high and low for a replacement  someone with experience  Would you be interested in auditioning 

Student
Absolutely  I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here  But I think this would be a good thing for me  I guess if I really want to fit in here I should find people who love music as much as I do  Thank you 

Counselor
My pleasure 

 
TPO 5 Lecture 1 Sociology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a sociology class 

Professor 
Have you ever heard the one about alligators living in New York sewers  The story goes like this  a family went on vacation in Florida and bought a couple of baby alligators as presents for their children  then returned from vacation to New York  bringing the alligators home with them as pets  But the alligators would escape and find their way into the New York sewer system where they started reproducing  grew to huge sizes and now strike fear into sewer workers  Have you heard this story  Well  it isn t true and it never happened  But despite that  the story has been around since the 1930s  

Or how about the song  twinkle  twinkle little star   you know   twinkle  twinkle  little star  how I wonder what you are   Well we ve all heard this song  Where am I going with this  Well  both the song and the story are examples of memes  And that s what we would talk about  the theory of memes  

A meme is defined as a piece of information copied from person to person  By this definition  most of what you know  ideas  skills  stories  songs are memes  All the words you know  all the scientific theories you ve learned  the rules your parents taught you to observe  all are memes that have been passed on from person to person  

So what  You may say  Passing on ideas from one person to another is nothing new  Well  the whole point of defining this familiar process as transmission of memes is so that we can explore its analogy with the transmission of genes  As you know  all living organisms pass on biological information through the genes  What s a gene  A gene is a piece of biological information that gets copied or replicated  and the copy or replica is passed on to the new generation  So genes are defined as replicators  Genes are replicators that pass on information about properties and characteristics of organisms  By analogy  memes also get replicated and in the process pass on cultural information from person to person  generation to generation  So memes are also replicators  

To be a successful replicator  there are three key characteristics  longevity  fecundity and fidelity  Let s take a closer look  

First  longevity  A replicator must exist long enough to be able to get copied  and transfer its information  Clearly  the longer a replicator survives  the better its chances of getting its message copied and passed on  So longevity is a key characteristic of a replicator  If you take the alligator story  it can exist for a long time in individual memory  let s say  my memory  I can tell you the story now or ten years from now  the same with the twinkle  twinkle song  So these memes have longevity because they are memorable for one reason or another  

Next  fecundity  Fecundity is the ability to reproduce in large numbers  For example  the common housefly reproduces by laying several thousand eggs  so each fly gene gets copied thousands of times  Memes  well  they can be reproduced in large numbers as well  How many times have you sung the twinkle  twinkle song  to someone  Each time you replicated that song  and maybe passed it along to someone who did not know it yet  a small child maybe  

And finally  fidelity  Fidelity means accuracy of the copying process  We know fidelity is an essential principle of genetic transmission  If a copy of a gene is a bit different from the original  that s called a genetic mutation  And mutations are usually bad news  An organism often cannot survive with a mutated gene  And so a gene usually cannot be passed on  unless it s an exact copy  For memes however  fidelity is not always so important  For example  if you tell someone the alligator story I told you today  it probably won t be word for word exactly as I said it  Still  it will be basically the same story  and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it along  

Other memes are replicated with higher fidelity though  like the twinkle  twinkle song  It had the exact same words 20 years ago as it does now  Well  that s because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time  If you change a word  the others will usually bring you in line  They ll say   that s not how you sing it   right  

So  you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators  as memes  and analyzing them in terms of longevity  fecundity and fidelity  we can gain some insight about how they spread  persist or change 

 
TPO 5 Lecture 2 Astronomy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Astronomy Class

Professor 
Last week  we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon  But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing too  um… not the least of which is trying to pinpoint the moon s age  

We could do this in theory by studying an enormous impact crater  known as the South Pole Aitken Basin  Um…it s located in the moon s South Polar Region  But  since it s on the far side of the moon  it can only be seen from space  

Here is an image of…we ll call it the SPA Basin  This color coated image of the SPA Basin  those aren t its actual colors obviously  this image is from the mid 90s  from the American spacecraft called Clementine  Um… unlike earlier lunar missions  Clementine didn t orbit only around the moon s equator  Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this topographical map of … well  the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South Pole  the purples and blues in the middle correspond to low elevations   the SPA Basin itself  the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations  

The basin measures an amazing 2 500 km in diameter  and its average depth is 12 km  That makes it the biggest known crater in our solar system and it may well be the oldest  You know planetary researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them  how they redistributed pieces of the planet s crust  And in this case  we especially want to know if any of the mantle  the layer beneath the crust  was exposed by the impact  Not everyone agrees  but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA Basin did penetrate the Moon s mantle  And we need to find out  because much more than the crust  the mantle contains information about a planet s or Moon s total composition  And that s key to understanding planet formation  Um…Dian 

Dian  
So  the only way to know the basin s age is to study its rocks directly 

Professor 
Well  from radio survey data  we know that the basin contains lots of smaller craters  So it must be really old  about 4 billion years  give or take a few hundred million years  But that s not very precise  If we had rock samples to study  we d know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of planetary formation  or if they resulted from later meteor showers 

Dian  
But if we know around how old the Basin is  I m not sure that s reason enough to go to the Moon again 

Professor  
No…  but such crude estimates…um…we can do better than that  

Besides  there s other things worth investigating  like is there water ice on the moon  Clementine s data indicated that the wall of the south polar crater was more reflective than expected  So some experts think there s probably ice there  Also  data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and by inference water less than a meter underground at both poles 

Student  
Well  if there s water  how did it get there  Underground rivers 

Professor  
We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules  Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon s poles  that water would be perpetually frozen  because the floors of those craters are always in shadow  Um…furthermore  if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust  it would be protected from evaporation 

Dian  
So are you saying there might be primitive life on the moon 

Professor 
That s not my point at all  Um… o k   say there is water ice on the moon  That would be of very practical value for a future moon base for astronauts  Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking  It could also be broken down into its component parts   oxygen and hydrogen  Oxygen could be used to breathe  and hydrogen could be turned into fuel  rocket fuel  So water ice could enable the creation of a self sustaining moon base someday  a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration 

Student  
But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make fuel and build a life support system for a moon base  wouldn t that be too expensive 

Professor  
Permanent base  maybe a ways off  but we shouldn t have to wait for that  The dust at the bottom of the SPA Basin really does have a fascinating story to tell  I wouldn t give for a few samples of it

Hmmm…I wouldn t think that would be enough  Did you concentrate mainly on form or content 

Student
Oh  definitely content  We d watch  say Lord of the Flies  and then discuss it 

Professor
Oh  that approach  treating film as literature  ignoring what makes it unique 

Student
I liked it  though 

Professor
Sure  but that kind of class  Well  I m not surprised that you are feeling a little lost  You know  we have two introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course  one in film art  techniques  technical stuff and another in film history  So students in the class you are in should be pretty far along in film studies  In fact  usually the system blocks anyone trying to sign up for a class they shouldn t be taking  who hasn t taken the courses you are required to do first as prerequisites 

Student
Well  I did have a problem with that but I discussed it with one of your office staff  and she gave me permission 

Professor
Of course  No matter how many times I tell them  they just keep on… 
Well  for your own good  I d really suggest dropping back and starting at the usual place 

Student
Yes  But I ve already been in this class for 4 weeks  I d hate to just drop it now especially since I find it so different  so interesting 

Professor
I guess so  Frankly I can t believe you ve lasted this long  These are pretty in depth theories we ve been discussing and you ve been doing OK so far  I guess  But still  the program s been designed to progress through certain stages  Like any other professional training we build on pervious knowledge 

Student
Then maybe you could recommend some extra reading I can do to… catch up 

Professor
Well  are you intending to study film as your main concentration 

Student
No  no  I am just interested  I m actually in marketing  but there seems to be a connection 

Professor
Oh…well  in…in that case  if you re taking the course just out of interest  I mean I still highly recommend signing up for the introductory courses at some point  but in the meantime  there is no harm I guess in trying to keep up with this class  The interest is clearly there  Eh  instead of any extra reading just now though  you could view some of the old introductory lectures  We have them on video  That would give you a better handle on the subject  It s still a pretty tall order  and we will be moving right along  so you will really need to stay on top of it 

Student
OK  I ve been warned  Now  could I tell you about my idea for the assignment 
 
TPO 5 Lecture 3 Chemistry
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class 

Professor
Okay  I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab assignment that s coming out so     I m gonna take a little time this morning to discuss it  So  you know the assignment has to do with Spectroscopy  right  And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that s all about  But  let s talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics  

What is Spectroscopy  Well  the simplest definition I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and light  Now  visible light consists of different colors or wavelengths  which together make up what s called spectrum  a band of colors  like you see in a rainbow  And all substances  all forms of matter  can be distinguished according to what wavelength of light they absorb and which ones they reflect  It s like  um  well  every element has  what we call  its own spectral signature  If we can read that signature  we can identify the element  And that s exactly what spectroscopy does  

Now  Laser Spectroscopy  which is the focus of your assignment  works by measuring very precisely what parts of the spectrum are absorbed by different substances  And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines  And your assignment will be to choose a discipline that interests you  and devise an experiment  

For example  I m gonna talk about art  I m interested in the art and to me it s interesting how spectroscopy is used to analyze art  Let s say a museum curator comes to you with a problem  She s come across this painting that appears to be an original   let s say  a Rembrandt  And she wants to acquire it for her museum  But she s got a problem  she s not absolutely certain it s an original  So  what do you do  How do you determine whether the painting s authentic  

Okay  Think about the scientific process  You ve got the question  Is the painting a Rembrandt  So first  you ll need to make a list of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt  Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics  

So first of all  you ll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas   his brushstrokes  how thickly he applied his paint  So you d need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt s style  You d have to know when he created his paintings  um    what pigments he used  in other words  what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint   cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes  finishes  what have you  have changed over time  

Since you re trying to verify if it s a Rembrandt  the ingredients in the pigment would need to have been used during Rembrandt s lifetime   in the 17th century  And that s where chemistry comes in  You ve got to find out what s in those pigments  learn their composition  and that requires lab work   detective work really   in a word  Spectroscopy  So  how do we use Spectroscopy  

Well  we put an infrared microscope   a spectroscope   on tiny tiny bits of paint  And using ultraviolet light we can see the spectral signature of each component part of the pigment  Then we compare these signatures with those of particular elements like zinc or lead  to determine what the pigment was made of  So  you can see why this type of analysis requires a knowledge of the history of pigments  right  How and when they were made  Say we determined a pigment was made with zinc  for example  We know the spectral signature of zinc  And it matches that of the paint sample  We also know that zinc wasn t discovered until the 18th century  And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th century  we know he couldn t have painted it  

Now  Spectroscopy has a very distinct advantage over previous methods of analyzing our works  because it s not invasive  You don t have to remove big chips of paint to do your analysis  which is what other methods require  All you do is train the microscope on tiny flecks of paint and analyze them  

Now a word or two about restoration  Sometimes original art works appear questionable or inauthentic because they ve had so many restorers add touch up layers to cover up damage  damage from the paint having deteriorated over time  Well  spectroscopy can reveal the composition of those touch up layers too  So we can find out when they were applied  Then if we want to undo some bad restoration attempts  we can determine what kind of process we can use to remove them to dissolve the paint and uncover the original  

 
TPO 5 Lecture 4 Literature
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class 

Professor
Now we can t really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folktales because there s a strong connection between these two genres  these two types of stories  In fact  many fairy tales started out as folktales  

So  what s a folktale  How would you characterize them  Jeff 

Jeff 
Well  they are old stories  traditional stories  They were passed down orally within cultures from generation to generation  so they changed a lot over time  I mean  every storyteller  or  maybe every town  might have had a slightly different version of the same folktale 

Professor 
That s right  There s local difference  And that s why we say folktales are communal  By communal  we mean they reflect the traits and the concerns of a particular community at a particular time  So essentially the same tale could be told in different communities  with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the specific community  Um  not the plot  the details of what happens in the story would remain constant  That was the thread that held the tale together  But all the other elements  like the location or characters  might be modified for each audience  

Okay  So what about fairy tales  Th…they also are found in most cultures  but how are they different from folktales  
I guess the first question is  what is a fairy tale  And don t anyone say  a story with a fairy in it  because we all know that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them  But  what else can we say about them  Mary 

Mary 
Well  they seem to be less realistic than folktales…like they have something improbable happening   a frog turning into a prince  say  Oh  that s another common element  royalty   a prince or princess  And fairy tales all seem to take place in a location that s nowhere and everywhere at the same time 

Professor 
What s the line up  How do all those stories start  Once upon a time  in a faraway land    oh  in the case of folktales  each storyteller would specify a particular location and time  though the time and location would differ for different storytellers  

With fairy tales  however  the location is generally unspecified  no matter who the storyteller is  That land far away    We ll come back to this point in a few minutes 

Student 
Um    I  I thought that a fairy tale was just a written version of an oral folktale 

Professor 
Well  not exactly  though that is how many fairy tales developed  For example  in the late 18th century  the Grimm Brothers traveled throughout what s now Germany  recording local folktales  These were eventually published as fairy tales  but not before undergoing a process of evolution  


Now  a number of things happen when an oral tale gets written down  

First  the language changes  It becomes more formal  more standard   some might say   Less colorful   It s like the difference in your language depending on whether you are talking to someone  or writing them a letter  

Second  when an orally transmitted story is written down  an authoritative version with a recognized author is created  The communal aspect gets lost  The tale no longer belongs to the community  It belongs to the world  so to speak  Because of this  elements like place and time can no longer be tailored to suit a particular audience  So they become less identifiable  more generalizable to any audience  

On the other hand  descriptions of characters and settings can be developed more completely  In folktales  characters might be identified by a name  but you wouldn t know anything more about them  But in fairy tales  people no longer have to remember plots  They re written down  right  So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like character and setting  So you get more details about the characters  about where the action takes place  what people s houses were like  ur  whether they re small cabins or grand palaces  And it s worth investing that energy because the story  now in book form  isn t in danger of being lost  Those details won t be forgotten  If a folktale isn t repeated by each generation  it may be lost for all time  But with a fairy tale  it s always there in a book  waiting to be discovered  again and again  

Another interesting difference involves the change in audience  Who the stories are meant for  Contrary to what many people believe today  folktales were originally intended for adults  not for children  So why is it that fairy tales seem targeted toward children nowadays

Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university s career services office 

Student
Hi  do you have a minute 

Employee
Sure  how can I help you 

Student
I have a couple of questions about the career fair next week 

Employee
OK  shoot 

Student
Um    well  are seniors the only ones who can go  I mean  you know  they are finishing school this year and getting their degrees and everything  And  well  it seems like businesses would wanna talk to them and not first year students like me 

Employee
No  no  the career fair is opened to all our students and we encourage anyone who s interested to go check it out 

Student
Well  that s good to know 

Employee
You ve seen the flyers and posters around campus  I assume 

Student
Sure  can t miss them  I mean  they all say where and when the fair is  just not who should attend 

Employee
Actually they do  but it s in the small print  Uh  we should probably make that part easier to reach  shouldn t we  I ll make a note of that right now  So  do you have any other questions 

Student
Yes  actually I do now  Um    since I d only be going to familiarize myself with the process  you know  check it out  I was wondering if there is anything you would recommend that I do to prepare 

Employee
That s actually a very good question  Well  as you know  the career fair is generally an opportunity for local businesses to recruit new employees  and for soon to be graduates to have interviews with several companies they might be interested in working for  Now  in your case  even though you wouldn t be looking for employment right now  it still wouldn t hurt for you to prepare much like you would if you were looking for a job 

Student
You mean  like get my resume together and wear a suit 

Employee
That s a given  I was thinking more along the lines of doing some research  The flyers and posters list all the businesses that are sending representatives to the career fair  Um    what s your major or do you to have one yet 

Student
Well  I haven t declared a major yet  but I m strongly considering accounting  See  that s part of the reason I wanna go to the fair  to help me decide if that s what I really want to study 

Employee
That s very wise  Well  I suggest that you get on the computer and learn more about the accounting companies in particular that would be attending  You can learn a lot about companies from their internet websites  Then prepare a list of questions 

Student
Questions  hmm… so  in a way  I ll be interviewing them 

Employee
That s one way of looking at it  Think about it for a second  What do you want to know about working for an accounting firm 

Student
Well  there is the job itself  and salary of course  and working conditions  I mean  would I have an office  or would I work in a big room with a zillion other employees  and…and maybe about opportunities for advancement 

Employee
See  Those re all important things to know  After you do some research  you ll be able to tailor your questions to the particular company you are talking to 

Student
Wow  I m glad I came by here  So  it looks like I ve got some work to do 

Employee
And if you plan on attending future career fairs  I recommend you sign up for one of our interview workshops 

Student
I ll do that 

 
TPO 6 Lecture 1 Economics
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class 

Professor
Now when I mention the terms  boom and bust   what does that bring to mind 

Student
The dot com crash of the  90s 

Professor
Ok  The boom in the late 1990s when all those new Internet companies sprang up and were then sold for huge amounts of money  Then the bust around 2000…2001 when many of those same Internet companies went out of business  Of course  booms aren t always followed by busts  We ve certainly seen times when local economies expanded rapidly for a while and then went back to a normal pace of growth  
But  there s a type of rapid expansion  what might be called a hysterical or irrational boom that pretty much always leads to a bust  See  people often create and intensify a boom when they get carried away by some new industry that seems like it will make them lots of money fast  You d think that by the 90s  people would have learned from the past  If they did  well  look at tulips 

Student
Tulips  You mean like the flower 

Professor
Exactly  For instance  do you have any idea where tulips are from  Originally I mean 

Student
Well  the Netherlands  right 

Professor
That s what most people think  but no  They are not native to the Netherlands  or even Europe  Tulips actually hail from an area that Chinese call the Celestial Mountains in Central Asia  A very remote mountainous region  It was Turkish nomads who first discovered tulips and spread them slowly westward  

Now  around the 16th century  Europeans were traveling to Istanbul and Turkey as merchants and diplomats  And the Turks often gave the Europeans tulip bulbs as gifts which they would carry home with them  For the Europeans  tulips were totally unheard of  Er…a great novelty  The first bulb to show up in the Netherlands  the merchant who received them roasted and ate them  He thought they were kind of onion  

It turns out that the Netherlands was an ideal country for growing tulips  It had the right kind of sandy soil for one thing  but also  it was a wealthy nation with a growing economy  willing to spend lots of money on new exotic things  Plus  the Dutch had a history of gardening  Wealthy people would compete  spending enormous amounts of money to buy the rarest flowers for their gardens  Soon tulips were beginning to show up in different colors as growers tried to breed them specifically for colors which would make them even more valuable  But they were never completely sure what they would get  Some of the most prized tulips were white with purple streaks  or red with yellow streaks on the petals  even a dark purple tulip that was very much prized  

What happened then was a craze for these specialized tulips  We called that craze  tulip mania   So  here we ve got all the conditions for an irrational boom  a prospering economy  so more people had more disposable income money to spend on luxuries  but they weren t experienced at investing their new wealth  Then along comes a thrilling new commodity  Sure the first specimens were just plain old red tulips  but they could be bred into some extraordinary variations  like the dark purple tulip  And finally  you have an unregulated market place  no government constraints  where prices could explode  And explode they did  starting in the 1630s  

There was always much more demand for tulips than supply  Tulips didn t bloom frequently like roses  Tulips bloomed once in the early spring  And that was it for the year  Eventually  specially bred multicolored tulips became so valuable  well  according to records  one tulip bulb was worth 24 tons of wheat  or a thousand pounds of cheese  One particular tulip bulb was sold and exchanged for a small ship  In other words  tulips were literally worth their weight in gold  

As demand grew  people began selling promissory notes guaranteeing the future delivery of prized tulip bulbs  The buyers of these pieces of paper would resell the notes at marked up prices  These promissory notes kept changing hands from buyer to buyer until the tulip was ready for delivery  But it was all pure speculation because as I said  there was no way to know if the bulb was really going to produce the variety  the color that was promised  But that didn t matter to the owner of the note  The owner only cared about having that piece of paper so it could be traded later at a profit  And people were borrowing  mortgaging their homes in many cases to obtain those bits of paper because they were sure they found an easy way to make money  

So now  you ve got all the ingredients for a huge bust  And bust it did  when one cold February morning in 1637  a group of bulb traders got together and discovered that suddenly there were no bidders  Nobody wanted to buy  Panic spread like wild fire and the tulip market collapsed totally 
 
TPO 6 Lecture 2 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor
Ok  I have an interesting plant species to discuss with you today  Uh…it s a species of a very rare tree that grows in Australia  Eidothea hardeniana  but it s better known as the Nightcap Oak  

Now  it was discovered only very recently  just a few years ago  Um… it remained hidden for so long because it s so rare  There are only about 200 of them in existence  They grow in a rain forest  in a mountain rage…range in the north part of New South Wales which is uh… a state in Australia  So just 200 individual trees in all  

Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is…it represents…uh…a very old type…uh…kind of tree that grew a hundred million years ago  Um  we found fossils that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree  So  it s a primitive tree  A…a living fossil you might say  It s relic from earlier times and it has survived all these years without much change  And it…it s probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved  

Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about  Here s a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers  I don t know how well you can see the flowers  They re those little clusters sitting at the base of the leaves  

Okay  what have we tried to find out about the tree since we ve discovered it  Hmm…or how…why is…is it so rare  It s one of the first questions  Um… how is it…um…how does it reproduce  It s another question  Um  maybe those two questions are actually related  Jim 

Student
Hmm …I don t know  But I can imagine that…for instance  seed dispersal might be a factor  I mean if the…er…you know  if the seeds cannot really disperse in the wild area  then  you know  the tree may not colonize new areas  It can t spread from the area where it s growing 

Professor
Right  That s…that s actually a very good answer  Uh  of course  you might think there might not be many areas where the tree could spread into  er…because…um…well  it s very specialized in terms of the habitat  But  that s not really the case here  Um…the suitable habitat  that is  the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap Oak grows  

Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you  Um…um…it produces a fruit  much like a plum  On the inci…inside there s a seed with a hard shell  It…it appears that the shell has to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to soak up water  You know  if the Nightcap Oak remains…if their seeds remain locked inside their shell  they will not germinate  Actually  the seeds…er…they don t retain the power to germinate for very long  maybe two years  So there s actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate  So the shell somehow has to be broken down before this…um…germination ability expires  And…and then there s a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well  So  given all these limitations  not many seeds that the tree produces will actually germinate  So this is a possible explanation for why the tree does not spread  It doesn t necessarily explain how it became so rare  but it explains why it doesn t increase  

OK  so it seems to be the case that the species  this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading  However  it seems  though we can t be sure  that it s very good at persisting as a population  Um…we…there s some indications to suggest that the population of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last  er…you know  many hundreds of years  So it s stayed quite stable  It s not a remnant of some huge population that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some reason  It s not necessarily a species in retreat  Ok  so it cannot spread very well  but it s good at maintaining itself  It s rare  but it s not disappearing 

Ok  the next thing we might want to ask about a plant like that is what chances does it have to survive into the future  Let s look at that 
 
TPO 6 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor 

Student
Professor Martin 

Professor
Uh  hi  Lisa  what can I do for you 

Student
Well  I ve been thinking about  you know  what you were saying in class last week  about how we shouldn t wait until the last minute to find an idea and get started working on our term paper
 
Professor
Good  good  and have you come up with anything 

Student
Well  yeah  sort of  See  I ve never had a linguistics class before  so I was sort of  I mean  I was looking over the course description and a lot of the stuff you described there  I just don t know what it is talking about  you know  or what it means  But there was one thing that really did jump out at me 

Professor
Yes 

Student
The section on dialects   cause…like  that s the kind of thing that s always sort of intrigued me  you know 

Professor
Well  that s certainly an interesting topic  But you may not realize  I mean  the scope   

Student
Well  especially now   cause I ve got like one roommate who is from the south and another one from New York  And we all talk like totally different  you know

Professor
Yes  I understand  But…

Student
But then I was noticing  like  we don t really get into this till the end of the semester  you know  So I…

Professor
So  you want some pointers where to go for information on the subject  Well  you could always start by reading the chapter in the book on sociolinguistics  That will give you a basic understanding of the key issues involved here 

Student
Yeah  that s what I thought  So I started reading the chapter  you know  about how everyone speaks some dialect of a language  And I m wondering like  well  how do we even manage to understand each other at all 

Professor
Ah  yes  an interesting question  You see…

Student
So then I read the part about dialect accommodation  You know  the idea that people tend to adapt their speaking to make it closer to the speech of whomever they re talking to  and I m thinking  yeah  I do that when I talk with my roommates  and without even thinking about it or anything  you know 

Professor
OK  all right  Dialect accommodation is a more manageable sort of topic 

Student
So I was thinking like  I wonder just how much other people do the same thing  I mean  there are students here from all over the place  Does everyone change the way they talk to some degree depending on whom they are talking to 

Professor
You d be surprised 

Student
So  anyway  my question is  do you think it d be OK if I did a project like that for my term paper  You know  find students from different parts of the country  record them talking to each other in different combinations  report on how they accommodate their speech or not  that kind of thing 

Professor
Tell you what  Lisa  write me up a short proposal for this project  how you re going to carry out the experiment and everything  a design plan  And I think this ll work out just fine 
 
TPO 6 Lecture 3 Creative Writing
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a creative writing class 

Professor
Alright everybody  the topic for today is  well  we re gonna take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you re writing  One way of doing that is to come up with what s called  a character sketch   I don t mean a sketch like a drawing  I guess that s obvious  It s um…it s a…a sketch is a way of getting started on defining your characters  personalities  

To begin  how do we create fictional characters  We don t just pull them from thin air  do we  I mean we don t create them out of nothing  We base them  consciously or unconsciously  we base them on real people  or we blend several people s traits  their attributes into one character  But when people think fiction  they may assume the characters come from the author s imagination  But the writer s imagination is influenced by… by real people  could be anyone  so  pay attention to the people you meet  someone in class  at the gym  that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house  um… your cousin  who s always getting into dangerous situations  We re pulling from reality  gathering bits and pieces of real people  You use these people  and the bits of behavior or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to sketch out your characters  

Here is what you should think about doing first  When you begin to formulate a story  make a list of interesting people you know or have observed  Consider why they re unique or annoying  Then make notes about their unusual or dominant attributes  As you create fictional characters  you ll almost always combine characteristics from several different people on your list to form the identity and personality of just one character  Keeping this kind of character sketch can help you solidify your character s personality  so that it remains consistent throughout your story  

You need to define your characters  know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are predictable  consistent with their personalities  Get to know them like a friend  you know your friends well enough to know how they ll act in certain situations  right  Say you have three friends  their car runs out of gas on the highway  John gets upset  Mary remains calm  Teresa takes charge of handling the situation  And let s say  both John and Mary defer to her leadership  They call you to explain what happen  And when John tells you he got mad  you re not surprised  because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong  Then he tells you how Teresa took charge  calmed him down  assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way  Again  you re not surprised  It s exactly what you d expect  Well  you need to know your characters  like you know your friends  If you know a lot about a person s character  it s easy to predict how they ll behave  So if your characters  personalities are well defined  it will be easy for you as the writer to portray them realistically…er… believably  in any given situation  

While writing character sketches  do think about details  Ask yourself questions  even if you don t use the details in your story  um…what does each character like to eat  what setting does each prefer  the mountains  the city  what about educational background  their reactions to success or defeat  write it all down  

But  here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall  Don t make your character into a stereotype  Remember the reader needs to know how your character is different from other people who might fall in the same category  Maybe your character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years  To make sure he is not a stereotype  ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting  Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the  ragged mountain dweller   

Okay  now  I ll throw out a little terminology  It s easy stuff  Major characters are sometimes called  round characters   Minor characters are sometimes called  well  just the opposite   flat   A round character is fully developed  a flat character isn t  character development is fairly limited  The flat character tends to serve mainly as a motivating factor  For instance  you introduce a flat character who has experienced some sort of defeat  And then your round  your main character who loves success and loves to show off  comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the flat character s defeat in front of others  humiliates the other guy  The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to show off  

 
TPO 6 Lecture 4 Earth Science
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class 

Professor
We re really just now beginning to understand how quickly drastic climate change can take place  We can see past occurrences of climate change that took place over just a few hundred years  

Take uh… the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa  The Sahara was really different 6 000 years ago  I mean  you wouldn t call it a tropical paradise or anything  uh…or maybe you would if you think about how today in some parts of the Sahara it…it only rains about once a century  Um… but basically  you had greenery and you had water  

And what I find particularly interesting    amazing really  what really indicates how undesert like the Sahara was thousands of years ago  was something painted on the rock  prehistoric art  hippopotamuses  as you know hippos need a lot of water and hence  Hence what  

Student
They need to live near a large source of water year around 

Professor
That s right 

Student
But how is that proof that the Sahara used to be a lot wetter  I mean the people who painted those hippos  well  couldn t they have seen them on their travels 

Professor
Okay  in principle they could  Karl  But the rock paintings aren t the only evidence  Beneath the Sahara are huge aquifers  basically a sea of fresh water  that s perhaps a million years old filtered through rock layers  And…er…and then there is fossilized pollen  from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara  In fact these plants still grow  er…but hundreds of miles away  in more vegetated areas  Anyway  it s this fossilized pollen along with the aquifers and the rock paintings  these three things are all evidence that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today  that there were hippos and probably elephants and giraffes and so on  

Student
So what happened  

Professor
How did it happen  Well  Now  we re so used to hearing about how human activities are affecting the climate  right  But that takes the focus away from the natural variations in the earth climate  like the Ice Age  right  The planet was practically covered in ice just a few thousand years ago  Now as far as the Sahara goes  there is some recent literature that points to the migration of the monsoon in that area

Students
Huh 

Professor
What do I mean  Okay  a monsoon is a seasonal wind that can bring in a large amount of rainfall  Now if the monsoon migrates  well  that means that the rains move to another area  right  

So what caused the monsoon to migrate  Well  the answer is  the dynamics of earth s motions  the same thing that caused the Ice Age by the way  The earth s not always the same distance from the sun  and it s not always tilting toward the sun at the same angle  There are slight variations in these two parameters  They re gradual variations but their effects can be pretty abrupt  And can cause the climate to change in just a few hundred years 

Student
That s abrupt 

Professor
Well  yeah  considering that other climate shifts take thousands of years  this one is pretty abrupt  So these changes in the planet s motions  they caused the climate to change  

But it was also compounded  What the Sahara experienced was uh…a sort of  runaway drying effect   As I said the monsoon migrated itself  so there was less rain in the Sahara  The land started to get drier  which in turn caused a huge decrease in the amount of vegetation  because vegetation doesn t grow as well in dry soil  right  And then  less vegetation means the soil can t hold water as well  the soil loses its ability to retain water when it does rain  So then you have less moisture to help clouds form  nothing to evaporate for cloud formation  And then the cycle continues  less rain  drier soil  less vegetation  fewer clouds  less rain etc  etc   

Student
But  what about the people who made the rock paintings 

Professor
Good question  No one really knows  But there might be some connections to ancient Egypt  At about the same time that the Sahara was becoming a desert…hmm    5 000 years ago  Egypt really began to flourish out in the Nile River valley  And that s not that far away  So it s only logical to hypothesize that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile valley when they realized that this was more than a temporary drought  And some people take this a step further  And that s okay  that s science and they hypothesize that this migration actually provided an important impetus in the development of ancient Egypt  Well  we ll stay tuned on that

Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor  

Eric  Hi  Professor Mason  do you have a minute 

Pro  Yeah  of course  Eric  I think there was something I wanted to talk to you about too 

Eric  Probably my late essay 

Pro  Ah  that must be it  I thought maybe I ve lost it 

Eric  No  I m sorry  Actually it was my computer that lost it  the first draft of it  And  well  anyway  I finally put it in your mailbox yesterday 

Pro  Oh and I haven t checked the mailbox yet today  Well  I m glad it s there  I will read it this weekend 

Eric  Well  sorry again  Say  I can send it to you by email too if you like 

Pro  Great  I ll be interested to see how it all came out 

Eric  Right  Now  um  I just have overheard some graduate students  talking  something about a party for Dean Adams 

Pro  Retirement party  yes  all students are invited  Wasn t there notice on the Anthropology Department s bulletin board 

Eric  Uh  I don t know  But I want to offer help out with it  You know whatever you need  Dean Adams  well  I took a few anthropology classes with her and they were great  inspiring  That s why I want to pitch in 

Pro  Oh  that s very thoughtful of you  Eric  but it will be pretty low key  nothing flashy  That s not her style 

Eric  So there s nothing 

Pro  No  we ll have coffee and cookies  maybe a cake  But actually a couple of the administrative assistants are working on that  You could ask them but I think they ve got covered 

Eric  Ok 

Pro  Actually  oh  no  never mind 

Eric  What s it 

Pro  Well  it s nothing to do with the party and I m sure there are more exciting ways that you could spend your time  But we do need some help with something  We re compiling a database of articles the anthropology faculty has published  There is not much glory in it  but we are looking for someone with some knowledge of anthropology who can enter the articles  I hesitate to mention it  But I don t suppose this is something you would   

Eric  No  that sounds kind of cool  I would like to see what they are writing about 

Pro  Wonderful  And there are also some unpublished studies  Did you know Dean Adams did a lot of field research in Indonesia  Most of it hasn t been published yet 

Eric  No  like what 

Pro  Well  she is really versatile  She just spent several months studying social interactions in Indonesia and she s been influential in ethnology  Oh  and she s also done work in south of America  this is closer to biology  especially with speciation 

Eric  uh  not to seem uninformed   

Pro  Well  how species form  You know  how two distinct species form from one  Like when populations of the same species are isolated from each other and then develop into two different directions and end up as two distinct species 

Eric  Interesting 

Pro  Yes  and while she was there in South America  she collected a lot of linguistic information and songs  really fascinating 

Eric  Well  I hate to see her leave 

Pro  Don t worry  She ll still be around  She s got lots of projects that she s still in the middle of 


 
TPO 7 Lecture 1 Theater History
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a class on theater history  The professor is discussing the theater of 19th century France 

Pro  The 19th century was the time that saw what we called Realism developed in the European theater  Um… to understand this though  we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well made play  which basically was a pattern for constructing plays  plays that    uh   beginning with some early 19th century comedies in France proved very successful commercially  

The dramatic devices used here weren t actually anything new  They had been around for centuries  But the formula for a well made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a particular order  And most importantly  that everything in the plays be logically connected  In fact  some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning  just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before  

Ok  so what are the necessary elements of a well made play  

Well  the first is logical exposition  Exposition is whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience  So  they ll understand what is going on  Before this time  exposition might have come from actors simply giving speeches  Someone might walk out on a stage and say   In fair Verona where we lay our scene   and then tell all about the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet  But for the well made play  even the exposition had to be logical  believable  So  for example  you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house  And one says  Oh  what a shame the master s son is still not married  And the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who s just moved into town with his beautiful daughter  These comments are part of the play s logical exposition 

The next key element of the a well made play is referred to as the inciting incident  After we have the background information  we need a key moment that gets things moving  that really makes the audience interested in what happens to the characters we just heard about  So  for example  after the two servants reveal all this background information  we meet the young man  Just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman  and immediately falls in love  This is the inciting incident  It sets off  the plot of the play  

Now  the plot of a well made play is usually driven by secrets  Things that the audience knows  but the characters often don t know  So  for example  the audience learns through a letter or through someone else s conversation who this mysterious gentleman is and why he left the town many years before  But the young man doesn t know about this  And the woman doesn t understand the ancient connection between her family and his  

And before the secrets are revealed to the main characters  the plot of the play proceeds as a series of sort of up and down moments  For example  the woman first appears not to even notice the young man  and it seems to him like the end of the world  But then  he learns that she actually wants to meet him too  So  life is wonderful  Then  if he tries to talk with her  maybe her father get furious  for no apparent reason  So  they can t see each other  But  just as the young man has almost lost all hope  he finds out  well you get the idea  the reversals of fortune continue  increasing the audience s tension and excitement  making them wonder if everything is going to come out okay or not  

Next comesan element known as the  obligatory scene  It s a scene  a moment in which all the secrets are revealed  And generally  things turn out well for the hero and others we care about  a happy ending of some sort  This became so popular that a playwright almost had to include it in every play  which is why it s called  the obligatory scene  

And that s followed by the final dramatic element   the denouement or the resolution  when all the loose ends have to be tied up in a logical way  Remember  the obligatory scene gives the audience emotional pleasure  But the denouement offers the audience a logical conclusion  That s the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind  

So  as I said  the well made play  this form of playwriting  became the basis for realism in drama  and for a lot of very popular 19th century plays  And also  a pattern we find in the plots of many later plays and even movies that we see today 
 
TPO 7 Lecture 2 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class 

Pro  So  that is how elephants use infrasound  Now  let s talk about the other end of the acoustical spectrum  sound that is too high for humans to hear   ultrasound  

Ultrasound is used by many animals that detect and some of them send out very high frequency sounds  So  what is a good example  Yes  Carol 

Carol  Well  bats  since they are all blind  bats have to use sound for  you know  to keep from flying into things 

Pro  That is echolocation  Echolocation is pretty self explanatory  using echoes reflected sound waves to locate things  As Carol said  bats use it for navigation and orientation  And what else  Mike 

Mike  Well  finding food is always important  and I guess not becoming food for other animals 

Pro  Right  on both counts  Avoiding other predators  and locating prey  typically insects that fly around at night  Now before I go on  let me just respond to something Carol was saying    this idea that bats are blind  Actually  there are some species of bats  the ones that don t use echolocation that do rely on their vision for navigation  but it is true that for many bats  their vision is too weak to count on  

Ok  so quick summary of how echolocation works  The bat emits these ultrasonic pulses  very high pitch sound waves that we cannot hear  And then  they analyze the echoes  how the waves bounce back  Here  let me finish this diagram I started before class  So the bat sends out these pulses  very focused bursts of sound  and echoes bounce back  You know  I don t think I need to draw on the echoes  your reading assignment for the next class  it has a diagram that shows this very clearly  

So  anyway  as I were saying  by analyzing these echoes  the bat can determine  say  if there is wall in a cave that it needs to avoid  and how far away it is  Another thing it uses ultrasound to detect is the size and shape of objects  For example  one echo they quickly identify is the one they associate with a moth  which is common prey for a bat  particularly a moth beating its wings  However  moth happened to have a major advantage over most other insects  They can detect ultrasound  this means that when a bat approaches  the moth can detect the bat s presence  So  it has time to escape to safety  or else they can just remain motionless  Since  when they stop beating their wings  they d be much harder for the bat to distinguish from  oh… a leaf or some other object  

Now  we have tended to underestimate just how sophisticated the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are  In fact  we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out  the way a sophisticated radar system can ignore echoes from stationary objects on the ground  Radar does this to remove ground clutter  information about hills or buildings that it doesn t need  But bats  we thought they were filtering out this kind of information  because they simply couldn t analyze it  But  it looks as if we were wrong  Recently there was this experiment with trees and a specific species of bats  A bat called  the lesser spear nosed bat  

Now  a tree should be a huge acoustical challenge for a bat  right  I mean it s got all kinds of surfaces with different shapes and angles  So  well  the echoes from a tree are going to a mass of chaotic acoustic reflections  right  not like the echo from a moth  So  we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at simply that is a tree  Yet  it turns out that bats or at least this particular species  cannot only tell that is a tree  but can also distinguish between  say  a pine tree  and a deciduous tree  like a maple or oak tree  just by their leaves  And when I say  leaves  I mean pine needles too  Any ideas on how it would know that 

Stu  Well  like with the moth  could it be their shape 

Pro  You are on the right track   it is actually the echo of all the leaves as whole that matters  Now  think  a pine tree with all those little densely packed needles  Those produce a large number of faint reflections in what s    what s called a     a smooth echo  The wave form is very even  but an oak which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections  produces a jagged wave form  or what we called  a rough echo  And these bats can distinguish between the two  and not just with trees  but with any echo that comes in a smooth or rough shape

Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian 

Stu  Hi  I am new here and I couldn t come to the student orientation and I m wondering if you can give me a few quick pointers about the library  I d really appreciate it 

Pro  Sure  I d be glad to  What s your major area of study 

Stu  Latin American Literature 

Pro  OK  Well  over here s the section where we have language  literature and the arts  And if you go downstairs you will find the history section  Generally  the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot 

Stu  Um hmm  you are right  I am a transfer student and I ve already done a year at another university so I know how the research can go  I spent a lot of time in the history section  So how long can I borrow books for 

Pro  Our loan period is a month  Oh I should also mention that we have an inter library loan service  If you need to get hold a book that s not in our library  there is a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area  It comes around three times a week 

Stu  Hey  that s great  At my last school  it could take a really long time to get the materials I needed  So when I had a project  I had to make a plan way in advance  This sounds much faster  Another thing I was wondering is  is there a place where I can bring my computer and hook it up 

Pro  Sure  There is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power but on top of that we also have a connection for the internet at every seat 

Stu  Nice  so I can do the all research I need to do right here in the library  I ll have all the resources  all the books and the information I need right here in one place 

Pro  Yeah  That s the idea  I am sure you ll need photocopiers too  There are down the hall to your left  We have a system where you have to use a copy card so you ll need to buy a card from the front desk  You insert it into the machine and you are ready to make copies 

Stu  How much do you guys get charge 

Pro  Seven cents a copy 

Stu  Oh  that is not too bad  Thanks  Um  where is the collection of rare books 

Pro  Rare books are up on the second floor  They are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled  to preserve the old paper in them  You need to get special permission to access them  and then you have to wear gloves to handle them  cause the oils in our hands  you know  can destroy the paper  And gloves prevent that so we have a basket of gloves in the room 

Stu  Ok  Thanks  I suppose that s all I need to know  You ve been very helpful  Thanks 

Pro  Anytime  Bye

Stu  Bye 

 
TPO 7 Lecture 3 Anthropology
Pro  So we ve been discussing 16th century Native American life  and today we re going to focus on the Iroquois and Huron peoples  They lived in the northeastern great lakes region of North America  Now  back then  their lifes depended on the natural resources of the forests  especially the birch tree  The birch tree can grow in many different types of soils and is prevalent in that area  Now can anyone here describe a birch tree 

Stu  They are tall and white  the bark  I mean 

Pro  Yes  The birch tree has white bark  and this tough protective outer layer of the tree  this white bark  is waterproof  And this waterproof quality of the bark  it made it useful for making things like cooking containers  a variety of utensils  And if you peel birch bark in the winter  we call it  the winter bark   another layer  a tougher inner layer of the tree adheres to the bark  producing a stronger material  So the winter bark was used for larger utensils and containers 

Stu  I know people make utensils out of wood  but utensils out of tree bark 

Pro  Well  birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend  The Native Americans would cut the bark and fold it into any shape they needed  then secure it with cords until it dried  They could fold the bark into many shapes 

Stu  So if they cooked in bowls made of birch bark  wouldn t that make the food taste funny 

Pro  Oh  that s one of the great things about birch bark  The taste of the birch tree doesn t get transferred to the food  So it was perfect for cooking containers  

But the most important use of the bark  by far  was the canoe  Since the northeast region of North American is interconnected by many streams and waterways  water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential  The paths through the woods were often overgrown  so water travel was much faster  And here s what the Native Americans did  They would peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy canoes  The bark was stretched over frames made from tree branches  stitched together and sealed with resin  You know that sticky liquid that comes out of the tree  And when it dries  it s watertight  

One great thing about these birch bark canoes was  uh  they could carry a large amount of cargo  For example  a canoe weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of cargo 

Stu  Wow  But how far could they travel that way 

Pro  Well like I said  the northeastern region is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the coast  The canoes allow them to travel over a vast area that today would take a few hours to fly over  You see  the Native Americans made canoes of all types  for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters  For small streams  they made narrow  maneuverable boats  while  while larger canoes were needed for the ocean  They could travel throughout the area only occasionally having to portage  to carry the canoe over a land short distance to another nearby stream  And since the canoes were so light  this wasn t a difficult task  

Now how do you think this affected their lives 

Stu  Well if they could travel so easily over such a large area  they could trade with people from other areas which I guess would lead them to form alliances 

Pro  Exactly  Having an efficient means of transportation  well  that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by natural waterways  And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Dalever River  And this efficiency of the birch bark canoe also made an impression on newcomers to the area  French traders in the 17th century modeled their   well they adopted the design of the Iroquois birch bark canoes  and they found they could travel great distances more than 15 kilometers a month  

Now besides the bark  Native Americans also used the wood of the birch tree  The young trees were used as supports for lodgings  with the waterproof bark used as roofing  Branches were folded into snowshoes  And the Native American people were all adept at running very fast over the snow in these birch branch snowshoes  which if you ever tried walking in snowshoes you know it wasn t easy 
 
TPO 7 Lecture 4 Geology
Last time  we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow  and some of you were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are  Now  even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass of ice can move or flow  it s another word for it  it s really known that no secret that the glaciers flow because of gravity  But how they flow  the way they flow  needs some explaining  

Now  the first type of glacier flow is called  basal slip  Basal slip or sliding as it s often called  basically refers to the slipping or sliding of a glacier across bedrock  actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock  So  this process shouldn t be too hard to imagine  What happens is that the ice at the base of the glacier is under a great deal of pressure   the pressure coming from the weight of the overlying ice  And you probably know that under pressure  the melting temperature of water  of the ice I mean  is reduced  So  ice at the base of the glacier melts  even though it s below zero degree Celsius  And this results in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground  This layer of water reduces friction is    is like a lubricant  And it allows the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock  OK 

Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called  deformation  You v already known that ice is brittle  if you hit it with a hammer  it will shatter like glass  But ice is also plastic  it can change shape without breaking  If you leave  for example  a bar of ice supported only at one end  the end  the unsupported end will deform under its own weight  it ll kind of flatten out at one end  get distorted  deformed  Think of deformation as a very slow oozing  Depending on the stresses on the glacier  the ice crystal within it reorganize  And during this re organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to slide pass each other  And so the glacier oozes downhill without any ice actually melting  

Now  there are a couple of factors that affect the amount of deformation that takes place or the speed of the glacier s movement for example  Deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ice is  because of the gravity of the weight of the ice  And temperature also plays a part here  in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the melting point  in fact  it is not too different from… the way oil is  thicker at lower temperatures  So  if you have a glacier in a slightly warmer region  it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region  

Ok  um… Now  I d like to touch briefly on extension and compression  Your textbook includes these as types  as a particular type of glacier movement  but you will see that there are …as many textbooks that omit it as a type of movement as include it  And I might not include it right now  if it weren t in your textbook  But  basically  the upper parts of glaciers have less pressure on them  So  they don t deform easily  they tend to be more brittle  And crevasses can form in this upper layers of the glacier  When the glacier comes into contact with bedrock walls or is otherwise under some kind of stress  but can t deform quickly enough  So  the ice would expand or constrict  and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice  and that brittle surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of glacier movement depending on which source you are consulting  

Now  as you probably know  glaciers generally move really slowly  But sometimes  they experience surges  and during these surges  in some places  they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year  Now  speeds like that are pretty unusual  hundreds of times faster than the regular movement of glaciers  but you can actually see glacier move during these surges  though it is rare

Listen to a conversation between a student and a registrar 

Stu  Hi  I d like to drop off my graduation form  I understand you need this in order to process my diploma 

Pro  Ok  I will take that  Before you leave  let s me check our computer  Looks like you are OK for graduation  and actually  I am getting a warning flag on your academic record here 

Stu  Really 

Pro  Yeah  Let s see what s what  Are you familiar with our graduation requirements 

Stu  Uh  I think so

Pro  Well  then you know you need 48 credits in your major field to graduate and at least 24 credits at the intermediate level or higher  Also  after your second year  you have to meet with your department chair to outline a plan for the rest of your time here  In the past  we also issue letters before students  final year began to let them know what they needed to take in the final year to be OK  but we don t do that anymore 

Stu  I definitely met with my chair person 2 years ago  He told me that I needed 8 more courses at the intermediate level or higher in the last 2 years to be OK  So I am not sure what the problem is  I make sure I got those credits 

Pro  Unfortunately  the computer is usually pretty reliable  So I am not sure what s going on here 

Stu  It could be that I have taken 2 basic courses but coupled both of them with  uh  field experiences 

Pro  What do you mean 

Stu  Well  I could only take intro courses because there were no intermediate level courses available for those particular topics  My chair person told me that if I did independent field research in addition to the assigned work in each course  they would count as intermediate level courses  My classmates  um  some of my classmates  did this for an easy way to meet their intermediate course requirement  but I did it to get the kind of depth in those topics I was going for  As it turned out I really enjoyed the field work  it was a nice supplement to just sitting and listening to lectures

Pro  I am sure that s true  but the computer is still showing them as basic level courses despite the field work 

Stu  I am not sure what to do then  I mean  should I cancel my graduation party 

Pro  No  no reason to get worried like that  just contact your chair person immediately  ok  tell him to call me as soon as possible so that we can verify your field work arrangement and certify those credits right away  It s not like there is an actual deadline to date or anything  But if more than a few weeks go by  we might have a real problem that would very difficult to fix in time for you to graduate  In fact  there probably would be nothing we could do 

Stu  I will get on that 

 
TPO 8 Lecture 1 Animal Behavior
Pro  OK  Well  last time we talked about passive habitat selection  like plants for example  they don t make active choices about where to grow  They are dispersed by some other agent  like the wind  And if the seeds land in a suitable habitat  they do well and reproduce  

With active habitat selection  an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed  And because an animal s breeding habitat is so important  we d expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats  places where their offspring have the best chance of survival  So let s look at the effect this preference can have by looking at some examples 

But first let s recap  What do we mean by habitat  Frank 

Stu  Well  it s basically the place or environment where an organism normally lives and grows 

Pro  Right  and as we v discussed  there are some key elements that a habitat must contain  food obviously  water  it s got to have the right climate and spaces for physical protection  And we saw how important habitat selection is when we look at habitats where some of these factors are removed  perhaps through habitat destruction  I just read about a shorebird  the plover 

The plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small shellfish  insects and plants  It blends in with the sand  so it s well camouflaged from predator birds above  But it lays its eggs in shallow depressions in the sand with very little protection around them  So if there are people or dogs on the beach  the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really vulnerable  Out in California where there has been a lot of human development by the ocean  The plovers are now a threatened species  So conservationists tried to recreate a new habitat for them  They made artificial beaches and sand bars in areas inaccessible to people and dogs  And the plover population is up quite a bit in those places 

Ok  That is an instance where a habitat is made less suitable  But now  what about cases where an animal exhibits a clear choice between two suitable habitats  In cases like that  does the preference matter  Well  Let s look at the blue warbler 

The Blue warbler is a songbird that lives in North America  They clearly prefer hard wood forests with dense shrubs  bushes underneath the trees  They actually nest in the shrubs  not the trees  So they re pretty close to the ground  but these warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density  It is usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older  more dominant birds 

And the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success  Because the older  more experienced birds who nest in the high density shrub areas have significantly more offspring than those in low density areas  which suggests that the choice of where to nest does have an impact on the number of chicks they have  

But a preferred environment doesn t always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success  For example  In Europe  studies have been done of blackcap warblers  We just call them blackcaps 

The Blackcap can be found in two different environments  Their preferred habitat is forests near the edge of streams  However  blackcaps also live in pine woods away from water  Studies have been done on the reproductive success rates for the birds in both areas  and the result showed surprisingly that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both areas    the preferred and the second choice habitat  Well  Why 

It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the stream edge habitat compared to the area away from the stream  So this stream edge area had a much denser population  which meant more members of the same species competing for resources  wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same places  which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it s their preferred habitat  So the results of the study suggest that when the number of the competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain point  the second rank habitat becomes just as successful as the prime habitat  just because there are fewer members of the same species living there  So it looks like competition for resources is another important factor in determining if a particular habitat is suitable 

 
TPO 8 Lecture 2 Art History
Pro  We ve been talking about the art world of the late 19th century in Paris  And today I d like to look at the women who went to Paris at that time to become artists  Now from your reading what do you know about Paris  about the art world of Paris during the late 19th century  

Stu  People came there from all over the world to study 

Stu  It had a lot of art schools and artists who taught painting  There were  our book mentions classes for women artists  And it was a good place to go to study art 

Pro  If you wanted to become an artist  Paris was not a good place to go  Paris was THE place to go  And women could find skilled instructors there  Before the late 19th century  If they women who wanted to become artists had to take private lessons or learn from family members  They had more limited options than men did  But around 1870s  some artists in Paris began to offer classes for female students  These classes were for women only  And by the end of the 19th century  it became much more common for women and men to study together in the same classes  So within a few decades  things had changed significantly  

OK  Let s back up again and talk about the time period from the 1860s to the 1880s and talk more about what happened in women s art classes  In 1868  a private art academy opened in Paris  and for decades it was probably the most famous private art school in the world  Its founder Rodolphe Julian was a canny businessman  And quickly established his school as a premier destination for women artists  What he did was  After an initial trail period of mixed classes  he changed the school policy  He completely separated the men and women students 

Stu  Any reason why he did that 

Pro  Well  Like I said Julian was a brilliant businessman  with progressive ideas  He saw that another small private art school where all the students were women was very popular at that time  And that s probably why he adopted the women only classes  His classes were typically offered by    by established artists and were held in the studio  the place where they painted  This was a big deal because finally women could study art in a formal setting  And there was another benefit to the group setting of these classes  The classes included weekly criticism  And the teacher would rank the art of all the students in the class from best to worst  How would you like it if I did that in this class 

Stu1  Hah…No way  

Stu2  But our textbook said that the competitive…the competition was good for women  It helped them see where they needed to improve 

Pro  Isn t that interesting  One woman artist  her name was Marie Bashkirtseff  Bashkirtseff once wrote how she felt about a classmate s work  She thought her classmate s art was much better than her own and it gave her an incentive to do better  Overall the competition in the women s art classes gave women more confidence  Confidence that they could also compete in the art world after their schooling  And even though Bashkirtseff could not study in the same classes as men  she was having an impact as an artist  Just look like the salon  what do you know about the salon 

Stu  It was a big exhibition  a big art show that they had in Pairs every year  They art had to be accepted by judges 

Stu  It was a big deal you can make a name for yourself 

Pro  You can have a painting or sculpture in the salon and go back to your home country saying you  ve been a success in Paris  It was sort of uh  a seal of approval  It was a great encouragement for an artist s career  And by the last two decades of the 19th century  one fifth of the paintings in the salon were by women  much higher than in the past  

In fact  Marie Bashkirtseff herself had a painting in the salon in 1881  Interestingly this masterpiece called In the Studio is a painting of the interior of Julian s art school  It is not in your textbook  I will show you the painting next week  The painting depicts an active crowded studio with women drawing and painting a live model  It was actually Bashkirtseff  actually followed Julian s savvy suggestion and painted her fellow students in a class at the school with the artist herself at the far right  A great advertisement for the school when the painting eventually hung up at the salon  for a women s studio had never been painted before

Pro  So  Richard    what s up 

Student Well  I know we have a test coming up on chapters 

Pro  Chapters 3 and 4 from your textbook 

Student  Right  3 and 4  well  I didn t get something you said in class Monday 

Pro  Alright  Do you remember what it was about 

Student  Yeah  you were talking about a gym    a health club where people can go to exercise  that kind of thing 

Pro  Ok  but the health club model is actually from chapter 5 so…

Student  Oh  chapter 5  Oh so it not    OK but I guess I still want to try to understand…

Pro  Of course  well  I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing  the healthy club model  I mean with a health club you might think they would have trouble attracting customers right 

Student  Well  I know when I pass by a healthy club and I see all those people working out  they re exercising  I just as soon walk on by 

Pro  Yes  there is that  Plus  lots of people have exercise equipment at home  or they can play sports with their friends  Right 

Student  Sure 

Pro  But nowadays in spite of all that  and expensive membership fees  health clubs are hugely popular  so how come 

Student  I guess that is what I didn t understand 

Pro  Ok  basically they have to offer things that most people can t find anywhere else  you know quality  that means better exercise equipment  high end stuff  and classes    exercise classes  maybe aerobics 

Student  I am not sure if I…ok I get it  And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves when they are at the gym  And they can meet new people  socialize 

Pro  Right  so health clubs offer high quality facilities  And also they sell an image about people having more fun  relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members 

Student  Sure that makes sense 

Pro  Well  then  can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this  Think about an important building on campus here  something everyone uses  a major source of information 

Student  You mean like an administrative building 

Pro  Well  that is not what I had in my mind 

Student  You mean the library 

Pro  Exactly  Libraries  imagine publish libraries  They re an information resource for the whole community right 

Student  Well they can be  but now with the internet and big book stores  you can probably get what you need without going to a library 

Pro  That s true  So if you were the director of a public library  what would you do about that 

Student  To get more people to stop in  well  like you said  better equipment  maybe a super fast internet connection  and not just a good variety of books but also like nice and comfortable areas where people can read and do research  Things that make them want to come to the library and stay 

Pro  Great 

Student  Oh  and maybe have authors come and do some readings or     I don t know  special presentations  Something people couldn t get at home 

Pro  Now  you are getting it 

Student  Thanks  Professor Wilkins  I think too 

 
TPO 8 Lecture 3 History
Pro  So we ve been talking about the printing press  how it changed people s lives  making books more accessible to everyone  More books meant more reading  right  But  as you know  not everyone has perfect vision  This increase in literacy  um  in reading  led to an increase in demand for eyeglasses  And here s something you probably haven t thought of  This increased demand impacted societal attitudes towards eyeglasses  

But  first let me back up a bit and talk about vision correction before the printing press  And  um  what did people with poor vision do  I mean  especially those few people who were actually literate  What did they do before glasses were invented  Well  they had different ways of dealing with not seeing well  If you think about it  poor vision wasn t their only problem  I mean  um  think about the conditions they lived in  houses were dark  sometimes there weren t any windows  candles were the only source of light  So in some places  um  like ancient Greece for example  the wealthiest people with poor vision could have someone else read to them  easy solution if you could afford it  

Another solution was something called a  reading stone   Around 1000 C E  European monks would take a piece of clear rock  often quartz  and place it on top of the reading material  The clear rock magnified the letters  making them appear larger  um  well  it s like what happens when a drop of water falls on something  whatever s below the drop of water appears larger  right  Well  the  reading stone  works in a similar way  

But rocks like quartz  well  quartz of optical quality weren t cheap  Late in the 13th century  glass makers in Italy came up with a less expensive alternative  They made reading stones out of clear glass  And these clear glass reading stones evolved into the eyeglasses we know today  So we re pretty sure that glasses were invented about the late 1200 s  well  over a hundred years before the printing press  But it s not clear who exactly invented them first or exactly what year  But record shows that they were invented in both Europe and China at about the same time  By the way  we call this  independent discovery   Independent discovery means when something is invented in different parts of the world at the same time and it s not as unusual as it sounds  You can look at the timeline charts in the back of your textbook to see when things were invented in different cultures at about the same time to see what I m talking about 

So now let s tie this to what I ve said before about societal attitudes towards glasses  Initially in parts of Europe and in China  glasses were a symbol of wisdom and intelligence  This is evident in the artwork from the period  European paintings often portrayed doctors or judges wearing glasses  In China  glasses were very expensive  So in addition to intelligence  they also symbolize affluence  um  wealth  In 14th century Chinese portraits  the bigger the glasses  the smarter and wealthier the subject was  So glasses were a status symbol in some parts of the world  

Now let s get back to the invention of the painting press in 1440  What happened  Suddenly  books became readily available and more people wanted to read  So the need  oh well  actually not only the need but the demand for more affordable glasses rose drastically  Eventually  inexpensive glasses were produced  and then glasses were available to everyone  People could purchase them easily from a traveling peddler 

 
TPO8 Lecture 4 Chemistry
Pro  So  are there any questions 

Student  Yes  um  Professor Harrison  you were saying that the periodic table is predictive  What exactly does that mean  I mean I understand how it organizes the elements but where s the prediction 

Pro  Ok  let s look at our periodic table again  Ok  it groups elements into categories that share certain properties  right 

Stu  Uh huh 

Pro  And it is arranged according to increasing atomic number  which is…

Student  The number of protons in each atom of an element 

Pro  Right  well  early versions of the periodic table had gaps  missing elements  Every time you had one more proton  you had another element  And then  oops  there d be an atomic number  for which there was no known element  And the prediction was that an element with that atomic number existed somewhere  but it just hadn t been found yet  And its location in the table would tell you what properties it should have  It was really pretty exciting for scientists at that time to find these missing elements and confirm their predictive properties  

Um  actually  that reminds of a     of a very good example of all these  element 43  See on the table  the symbols for elements 42 and 44  Well  in early versions of the table  there was no symbol for an element 43 protons because no element with 43 protons had been discovered yet  So the periodic table had a gap between elements 42 and 44  

And then in 1925  a team of chemists led by a scientist named Ida Tacke claimed that they had found element 43  They had been using a relatively new technology called X ray spectroscopy  and they were using this to examine an ore sample  And they claimed that they d found an element with 43 protons  And they named it Masurium 

Student  Um  Professor Harrison  then  how come in my periodic table here  element 43 is Tc  that s Technetium  right 

Pro  Ok  let me add that  Actually  um  that s the point I m coming to  Hardly anyone believed that Tacke d discovered a new element  X ray spectroscopy was a new method at that time  And they were never able to isolate enough Masurium to have a weighable sample to convince everyone of the discovery  So they were discredited  

But then  12 years later in 1937  a different team became the first to synthesize an element using a cyclotron  And that element had…

Student  43 protons 

Pro  That s right  but they named it Technetium to emphasize that it was artificially created with technology  And people thought that synthesizing this element  making it artificially was the only way to get it  We still hadn t found it occuring in nature  
Now element 43  whether you call it Masurium or Technetium  is radioactive  Why does that matter  What is true of a radioactive element 

Student  It decays  it turns into other elements  Oh  so does that explain why it was missing in the periodic table 

Pro  Exactly  because of its radioactive decay  element 43 doesn t last very long  And therefore  if that ever had been present on Earth  it would have decayed ages ago  So the Masurium people were obviously wrong  and the Technetium people were right  Right  Well  that was then  now we know that element 43 does occur naturally  It can be naturally generated from Uranium atoms that have spontaneously split  And guess what  the ore sample the Masurium group was working with had plenty of Uranium in it enough to split into measurable amounts of Masurium  So Tacke s team might very well have found small amounts of Masurium in the ore sample  It s just that once was generated from split Uranium  it decayed very quickly  

And you know here s an incredible irony  Ida Tacke  the chemist led the Masurium team  well  she was the first to suggest that Uranium could break up into smaller pieces  but she didn t know that that was the defense of her own discovery of element 43 

Student  So is my version of the periodic table wrong  Should element 43 really be called Masurium 

Pro  Maybe  but you know it s hard to tell for sure after all this time  if Ida Tacke s group did discover element 43  They didn t  um  publish enough detail on their methods or instruments for us to know for sure  But I d like to think element 43 was discovered twice  As Masurium  it was the first element discovered that occurs in nature only from spontaneous fission  and as Technetium  it was the first element discovered in a laboratory  And of course  it was an element the periodic table let us to expect existed before anyone had found it or made it

Conversation 1
Listen to a conversation between a student and her professor 

P  Before we get started  I   I just wanted to say I m glad you chose food science for your major course of study  
S  Yeah  it seems like a great industry to get involved with  I mean with a four year degree in food science  I ll always be able to find a job  
P  You re absolutely right  Before entering academia  I worked as a scientist for several food manufacturers and for the US Food and Drug Administration  I even worked on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska a couple of summers while I was an undergraduate  We d bring in the day s catch to a floating processor boat where the fish got cleaned  packaged and frozen right at sea  
S  That s amazing  As a matter of fact  I m sort of interested in food packaging  
P  Well  for that  you ll need a strong background in physics  math and chemistry  
S  Those are my best subjects  For a long time  I was leaning towards getting my degree in engineering  
P  Well  then you shouldn t have a problem  Uh  and fortunately  at this university  the department of food science offers a program in food packaging  Elsewhere  you might have to hammer courses together on your own  
S  I guess I luck out then  I am… so since my appointment today is to discuss my term paper topic  I wanted to ask  could I write about food packaging  I realize we re supposed to research food born bacteria  but food packaging must play a role in all of that  right  
P  Absolutely  Maybe you should do some preliminary research on that  
S  I have  That s the problem  I m overwhelmed  
P  Well  in your reading  did anything interest you in particular  I mean something you d like to investigate  
S  well  I was surprised about the different types of packaging used for milk  You know  clear plastic bottles  opaque bottles  carton board containers    
P  True  In fact  the type of packaging has something to do with the way milk s treated against bacteria  
S  Yeah  and I read a study that showed how light can give milk a funny flavor and decrease its nutritional value  And yet most milk bottles are clear  What s up about that  
P  Well consumers like being able to visually examine the color of the milk  That might be one reason that opaque bottles haven t really caught on  But that study    I m sure there is more studies on the subject  You shouldn t base your paper on only one study  
S  Maybe I should write about those opaque plastic bottles  Find out if there is any scientific reasons they aren t used more widely  Maybe opaque bottles aren t as good at keeping bacteria from growing in milk after the bottle has been opened for something… but where to begin researching this  I don t have a    
P  You know  there is a dairy not far from here in Chelsea  It was one of the first diaries to bottle milk in opaque plastic  but now they re using clear plastic again  And they re always very supportive of the university and our students  so if you wanted    
S  Yeah  I like that idea  
 
TPO 9 Lecture 1 Theater

Listen to part of a lecture in a theater class 

Pro  As we have seen  the second half of the 18th century was an exciting time in Europe  it was not only an age of great invention  but social changes also led to a rise in all sorts of entertainment  from reading to museums  to travel  And finding himself in the middle of this excitement was an accomplished French painter named Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg  

Loutherbourg arrived in England in 1771  and immediately went to work as a set designer at the famous Drury Lane Theater in London  From his first shows  Loutherbourg showed a knack for imagination and stage design  all in the interest of creating illusions that allowed the audience to suspend disbelief completely  He accomplished this by giving the stage a greater feeling of depth  which he did by cutting up some of the rigid background scenery  and placing it at various angles and distances from the audience  Another realistic touch was using three dimensional objects on the set  like rocks and bushes as opposed to two dimensional painted scenery  He also paid much more attention to lighting and sound than had been done before  

Now  these sets were so elaborate that many people attended the theater more for them than for the actors or the story  At the time  people were wild for travel and for experiencing new places  but not everyone could afford it  Loutherbourg outdid himself  however  with a show that he set up in his own home  He called it the  Eidophusikon   

 Eidophusikon  means something like representation of nature  and that s exactly what he intended to do  create realistic moving scenes that change before the audiences  eyes  In this  he synthesized all his tricks from Drury Lane  mechanical motions  sound  light  other special effects to create  if you will  an early multimedia production  

The  Eidophusikon  was Loutherbourg s attempt to release painting from the constraints of the picture frame  After all  even the most action filled exciting painting can represent only one moment in time  and any illusion of movement is gone after the first glance  But Loutherbourg  like other contemporary painters  wanted to add the dimension of time to his paintings  You know  the popular thinking is that Loutherbourg was influenced by landscape painting  But why can t we say that the  Eidophusikon  actually influenced the painters  At the very least we have to consider that it was more     it was more of a mutual thing  We know  for example  that the important English landscape painter Thomas Gainsborough attended almost all of the early performances  and his later paintings are notable for their increased color and dynamic use of light  

Loutherbourg s influence on the theater though  he was incredibly influential  the way he brought together design and lighting and sound as a unified feature of the stage  can easily be seen in English theater s subsequent emphasis on lighting and motion  

Now  the  Eidophusikon  stage was actually a box  a few meters wide  a couple meters tall and a couple meters deep  That is  the action took place within this box  This was much smaller of course than the usual stage  But  it also allowed Loutherbourg to concentrate the lighting to better effect  Also  the audience was in the dark  which wouldn t be a common feature of the theater until a hundred years later  The show consisted of a series of scenes  for example  a view of London from sunrise that changes as the day moves on  mechanical figures  such as cattle  moved across the scene  and ships sailed along the river  

But what really got people was the attention to detail  much like his work at Drury Lane  So  for example  he painted very realistic ships  and varied their size depending on their distance from the audience  Small boats moved more quickly across the foreground than larger ones did that were closer to the horizon  Other effects  like waves  were also very convincing  They reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night  Even the colors changed as they would in nature  Sound and light were important in making his productions realistic  He used a great number of lamps  and he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass  to create effects like passing clouds that suddenly change in color  Furthermore  he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light  rather than using the uniform lighting that was common at the time  And many of the sound effects he pioneered are still in use today  like creating thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin copper sheet  

One of his most popular scenes was of a storm  And there is a story that on one occasion  an actual storm passed over head during the show  And some people went outside  and they claimed Loutherbourg s thunder was actually better than the real thunder  
 
TPO 9 Lecture 2 Environmental Science

Listen to a part of lecture in an environmental science class 

Lecturer  So since we re on the topic of global climate change and its effects  in Alaska  in the northern Arctic part of Alaska  over the last     oh    thirty years or so  temperatures have increased about half a degree Celsius per decade  and scientists have noticed that there s been a change in surface vegetation during this time  Shrubs are increasing in the  tundra   

Tundra is flat land with very little vegetation  Just a few species of plants grow there because the temperature is very cold  and there s not much precipitation  And because of the cold temperatures  the tundra has two layers  top layer  which is called the active layer  is frozen in the winter and spring  but thaws in the summer  Beneath this active layer is a second layer called  permafrost   which is frozen all year around  and is impermeable to water  

Female Student  So because of the permafrost  none of the plants that grow there can have deep roots  can they  

Lecturer  No  and that s one of the reasons that shrubs survive in the Arctic  Shrubs are little bushes  They re not tall and being low to the ground protects them from the cold and wind  And their roots don t grow very deep  so the permafrost doesn t interfere with their growth  OK  

Now since the temperatures have been increasing in Arctic Alaska  the growth of shrubs has increased  And this has presented climate scientists with a puzzle    

Male Student  I m sorry  when you say the growth of shrubs has increased  do you mean that the shrubs are bigger  or that there are more shrubs  

Lecturer  Good question  And the answer is both  The size of the shrubs has increased and shrub cover has spread to what was previously shrub free tundra  Ok  so what s the puzzle  Warmer temperatures should lead to increased vegetation growth  right  Well  the connection is not so simple  The temperature increase has occurred during the winter and spring  not during the summer  But the increase in shrubs has occurred in the summer  So how can increase temperatures in the winter and spring result in increased shrub growth in the summer  

Well  it may be biological processes that occur in the soil in the winter  that cause increased shrub growth in the summer  and here s how  there are  microbes   microscopic organisms that live in the soil  These microbes enable the soil to have more nitrogen  which plants need to live and they remain quite active during the winter  There re two reasons for this  first  they live in the active layer  which  remember  contains water that doesn t penetrate the permafrost  Second  most of the precipitation in the Arctic is in the form of snow  And the snow  which blankets the ground in the winter  actually has an insulating effect on the soil beneath it  And it allows the temperature of the soil to remain warm enough for microbes to remain active  So there s been increased nutrient production in the winter  And that s what s responsible for the growth of shrubs in the summer and their spread to new areas of the tundra  Areas with more new nutrients are the areas with the largest increase in shrubs  

Female student  But  what about run off in the spring  when the snow finally melts  Won t the nutrients get washed away  Spring thaw always washes away soil  doesn t it  

Lecturer  Well  much of the soil is usually still frozen during peak run off  And the nutrients are deep down in the active layer anyway  not high up near the surface  which is the part of the active layer most affected by run off  

But as I was about to say  there s more to the story  The tundra is windy  and the snow is blown across the tundra  it s caught by shrubs  And deep snow drifts often form around shrubs  And we ve already mentioned the insulating effect of snow  So that extra warmth means even more microbial activity  which means even more food for the shrubs  which means even more shrubs and more snow around etc   It s a circle  a loop  And because of this loop  which is promoted by warmer temperatures in winter and spring  well  it looks like the tundra may be turning into shrub land  

Female student  But will it be long term  I mean maybe the shrubs will be abundant for a few years  and then it ll change back to tundra  

Lecturer  Well  shrub expansion has occurred in other environments  like semiarid grassland  and tall grass prairies  And shrub expansion in these environments does seem to persist  almost to the point of causing a shift  Once is established  shrub land thrives  particularly in the Arctic  because Arctic shrubs are good at taking advantage of increased nutrients in the soil  better than other Arctic plants

S  Well  I received a letter in my mailbox saying that I m supposed to return a book that I checked out back in January  it s call  Modern Social Problems   But because I m writing my senior thesis  I m supposed to be able to keep the book all semester 

L  So you signed up for extended borrowing privileges 

S  Yeah 

L  But we are still asking you to bring the book back 

S  Uh huh 

L  Well  let me take a look and see what the computer says  The title was
 Modern Social Problems   

S  Yeah 

L  OK  Um    Oh  I see  it s been recalled  You can keep it all semester as long as no one else requests it  But  someone else has  It looks like one of the professors in the sociology department has requested it  So you have to bring it back  even though you ve got extended borrowing privileges  You can check out the book again when it s returned in a couple of weeks 

S  But I really need this book right now 

L  Do you need all of it or is there a certain section or chapter you re working with 

S  I guess there is one particular chapter I ve been using lately for a section of my thesis  Why 

L  Well  you can photocopy up to one chapter of the book  Why don t you do that for the chapter you re working on right now  And by the time you need the rest of the book  maybe it will have been returned  We can even do the photocopying for you because of the circumstances 

S  Oh  well  that would be great 

L  I see you ve got some books there  Is that the one you were asked to return 

S  No  I left it in my dorm room  These are books I need to check out today  Is it Ok if I bring that one by in a couple of days 

L  Actually  you need to return it today  That is if you want to check out those books today  That s our policy 

S  Oh  I didn t know that 

L  Yeah  not a lot of people realize that  In fact  every semester we get a few students who have their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven t returned books  They re allowed to use books only in the library  They re not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books  

S  That s not good  I guess I should head back down to the dorm right now then 

L  But  before you go  what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks  You don t want to waste any time getting it back 

S  Thanks a lot  Now I don t feel quite so bad about having to return the book 

 
TPO 9 Lecture 3 Geology

Lecturer  So  continuing our discussion of desert lakes  now I want to focus on what s known as the  Empty Quarter   The  Empty Quarter  is a huge area of sand that covers about a quarter of the Arabian Peninsula  Today it s pretty desolate  barren and extremely hot  But there ve been times in the past when monsoon rains soaked the Empty Quarter and turned it from a desert into grassland that was dotted with lakes and home to various animals  There were actually two periods of rain and lake formation  the first one began about 37 000 years ago  and the second one dates from about 10 000 years ago 

Female Student  Excuse me  Professor  But I m confused  Why would lakes form in the desert  It s just sand  after all 

Lecturer  Good question  We know from modern day desert lakes  like Lake Eyre in South Australia  that under the right conditions  lakes do form in the desert  But the Empty Quarter lakes disappeared thousands of years ago  They left behind their beds or basins as limestone formations that we can still see today  They look like low lying  white or grey buttes  long  narrow hills with flat tops  barely a meter high  

A recent study of some of the formations presents some new theories about the area s past  Keep in mind though that this study only looked at 19 formations  And about a thousand have been documented  So there s a lot more work to be done  

According to the study  two factors were important for lake formation in the Empty Quarter  first the rains that fell there were torrential  So it would ve been impossible for all the water to soak into the ground  Second  as you know  sand dunes contain other types of particles  besides sand  including clay and silt  Now  when the rain fell  water ran down the sides of the dunes  carrying clay and silt particles with it  And wherever these particles settled  they formed a pan  a layer that water couldn t penetrate  Once this pan formed  further run off collected  and formed a lake 

Now  the older lakes  about half the formations  the ones that started forming 37000 years ago  the limestone formations we see  they re up to a kilometer long  but only a few meters wide  and they re scattered along the desert floor  in valleys between the dunes  So  the theory is  the lakes formed there on the desert floor  in these long narrow valleys  And we know  because of what we know about similar ancient desert lakes  we know that the lakes didn t last very long  from a few months to a few years on average  As for the more recent lakes  the ones from 10000 years ago  well  they seemed to have been smaller  and so may have dried up more quickly  

Another difference  very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones  is the location of the limestone formations  The more recent beds are high up in the dunes  

Why these differences  Well  there are some ideas about that  and they have to do with the shapes of the sand dunes  when the lakes were formed  37000 years ago  the dunes were probably nicely rounded at the top  so the water just ran right down their sides to the desert floor  But there were thousands of years of wind between the two rainy periods  reshaping the dunes  So  during the second rainy period  the dunes were kind of chopped up at the top  full of hollows and ridges  and these hollows would ve captured the rain right there on the top 

Now  in a grassland of Lake Ecosystem  we d expect to find fossils from a variety of animals  and numerous fossils have been found at least at these particular sites  But  where did these animals come from  Well  the theory that has been suggested is that they migrated in from nearby habitats where they were already living  Then as the lakes dried up  they died out  

The study makes a couple of interesting points about the fossils  which I hope will be looked at in future studies  At older lake sites  there s fossil remains from hippopotamuses  water buffalo  animals that spend much of their lives standing in water  and also  fossils of cattle  However  at the sites of the more recent lakes  there  s only cattle fossils  additional evidence for geologists that these lakes were probably smaller  shallower  because cattle only use water for drinking  So they survive on much less  Interestingly  there are clams and snail shells  but  no fossils of fish  We re not sure why  Maybe there was a problem with the water  Maybe it was too salty  That s certainly true of other desert lakes 

 
TPO 9 Lecture 4 Linguistic

Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class  The professor has been discussing Animal communication systems 

L  OK  so last time  we covered the dances honey bees do to indicate where food can be found and the calls and songs of different types of birds  Today  I d like to look at some communication systems found in mammals  particularly in primates  such as orangutans  chimpanzees  gorillas    Yes  Thomas 

T  Excuse me  Professor  But when you talk about gorilla language  do you mean like  those experiments where humans taught them sign language or a language like   

L  OK  wait just a minute  Now  who in this class heard me use the word  language   No one I hope  What we re talking about here  are systems of communication  all right 

T  Oh  sorry  communication  right  But could you maybe  like  clarify what the difference is 

L  Of course  that s a fair question  OK  well  to start with  let s make it clear that language is a type of communication  not the other way around  OK  so all communication systems  language included  have certain features in common 
For example  the signals used to communicate from the bee s dance movements  to the word and sentences found in human languages  All these signals convey meaning  And all communication systems serve a purpose  a pragmatic function of some sort  Warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information  

But there re several features peculiar to human language that have  for the most part  never been found in the communication system of any other species  

For one thing  learn ability  Animals have instinctive communication systems  When a dog  a puppy gets to certain age  it s able to bark  It barks without having to learn how from other dogs  it just barks  But much of human language has to be learned from other humans  

What else makes human language unique  What makes it different from animal communication  Deborah 

D  How about grammar  Like having verbs  nouns  adjectives 

L  OK  that s another feature  And it s a good example   

D  I mean I mention this  cause like in my biology class last year  I kind of remember talking about a study on prairie dogs  where  I think the researchers claimed that the warning cries of prairie dogs constitute language  because they have these different parts of speech  You know  like nouns  to name the type of predator they spotted  adjectives to describe its size and shape  verbs     but now it seems like   

L  All right  hold on a moment  I m familiar with the study you re talking about  And for those of you who don t know  prairie dogs are not actually dogs  They re a type of rodent who  who burrow in the ground in the grasslands of the western United States and Mexico  

In this study  the researchers looked at the high pitched barks a prairie dog makes when it spots predator  And from this they made some pretty    well  they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language  with its own primitive grammar  But actually  these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys  And  well  let s not even get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal communication  

Another thing that distinguishes a real language is a property we call  discreteness   In other words  messages are built up out of smaller parts  sentences out of words  words out of individual sounds  etc  Now maybe you could say that the prairie dog s message is built from smaller parts  like say for example  our prairie dog spots a predator  a big coyote approaching rapidly  So the prairie dog makes a call that means  coyote   then one that means  large   and then another one to indicate its speed  But do you really suppose it makes any difference what order these calls come in  No  

But the discrete units that make up language can be put together in different ways  Those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages  including messages that are completely novel  that have never been expressed before  For example  we can differentiate between   A large coyote moves fast   and say  Move the large coyote fast   or  Move fast  large coyote    and I truly doubt whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before  

Human language is productive  an open ended communication system  whereas no other communication system has this property  

And another feature of language that s not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call  displacement   That is  language is abstract enough that we can talk about things that aren t present here and now  Things like  My friend Joe is not in the room   or  It will probably rain next Thursday   Prairie dogs may be able to tell you about a hawk that s circling overhead right now  but they never show any inclination to describe the one they saw last week

OK  hold on  slow down  Um…these are questions that  well  just about every young artist has to struggle with  OK  the first thing you should do is you absolutely have to stay true to your artistic vision  take the pictures you want to take  
Don t start trying to catch the flavor the month and be trendy because you think you ll get into a show    that never works  because you wind up creating something you don t really believe in  It s uninspired  and won t make any shows  I ve seen it happen so many times  This doesn t mean that you should go into a cave  Keep up with trends  even think about how your work might fit in with them  but don t mindlessly follow them 

Student
Well  yeah  I can see that  I think though I have always been able to stay pretty true to what I want to create  not what others want me to create  I think that comes through in my work 

Professor
OK  just remember that is one thing to create work that you really want to create when it s in the classroom  The only thing at stake is your grade  But work created outside the classroom  That can be in different story  I m not talking about technique or things like that  It s just that there is so much more at stake when you are out there making art for a living  There s a lot of pressure to become something you are not  and people often surrender to that pressure 

Student
But to get stuff exhibited…

Professor
Well  you need to be a bit of an opportunist  You know  common sense things like always having a sample of your work on hand to give to people  You won t believe the kind of contacts and opportunities you can get in this way  And try to get your work seen in the places like restaurants  bookstores  you d be surprised how word gets around about photography in places like that 
Student
OK it s just so hard to think about all of those practical things and make good work  you know 

 
TPO 10 Lecture 1 Marine Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Marine Biology Class

Professor
We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures  So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers  Because until recently there was no fossil record of what we call  the missing link   that is evidence of species that show the transition between land dwelling mammals and today s whales  Fortunately  some recent fossil discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer  

For example  a few years back in Pakistan  they found the skull of a wolf like creature  It was about 50 million years old  Scientists had seen this wolf like creature before  but this skull was different  The ear area of the skull had characteristics seen only in aquatic mammals  specifically whales 

Uh  well  then also in Pakistan they found a fossil of another creature  which we call Ambulocetus Natans  That s a mouthful  eh  The name Ambulocetus natans comes from Latin of course  and means  walking whale that swims   It clearly had four limbs that could have been used for walking  It also had a long thin tail  typical of mammals  something we don t see in today s whales  But  it also had a long skeletal structure  And that long skeletal structure suggests that it was aquatic  

And very recently in Egypt  they found a skeleton of Basilosaurus  Basilosaurus was a creature that we ve already known about for over a hundred years  And it has been linked to modern whales because of its long whale like body  But this new fossil find showed a full set of leg bones  something we didn t have before  The legs were too small to be useful  They weren t even connected to its pelvis and couldn t have supported its weight  But it clearly shows Basilosaurus s evolution from land creatures  So that s a giant step in the right direction  Even better  it establishes Ambulocetus natans as a clear link between the wolf like creature and Basilosaurus  

Now these discoveries don t completely solve the mystery  I mean  Ambulocetus is a mammal that shows a sort of bridge between walking on land and swimming  But it also is very different from the whales who know today  So really we are working just a few pieces of a big puzzle 

Um…a related debate involved some recent DNA studies  Remember  DNA is the genetic code for any organism  And when the DNA from two different species is similar  it suggests that those two species are related  And when we compared some whale DNA with DNA from some other species  we got quite a surprise  The DNA suggests that whales are descendants of the hippopotamus  Yes  the hippopotamus  Well  it came as a bit of a shock  I mean  that a four legged land and river dweller could be the evolutionary source of a completely aquatic creature up to 25 times its size  Unfortunately this revelation about the hippopotamus apparently contradicts the fossil record  which suggests that the hippopotamus is only a very distant relative of the whale  not an ancestor  And of course as I mentioned  that whales are descended not from hippos but from that distant wolf like creatures  

So we have contradictory evidence  And more research might just raise more questions and create more controversies  At any rate  we have a choice  We can believe the molecular data  the DNA  or we can believe the skeleton trail  but unfortunately  not both 

Um… and there have been some other interesting findings from DNA research  For a long time  we assumed that all whales that had teeth including sperm whales and killer whales were closely related to one another  And the same for the toothless whales  like the blue whale and other baleen whales  we assumed that they be closely related  But recent DNA studies suggest that that s not the case at all  The sperm whale is actually closely related to the baleen whale  and it s only distantly related to the toothed whales  So that was a real surprise to all of us 

 
TPO10 Lecture 2 European History

Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in a European History Class 

Professor
So would it surprise you to learn that many of the foods that we today consider traditional European dishes that their key ingredients were not even known in Europe until quite recently  until the European started trading with the native peoples of North and South America  I mean  you are probably aware that the Americas provide Europe and Asia with foods like squash  beans  turkey  peanuts  But what about all those Italian tomato sauces  Hungarian goulash or my favorite  French fries  Those yummy fried potatoes 

Student
Wait  I mean I knew potatoes were from where  South America 

Professor 
South America  Right  the Andes Mountains 

Student
But you are saying tomatoes too  I just assume since they re used in so many Italian dishes 

Professor
No  like potatoes  Tomatoes grew wild in the Andes  Although unlike potatoes  they weren t originally cultivated there  That seems to have occurred first in Central America  And even then the tomato doesn t appear to have been very important as a food plant until the Europeans came on the scene  They took it back to Europe with them around 1550  And Italy was indeed the first place where it was widely grown as a food crop  So in a sense  it really is more Italian than American  

And another thing and this is true of both potato and tomato  Both of these plants are members of the Nightshade family  The Nightshade family is a category of plants which also includes many that you wouldn t want to eat  like mandrake  belladonna  and even tobacco  So it s no wonder that people once considered potatoes and tomatoes to be inedible too  even poisonous  And in fact  the leaves of the potato plant are quite toxic  So it took both plants quite a while to catch on in Europe  And even longer before they made the return trip to North America and became popular food items here 

Student
Yeah  you know  I remember  I remember my grandmother telling me that when her mother was a little girl  a lot of people still thought that tomatoes are poisonous 

Professor
Oh  sure  People didn t really start eating them here until the mid eighteen hundreds 

Student
But seems like I heard    didn t Thomas Jefferson grow them or something 

Professor
Well  that s true  But then Jefferson is known not only as the third president of the United States but also as a scholar who was way ahead of his time in many ways  He didn t let the conventional thinking of his day restrain his ideas 

Now  potatoes went through a similar sort of    uh    of a rejection process  especially when they were first introduced in Europe  You know how potatoes can turn green if they are left in the light too long  And that greenish skin can make the potatoes tastes bitter  even make you ill  So that was enough to put people off for over 200 years  Yes  Bill 

Student
I m sorry professor Jones  But I mean yeah ok  American crops have probably contributed a lot to European cooking over the years  But…

Professor
But have they really played any kind of important role in European history  Well  as a matter of fact  yes  I was just coming to that  

Let s start with North American corn or maize  as it s often called  Now before the Europeans made contact with the Americas  
they subsisted mainly on grains  grains that often suffered from crop failures  And largely for this reason that political power in Europe was centered for centuries in the South  around the Mediterranean Sea  which was where they could grow these grains with more reliability  

But
when corn came to Europe from Mexico  well  now they had a much hardier crop that could be grown easily in more northerly climates and the centers of power began to shift accordingly  And then  well  as I said potatoes weren t really popular at first  But when they finally did catch on which they did first in Ireland around 1780  Well  why do you suppose it happen  Because potatoes have the ability to provide an abundant and extremely nutritious food crop  no other crop grew in North Europe at the time had anything like the number of vitamins contained in potatoes  Plus  potatoes grown on the single acre of land could feed many more people than say  wheat grown on the same land  Potatoes soon spread to France and other Northern European countries  And as a result  the nutrition of the general population improved tremendously and population soared in the early 1800s and so the shift of power from southern to northern Europe continued

Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the University bookstore 

Student
Hi  I bought this book at the beginning of the semester  but  some thing s come up and… I d like to return it 

Employee
Well  for a full refund  store policy is that you have to return merchandise 2 weeks from the time it was purchased  Uh    but for assigned textbooks or anything having to do with specific courses  Wait    was it for a specific course 

Student
Yeah  but actually…

Employee
Well    for course books  the deadline is 4 weeks after the beginning of the semester  So this for this fall semester  the deadline was October  1st 

Student
Ouch  then I missed it  But  why October 1st 

Employee
Well  I guess the reasoning is the by October  1st  the semester is in full gear  And everyone kind of knows what courses they ll be taking that semester

Student
I get it  so it s mainly for people who decide to withdraw from… to change to new courses early on 

Employee
Exactly    The book has to been in perfect condition of course  They can t be marked up or looked use in any way for the full refund  I mean 

Student
Well  but  see  my situation is a little different  I hope you might be able to make an
exception 

Employee
Well  the policies are generally pretty rigid and the semester is almost over 

Student
Okay  Here s what happened  Um~ I think my professor really miscalculated  Anyway the syllabus was way too ambitious in my opinion  There re only 2 weeks of classes left in the semester and there are like 6 books on the syllabus that we haven t even touched 

Employee
I see  So you were hoping to return this one 

Student
Yeah  the professor already announced that we won t be reading this one by Jane Bowles and all the others I bought used

Employee
Jane Bowles  Which book of hers 

Student
It called  Two serious ladies 

Employee
Oh  but you should keep that one  Are you interested in literature 

Student
Well  I am an English major 

Employee
You are lucky to have a professor who includes a lesser known writer like her on the syllabus  you know  not the usual authors we ve all read 

Student
So you really think   

Employee
I do  And especially if you re into literature

Student
Hmm    well  this I wasn t expecting  I mean…uh   Wow 

Employee
I hope you don t think I am being pushy  If you prefer  you can return the book and arrange for a store credit  you don t qualify for a refund  Policy is policy after all  but you can make an exchange and you can use the credit for your books for next semester  The credit carries over for one semester to the next 
Student
Hmm…that s good to know  but now I am really intrigued  I guess that just because we ran out of time to read this book in class  doesn t mean that I can  t read it on my own time  You know  I think I ll give it a try 

 
TPO10 Lecture 3 Ecology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Ecology Class 

Professor
So we ve been talking about nutrients  the elements in the environment that are essential for living organisms to develop  live a healthy life and reproduce  Some nutrients are quite scarce  there just isn t much of them in the environment  But fortunately they get recycled  When nutrients are used over and over in the environment  we call that a nutrient cycle  Because of the importance of nutrients and their scarcity  nutrient recycling is one of the most significant eco system processes that we ll cover in this course  The three most important nutrient recycles are the nitrogen cycle  the carbon cycle and the one we are going to talk about today  the Phosphorus cycle 

So the Phosphorus cycle has been studied a lot by ecologists because like I said  Phosphorus is an important nutrient and it s not so abundant  The largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean  

How does Phosphorus get there  Well  let s start with the Phosphorus in rocks  The rocks get broken down into smaller and smaller particles as they are weathered  They are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time  Phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets spread around into the soil  Once it s in the soil  plants absorb it through their roots 

Student
So that s the reason people mine rocks that contain a lot of Phosphorus to help with agriculture 

Professor
Uh huh  they mined the rock  artificially break it down and put the Phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers  So humans can play a role in the first part of the Phosphorus cycle    the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs  You see  

Now after the Phosphorus is in the soil  plants grow  They use Phosphorus from the soil to grow  And when they die  they decompose  And the Phosphorus is recycled back into the soil  same thing with the animals that eat those plants  or eat other animals that have eaten those plants  We call all of this – the land phase of the Phosphorus cycle  But a lot of the Phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and melting snow  And so begins another phase of the cycle  Can anyone guess what it is called  Nancy 

Nancy
Well  if the one is called the land phase  then this has to be called the water phase  right 

Professor
Yes  that s such a difficult point isn t it  In a normal water phase  rivers eventually empty into oceans  and once in the oceans  the Phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like algae  Then fish eats the algae or eat other fish that have eaten those plants  

But the water phase is sometime affected by excessive fertilizers  If not all of Phosphorus gets used by the crops and large amounts of Phosphorus gets into the rivers  This could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river  which can lead to the water ways getting clogged with organisms  which can change the flow of the water  Several current studies are looking at these effects and I really do hope we can find a way to deal with this issue before these ecosystems are adversely affected  Ok  

Of course  another way that humans can interrupt the normal process is fishing  The fishing industry helps bring Phosphorus back to land  In the normal water phase the remaining Phosphorus makes its way  settles to the bottom of the ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments  But remember  this is a cycle  The Phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to somehow make its way back to the surface  to complete the cycle  to begin the cycle all over again  

After millions of years  powerful geological forces  like underwater volcanoes lift up the ocean sediments to form new land  When an underwater volcano pushes submerged rock to the surface  a new island is created  Then over many more years the Phosphorus rich rocks of the new land begin to erode and the cycle continues 

Guy
What about  well  you said that the nitrogen cycle is also an important nutrient cycle  And there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere  so I was wondering  is there a lot of Phosphorus in the atmosphere too 

Professor
Good question  George  You re right to guess that Phosphorus can end up in Earth s atmosphere  It can move from the land or from the oceans to the atmosphere  and vice versa  However  there s just not a substantial amount of it there  like there is with nitrogen  it s a very minimal quantity 

 
TPO10 Lecture 4 Psychology

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a Psychology Class 

Professor
OK  If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember  I ll bet for most of you  your earliest memory would be from about age 3  right  Well  that s true for most adults  We can t remember anything that happened before the age of 3  And this phenomenon is so widespread and well documented it has a name  It is called childhood amnesia and was first documented in 1893 

As I said  this phenomenon refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents  It s not children trying to remember events from last month or last year  Of course it follows that if you can t remember an incident as a child  you probably won t remember it as an adult  OK 

So …so    so why is this  What are the reasons for childhood amnesia  
Well  once a popular explanation was that childhood memories are repressed     uh  the memories are disturbing so that as adults we keep them buried  and so we can t recall them  And this is based on…well  well  it s not based on  on  on… the kind of solid research and lab testing we want to talk about today  So let s put that explanation aside and concentrate on just two  OK  

It   it could be that as children we do form memories of things prior to age 3  but forget them as we get grow older  that s one explanation  Another possibility is that children younger than three lack   uh   lack some cognitive capacity for memory  And that idea  that children are unable to form memories  that s been the dominant belief in psychology for the past hundred years  

And this idea is very much tied to two things  the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language development in children  

So Piaget s theory of cognitive development  Piaget suggested that because they don t have language  children younger than 18 to 24 months live in the here and now  that is they lack the mean to symbolically represent objects and events  that are not physically present  Everybody get that  Piaget proposed that young children don t have a way to represent things that aren t right in front of them  That s what language does  right  Words represent things  ideas 

Once language starts to develop from about age 2  they do have a system for symbolic representation and can talk about things which aren t in their immediate environment including the past  Of course he didn t claim that infants don t have any sort of memory  it s acknowledged that they can recognize some stimuli  like faces  And for many years this model was very much in favor in psychology  even though memory tests were never performed on young children  

Well  finally in the 1980s  a study was done  And this study showed that very young children under the age of 2 do have the capacity for recall  Now  if the children can  t talk  how was recall tested  Well  that is a good question  since the capacity for recall has always been linked with the ability to talk  

So the researchers set up an experiment using imitation based tasks  Adults used props  uh  toys or other objects to demonstrate an action that had 2 steps  The children were asked to imitate the steps immediately and then again after delays of one or more month  And even after a delay  the children could…could recall or replicate the action  the objects used  the steps involved and the order of the steps  Even children as young as 9 months 

Now  tests showed that there was a faster rate of forgetting among the youngest children  but most importantly it showed that the development of recall did not depend on language development  And that was an importance finding  

I guess I should add that the findings don t say that there was no connection   no connection between the development of language and memory  There s some of evidence that being able to talk about an event does lead to having a stronger memory of that event  But that does not seem to be the real issue here 

So  back to our question about the cause of childhood amnesia  well  there is something called the rate of forgetting  And childhood amnesia may reflect a high rate of forgetting  in other words  children under the age of 3 do form memories and do so without language  But they forget the memories at a fast rate  probably faster than adults do  Researchers have set a standard… sort of an expected rate of forgetting  but that expected rate was set based on the tests done on adults  So what is the rate of forgetting for children under the age of 3  We expect it to be high  but the tests to prove this really haven t been done yet

Hi  I need to pick up a gym pass  

Employee
OK  I ll need your name  year  and university ID 

Student
Here s my ID card  And my name is Gina Kent  and I m first year 

Employee
OK  Gina  I ll type up a pass for you right away 

Student
Great  This is exciting  I can t wait to get started 

Employee
Oh  this is a wonderful gym 

Student
That s what everybody has been saying  Everyone is talking about the new
pool and the new indoor courts  But what I love is all the classes 

Employee
The classes… 

Student
Yes  like the swimming and tennis classes and everything 

Employee
Oh yeah  but this pass doesn t entitle you to those 

Student
It doesn t 

Employee
No  the classes fall into a separate category 

Student
But  that s my whole reason for getting a pass  I mean  I was planning to take a
swimming class 

Employee 
But that s not how it works  This pass gives you access to the gym and to all the equipment  and to the pool and so forth  But not when the teams are practicing  so you ll have to check the schedule 

Student
But what do I have to do if I want to take a class 

Employee
You have to  one  register  and two  pay the fee for the class 

Student
But that s not fair 

Employee
Well  I think if you think about it  You ll see that it s fair 

Student
But people who play sports in the gym… they don t have to pay anything 

Employee
Yes  but they just come in  and play or swim on their own  But  taking a class   that is a different story  I mean  someone has to pay the instructors 

Student
So  if I want to enroll in a class    

Employee
Then you have to pay extra  The fee isn t very high  but there s a fee  So  what class did you say you want to take 

Student
Swimming…

Employee
OK  Swimming classes are thirty dollars a semester 

Student
I guess I could swing that  But I m still not convinced it s fair  So  do I pay you 

Employee 
Well  first  you need to talk to the instructor  They have to assess your level and steer you to the right class  you know  beginner  intermediate…

Student
You mean  I have to swim for them  Show them what I can do 

Employee
No  no  you just tell them a little bit about your experience and skill  so they
know what level you should be in 

Student
Oh  OK  So  I guess I ll need an appointment 

Employee
And I can make that for you right now  And then I ll type up your gym ID card  You ll need it to get into the building  Now about that appointment… how does Wednesday at three sound 

Student
Fine…

Employee
OK  And you ll be meeting with Mark Gettys  He s the swimming instructor  He
also coaches the swim team  And here  I ve jotted it all down for you 

Student
Great  Thanks 

 
TPO11 Lecture 1 Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology Class  The class has been learning
about birds  

Professor
Ok  today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors
of birds  And we are going to start by talking about what are known as
distraction displays  

Now if you are a bird and there is a predator around 
What are you going to do  Well  for one thing you are going to try to attract as little attention as possible  right  Because if the predator doesn t know you are there  it is not going to try to eat you  But sometimes certain species of birds do the exact opposite  When a predator approaches  they do their best to attract the attention of that predator  

Now why would they do that  Well  they
do that to draw the predator away from their nest  away from their eggs or their young birds  And the behaviors that the birds engage in to distract predators are called distraction displays  And there are a number of different kinds of distraction displays  

Most of the time  when birds are engaging in distraction displays  they are going to be pretending either that they have an injury or that they re ill or that they re exhausted  You know something that ll make the predator think  Ah… here is an easy meal  

One pretty common
distraction display is what s called the broken wing display  And in a broken wing display  the bird spreads and drags a wings or its tail  and while it does that  it slowly moves away from the nests  So it really looks like a bird with a broken wing  And these broken wing displays can be pretty convincing 

Another version of this kind of distraction display is where the bird creates the impression of a mouse or some other small animals that s running along the ground  A good example of that kind of display is created by a bird called the purple sandpiper  

Now what s the purple sandpiper does is when a predator approaches  it drags its wings but not to give the impression that its wing is broken but to create the illusion that it has a second pair of legs  And then it raises its feathers  so it looks like it s got a coat of fur  And then it runs along the ground swerving left and right  you know like it s running around little rocks and sticks  And as it goes along  it makes this little squealing noise  So from a distance it really looks and sounds like a little animal running along the ground trying to get away  Again to the predator  it looks like an easy meal 

Now what s interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these distraction displays  They don t give their top performance  their prime time performance every time  What they do is they save their best performances  their most conspicuous and most risky displays for the time just before the baby birds become able to take care of themselves  And they time it that way because that s when they ll have made the greatest investment in parenting their young  So they are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs  because they haven t invested that much time or energy in parenting yet  The top performances are going to come later  

Now you have some birds that are quiet mature  are quite capable almost as soon as they hatch  In that case  the parent will put on the most conspicuous distraction displays just before the babies hatch  because once the babies are hatched  they can pretty much take care of themselves  And then you have others birds that are helpless when they hatch  In that case  the parent will save its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers 

 
TPO11 Lecture 2 Architecture

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Architecture Class 

Professor
Today  we are taking a little detour from the grand styles of public architecture we ve been studying to look at residential architectures in the United States  Since this is something we can all identify with  I think it will help us see the relationship between the function of a structure and its style or form  This has been an ongoing theme in our discussions  and we will be getting back to it in just a moment  But before we get started  I want you to take a moment to think  does anyone know what the single most popular style for a house in the United States is today  Bob 

Student 1
 I bet it is the ranch style house  

Professor
 Well  in this area  probably  But are we typical  Yes  Sue  

Student 2
 How about the kind of house my grandparents live in  They call it a Cape
Cod 

Professor
That s the one  Here is a drawing of what we consider of a classic Cape Cod house  These days  you see this style all over the United States  But it first showed up in U S  northeast  in the New England region  around the late 1600s  For those of you who don t know the northeast coastal region  Cape Cod is a peninsula  a narrow strip of land that jets out into the Atlantic  and so     so  many houses in this particular style were built on Cape Cod  that the name of the place became the name of the style  

Now why did the Cape Cod style house become so popular in the northeast  Well  one reason is that it s a great example of form following function  We ve talked about this design principle a lot about form following function  And what did we say it meant  Someone give me an application of this principle  What is this concept that form should follow function  How would it be applied to housing design 

Student 2
Well  if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it  Then  well  the architect has to be very practical to think about the people who ll actually be living in the house or working in the office building  whatever  so for the architect  it s all about the users not about showing off how creative you can be 

Professor
Good  of course  for a Cape Cod house  it might be even more accurate to say that form also follows climate  Who knows what the climate s like on Cape Cod 

Student 1
Cold in the winter…

Student 2
And whenever I visit my grandparents  it s really wet  It s usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy  too  I guess because it s so exposed to the ocean 

Professor
That s right  So take another look at this drawing  and you can imagine how this design might be particularly helpful in that kind of climate  Notice how the house sits fairly low to the ground  This relatively low compact structure helps the house withstand the strong winds blowing off the ocean  

And look at the
slope of the roof  the steep angle helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter  

Another thing  Cape Cod houses usually face south to take advantage of the sun s warm through the windows  That s helpful in winter  

Now what can you tell me about the chimney  about its location 

Student 2
Well  it s in the middle  Because  does that have something to do with heating the houses  I mean since the heat never has to travel very far 

Student 1
That d mean you can heat the house more efficiently  right 

Professor
Exactly  now see how the house has very little exterior decoration  that s also typical of early Cape Cod houses  The wind was one reason  nothing sticking out that might blow away in the harsh weather  but there was probably another reason  not related to the climate  more a reflection of rural New England society back then  you see Cape Cod houses were not built in the big cities  where all the rich people lived back then  These were modest dwellings  the people who built them simply couldn t afford lots of expensive decorative details  But it was more than just a matter of money  In these rural areas  people depended on each other for survival  Neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment  so you didn t want to appear to be showing off  You d want to avoid anything that might set you apart from your neighbors  the same people you might need to help you someday  So all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the community  and you can see why a modest  a very plain style would have become so widely imitated throughout rural New England 

Student 2
It is plain  but you know its nice looking 

Professor
Good point  and in fact it s precisely that aesthetic appeal  the…the purity  the nearly perfect proportions of the house…that s another reason for the Cape Cod s enduring popularity  even in places where the climate is so mild that its functional design doesn t matter

Professor
No  not at all  in fact it s very good  That s why I wanted to talk to you 

Student
Oh  thanks

Professor
I think you know the department is looking to hire a new professor  are you familiar with our hiring process 

Student
No  but what is that got to do with me 

Professor
Well  Bill  we have several qualified applicants we are serious about  And as part of the interview process  we have them meet with a committee of professors and students in our department  They also have to give a talk  

Student
You mean like a lecture 

Professor
Yes  like a sample lecture on one of their academic interests

Student
Oh  so you can see their teaching style 

Professor
Exactly

Student
Uh huh …Make sense 

Professor
So I d like to know if you d be willing to join us as a student representatives on the interview committee  It d be a good experience for you  You could put it on your resume 

Student
Oh… that d look good for my grad school application  I guess  so  what do I
have to do

The department secretary will give you a schedule of the applicants  visits  If you are free  we d like you to attend their talks and then later you can give us your opinion  Oh  and we usually serve lunch or snacks depending on what time the talk is 

Student
Cool  that s another good reason to do this  Um… when is the next talk 

Professor
We actually haven t had any yet  the first one is next Friday  at 10 AM  then lunch  and then formal discussion with the applicant right after 

Student
Oh well  I m free on Fridays  If all the talks are on Fridays  I will be able to make it to all of them  

Professor
That s great  now you should know that this job candidate is interested in the life cycles in the forest 

Student
That s what my research about 

Professor
Yes  I know that s why I feel it necessary to point out that even though this applicant s research interests are similar to yours  we want you to tell us what you think about the teaching of all these applicants  Your perspective as a student  how the applicant teaches in the classroom  that what s important to us 

Student
I understand  So how many applicants are there 

Professor
Let s see  we have 4  all very good candidates  that we will be looking at over the next few weeks  It s going to be a tough decision  But it ll be a good experience for you  especially if you re going to grad school 

Student
Thank you  It ll be cool to do this  I ll get a copy of the schedule from the secretary on my way out 

Professor
You re welcome  see you in class this afternoon

 
TPO11 Lecture 3 Environmental science

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class  

Professor
When land gets developed for human use  the landscape changes  We don t see as many types of vegetation  trees  grasses and so forth  This in turn leads to other losses  the loss of animals that once lived there  Err…but these are the obvious changes  but there are also less obvious changes like the climate  One interesting case of this…uh…of changes in the local land use causing changes in climate  specifically the temperature is in Florida  Now what comes to mind when you think of the state of Florida 

Student A
Sunshine  beaches 

Student B
Warm weather  oranges…

Professor
Yes  exactly  Florida has long had a great citrus industry  large growth of oranges  lemons and the like  Florida s winter is very mild  the temperature doesn t often get below freezing  But there are some areas of Florida that do freeze  So in the early 1900s  farmers moved even further south in Florida  to areas that were even less likely to freeze  Obviously  freezing temperatures are a danger to the crops  A bad bout of cold weather  a long spell of frosts could ruin a farmer s entire crop  anyway  before the citrus growers moved south  much of the land in south Florida  was what we called wetlands  Wetlands are areas of marshy  swampy land  areas where water covers the soil  or is present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year  Wetlands have their own unique ecosystems  with plants and animals with special and interesting adaptations  Very exciting  but it s not what we are talking about today  Emm…where was I 

Student A
Farmers moved south 

Professor
Oh  yes  Farmers moved south  But the land was not suitable for farming  You can t grow oranges in wetlands  so farmers had to transform the wetlands into land suitable for farming  To do that  you have to drain the water from the land  move the water elsewhere  and divert the water sources such as rivers  Hundreds of miles of drainage canals were built in the wetlands  

Now these areas  the new areas the farmers moved to  used to be warm and unlikely to freeze  however  recently the area has become susceptible to freezes  And we are trying to understand why 

Student B
Is it some global temperature change or weather pattern like El Ni?o or something 

Professor
Well  there are two theories  One idea is as you suggest that major weather patterns  something like El Ni?o  are responsible  But the other idea and this is the one that I personally subscribe to  is that the changes in the temperature pattern have been brought about by the loss of the wetlands 

Student A
Well  how would loss of wetlands make a difference 

Professor
Well  think about what we ve been studying so far  We ve discussed the impact of landscapes on temperature  right  What effects does a body of water have on an area 

Student A
Oh  yeah  Bodies of water tend to absorb the heat during the day  and then they release the heat at night 

Professor
Yes  exactly  What you just said is what I want you all to understand  Bodies of water release heat and moisture back into the environment  So places near large bodies of water are generally milder  err   slightly warmer than those without water  And what I and others think is that the loss of the wetlands has created a situation where the local temperatures in the area are now slightly different  slightly colder than they were 100 years ago  before the wetlands were drained  

Student B
Hmm…do we know what the temperature was like back then 

Professor
Well  we were able to estimate this  We have data about South Florida s current landscape  uh…the plant cover  And we were able to reconstruct data about its landscape prior to 1900  Then we enter those data  information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetlands were drained  We enter the data into a computer weather model  This model can predict temperatures  And when all of the data were entered  an overall cooling trend was predicted by the model 

Student B
How much colder does it get now 

Professor
Well  actually the model shows a drop of only a few degrees Celsius  But this is enough to cause dramatic damage to crops  If temperatures overnight are already very close to the freezing point  then this drop of just a few degrees can take the temperature below freezing  And freezing causes frosts  which kill crops  These damaging frosts wouldn t happen if the wetlands were still in existence  just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequences 
 
TPO11 Lecture 4 Business

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class  

Professor
Let s get started  Um  last time we were talking about the need for advertising  Now  let s look at how you can successfully call attention to the service or product you want to sell  To succeed  you ve got to develop a systematic approach  If you don t come up with a system  um  a plan  you risk making decisions that waste money  or even drive away potential customers  

But what
does a systematic advertising plan look like  Well  it covers what we call    the  Four Ms   The  Four Ms   Market  Media  Money  Message  All are important areas to focus on when creating your advertising plan  We will look at them one by one 

The First step is to look at your Market  that s the people who might become customers  buyers of your service or product  You need to know all about your possible customers： Who are they？ What age group are they  What do they like  or dislike  How do they shop  So  you got that  A market is a group of potential customers 

Next  Media… Obviously the major media are television  radio  newspapers  magazines  um  billboards  and so forth  There are all avenues of communication  And you need to figure out  Which media you should advertise through  Which media will reach your intended audience    your market  So  you do research  trying to determine which media will reach the most potential customers for the lowest cost  For instance  if you have a product  that     oh    say teachers would like  then teachers are your market  So you ask yourself  What magazines do the majority of teachers read  What TV programs do teachers watch  Do teachers listen to much radio  At what times of the day  Say  now your research turns up two magazines that teachers read  And it also shows that the majority of teachers   say ages twenty to thirty   read the magazine about classroom activities  While most teachers older than that read the other magazine  the one about  oh  let s say  Educational Psychology   You think your product will appeal most to teachers ages twenty to thirty  so you decide to put your advertisement in their favorite magazine  the one about classroom activities  You don t waste money advertising in the  Educational Psychology  magazine  you know the one that the younger teachers generally don t read  And since you re reaching the majority of the teachers in your target age group  you re probably spending your money well  which bring us to the third M    Money 

You have an advertising budget to spend  but how do you to spend it wisely  Again  research is the key  Good research gives you facts  facts that can help you decide  well  as we already mentioned  decide the right market to target  and the best media to use  But also  When to advertise  or…or how to get the best rates  Like  maybe you re advertising Sports equipment  and you have been spending most of your budget during the holiday season when people buy gifts for each other  Now  in theory  that would seem a great time to advertise  but maybe research shows that you re wrong  that the customers who buy sports equipment tend not to give it as a holiday gift  but want to use it themselves  In that case  advertising during a different season of the year might give you better results  And  um  maybe at even lower  non holiday rates  so you actually save money  But you need to get the facts  facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that you re getting your money s worth  
OK  finally  there is your message  What you want to say about your product  Why buying it will make the customer s life easier  or safer or better somehow  Whatever the message is  make sure you get it right  

Let me give you an example of not getting it right  Ha   ha   ha    you are going to love this one  There was this Soup Shop  the soup was really tasty  but there weren t a lot of customers  The owner thought that maybe if they gave something away for free with each purchase  then more people would come buy soup  So they got some cheap socks  and they advertised to give a pair away with each bowl of soup  But  then even fewer people came to the restaurant  Well  you can imagine why  People started to associate the soup with feet  they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet  The advertising message  soup means free socks  was a bad choice  it was a waste of money  And worse  it caused the loss of customers 

Now  I want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples  not of good advertising messages  but of truly disastrous ones  Think of real examples or make some up  and talk about the reasons those messages are unsuccessful  And then we ll get back together and share

Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor 

Student
So Professor Tibbits  your notes said that you wanted to see me about my Hemingway paper  I have to say that grade wasn t what I was expecting  I thought I d done a pretty good job 

Professor
Oh  you did  But do you really want to settle for pretty good when you can do
something very good 

Student
You think it can be very good 

Professor
Absolutely 

Student
Would that mean you d…I could get a better grade 

Professor
Oh  sorry  It s not for your grade  It s…I think you could learn a lot by revising it 

Student
You mean  rewrite the whole thing  I m really swamped  There s deadlines wherever I turn and… and I don t really know how much time I could give it 

Professor
Well  it is a busy time  with spring break coming up next week  It s your call 
But I think that with a little extra effort  you can really turn this into a fine essay 

Student 
No… yeah…I mean  after I read your comments  I   I can see how it tries to do
too much 

Professor
Yeah  It s just too ambitious for the scope of the assignment 

Student
So I should cut out the historical part 

Professor
Yes  I would just stick to the topic  Anything unrelated to the use of nature imagery has no place in the paper  All that tangential material just distracts from the main argument 

Student
Yeah  I never know how much to include  You know…where to draw the line 

Professor
Tell me about it  All writers struggle with that one  But it s something you can learn  That will become more clear with practice  But I think if you just cut out the…um…

Student
The stuff about the history  but if I cut out those sections  won t it be too short 

Professor
Well  better a short well structured paper than a long paper that s poorly structured and wanders off topic 

Student
So all I have to do is delete those sections 

Professor
Well  not so fast  After you cut out those sections  you ll have to go back and revise the rest  to see how it all fits together  And of course  you ll have to revise the introduction too  to accurately describe what you do in the body of the paper  But that shouldn t be too difficult  Just remember to keep the discussion focused  Do you think you can get it to me by noon tomorrow 

Student
Wow…um…I have so much…er…but I ll try 

Professor
OK  good  Do try  But if you can t  well  shoot for after spring break  OK 
 
TPO12 Lecture 1 Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology Class 

Professor
As we learn more about the DNA in human cells and how it controls the growth and development of cells  then maybe we can explain a very important observation  that when we try to grow most human cells in a laboratory  they seem programmed to divide only a certain number of times before they die  

Now this differs with the type of cell  Some cells  like nerve cells  only divide seven to nine times in their total life  Others  like skin cells  will divide many  many more times  But finally the cells stop renewing themselves and they die  And in the cells of the human body itself  in the cells of every organ  of almost every type of tissue in the body  the same thing will happen eventually 

OK  you know that all of a person s genetic information is contained on very long pieces of DNA called Chromosomes  46 of them are in the human cells  that s 23 pairs of these Chromosomes of various lengths and sizes  

Now if you ll look at this rough drawing of one of them  one Chromosome about to divide into two  You see that it sort of looks like  well actually it s much more complex than this  but it reminds us a couple of springs linked together  two coiled up pieces of DNA  And if you stretch them out you will find they contain certain genes  certain sequences of DNA that help determine how the cells of the body will develop  When researchers look really carefully at the DNA in Chromosomes though  they were amazed  we all were  to find that only a fraction of it  maybe 20 30%  converts into meaningful genetic information  It s incredible  at least it was to me  But if you took away all the DNA that codes for genes  you still have maybe 70% of the DNA left over  That s the so called JUNK DNA  Though the word junk is used sort of tongue in cheek 

The assumption is that even if this DNA doesn t make up any of the genes  it must serve some other purpose  Anyway  if we examine these ends of these coils of DNA  we will find a sequence of DNA at each end of every human Chromosome  called a telomere  

Now a telomere is a highly repetitious and genetically meaningless sequence of DNA  what we were calling JUNK DNA  But it does have an important purpose  it is sort of like the plastic tip on each end of a shoelace  It may not help you tie your shoe but that little plastic tip keeps the rest of the shoelace  the shoe string from unraveling into weak and useless threads  Well  the telomeres at the ends of Chromosomes seem to do about the same thing    protect the genes  the genetically functional parts of the Chromosome  from being damaged  Every time the Chromosome divides  every time one cell divides into two  Pieces of the ends of the Chromosome  the telomeres  get broken off  So after each division  the telomeres get shorter and one of the things that may happen after a while is that pieces of the genes themselves get broken off the Chromosomes  So the Chromosome is now losing important genetic information and is no longer functional  But as long as the telomeres are a certain length  they keep this from happening  So it seems that  when the  by looking at the length of the telomeres on specific Chromosomes  we can actually predict pretty much how long certain cells can successfully go on dividing  

Now  there are some cells that just seem to keep on dividing regardless  which may not always be a good thing if it gets out of control 

But when we analyze these cells chemically  we find something very interesting  a chemical in them  an enzyme called telomerase  As bits of the telomere break off from the end of the Chromosome  this chemical  this telomerase can rebuild it  can help reassemble the protective DNA  the telomere that the Chromosome has lost  Someday we may be able to take any cell and keep it alive functioning and reproducing itself essentially forever through the use of telomerase  And in the future we may have virtually immortal nerve cells and immortal skin cells or whatever  because this chemical  telomerase  can keep the telomeres on the ends of Chromosomes from getting any shorter  

TPO12 Lecture 2 Business

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class

Professor
Ok  as we ve talked about a key aspect of running a successful business is knowing  um  getting a good sense of what the customer actually wants  and how they perceive your product  So with that in mind  I want to describe a very simple method of researching customer preference  and it is becoming increasingly common  it s called    MBWA    which stands for managing by wandering around  Now  MBWA  that s not the most technical sounding name you ve ever heard  but it describes the process pretty accurately  Here is how it works 

Basically  Um  the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers  and learn more about how well the business is serving their needs  and try to see what the customer experiences  because that s a great way to discover for yourself  how your product is perceived  what its strengths and weaknesses are  you know  how you can improve it    that sort of thing  You know Dortans  they make soup and canned vegetables and such  Well  the head of the company had Dortans  top executives walk around supermarkets  um  asking shoppers what they thought of Dortans  soups  and he used that data to make changes to the company s product  I mean  when Dortans of all the companies  embraces something as radical as MBWA  it really shows you how popular the theory has become  yes  Lisa 

Student A
But isn t it dangerous to base decisions on information from a small sample of people  Isn t large scale market research safer getting data on a lot of people 

Professor
That s a good question  and well I don t want to pretend that W… MBWA is some sort of  um  replacement for other methods of customer research  Now  market research data definitely can give you a good idea of  um  of the big picture  but MBWA is really useful  it kind of filling in the blanks  you know  getting a good underground sense of how your products are used  and how people need to respond to them  and Yes  the numbers of opinion you get is small so you do need to be careful  but  good business managers will tell you that the big fear they have and    and one of the most frequent problems they come across is well becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need  you know  surveys and market research stuff like that  they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day to day lives  Managing by wandering around  on the other hand  well  that gets you in there and gives you a good sense of what customers need  So     so when using combination then  MBWA and market research  well  they are powerful tools  

Oh  here is another example for you  uh  senior executives for a clothing manufacturer  It was  um  Lken  Lken jeans you know  they went and worked in a store for a few days  selling Lken s cloths  Now that gave them a very different idea about their product  they saw how people responded to it  they could go up to customers in the store and ask them questions about it  uh  yes Mike 

Student B
Well  I would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by  you know  if I m shopping  I don t know if I d want some business representative coming up to me and asking me questions  it s   It s like when I get phone calls at home from market researchers  I just hang up on them Professor Oh  well  it s certainly true that well no one likes getting calls at home from market researchers or people like that  but I will tell you something  Most customers have the exact opposite reaction when it comes to MBWA  Now  don t ask me why  because I really have no idea  but the fact is that customers tend to respond really well to MBWA  which is the key reason for its success 

In fact  the techniques of MBWA work so well  they have actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts  like politics for instance  Um  a few years back  the mayor of Baltimore  Um   I think his name was Sheaffer or something like that  Anyway  he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city  of his city  was to actually get out there in it and experience the things that they experienced  so he d ride around the city in  well  you know  in all parts of it  and he d see all the potholes  he d see how the trash was sometimes  um  not picked up off the side of the street and then he d go back to his office and he d write these memos  now they were memos to his staff about the problems he had seen  and how they needed to be fixed  you know that sort of thing  but the thing is he got all this information just by going around and seeing the different Baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them  Now he called it    smart politics  we d call it MBWA  or just  playing good customer service  
 
TPO 12 Conversation 2

Listen to a conversation between a student and a Department Secretary 

Student
Hi  Miss Hendrix 

Secretary
Hi Brad  how are you 

Student
I m fine  except I have a question about my paycheck 

Secretary
Sure  What  up 

Student
Well it s already been several weeks into the semester and my paycheck was supposed to go directly into my bank account  but there haven t been any deposits 

Secretary
That s odd  

Student
Yea  I thought graduate teaching assistants will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester 

Secretary
They are  Let s see did you complete all the forms for payroll 

Student
I filled in whatever they sent me  and I returned like at the end of
August 

Secretary
Hmm  well  you definitely should have been paid by now  At least two pay periods have passed since then 

Student
I asked the bank and they didn t know anything  Who should I talk to about this  payroll 

Secretary
I m going to contact them for you  There was a problem in processing some of the graduate student payroll paperwork   Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed  And some people s information couldn t be retrieved 

Student
Oh  But why didn t anyone let me know 

Secretary
I don t know how they work over there   cause they couldn t even figure out whose information was missing  And this isn t the first time  seems like something like this happens every semester 

Student
So how do I find out if my information was lost 

Secretary
I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you re in the system 
But you re probably not  

Student
Well  then  what will I need to do 

Secretary
Sorry but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax
them over to the payroll office 

Student
And then what… Well  what I really need to know is how long till I get some money  I m already a month behind in my bills and my tuition s due soon 

Secretary
They ll get you into the system the same day they receive your paperwork  
So if you do that tomorrow  you ll get paid next Friday 

Student
That s a long time from now  Will that paycheck include all the money I am owed 

Secretary
It should  I will double check with the payroll department 

Student
And another thing  Is there any way I could get paid sooner  I have been teaching all these weeks…

Secretary
I know it s not fair but I don t think they can do anything  all the checks are computed automatically in the system  They can t just write checks 

Student
But they are the ones that made a mistake  And they never told me 

Woman
I understand how you feel  If I were you  I d be upset too  I ll tell you what  when I call them  I will explain the situation and ask if there is any way you could be paid sooner  But I have to tell you that based on past experiences you shouldn t count on it  

Student
 Sigh  I understand thanks  I know it s  not your fault and that you re
doing everything you can 

Secretary
Well  what I CAN do is make sure that your first check for the total amount that the university owes you 

Student
That ll be great  Thank you  I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning and I will come by to see you then 
 
TPO 12 Lecture 3 Music history

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class  The professor has been
discussing Opera 

Professor
The word opera means work  actually it means works  It s the plural of the word opus from the Latin  And in Italian it refers in general to works of art  Opera Lyrica or lyric opera refers to what we think of as opera  the musical drama 

Opera was commonplace in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became commercial as a venture  And during those years  several things happened  primarily linguistic or thematic and both involving secularization 

Musical drama started in the churches  It was an educational tool  It was used primarily as a vehicle for teaching religion and was generally presented in Latin  the language of the Christian Church which had considerable influence in Italy at that time  But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages it was really only merchants  aristocrats and clergy who could deal with Latin  The vast majority of the population used their own regional vernacular in all aspects of their lives  And so in what is now Italy  operas quit being presented in Latin and started being presented in Italian  

And once that happened  the themes of the opera presentations also started to change  And musical drama moved from the church to the plaza right outside the church  And the themes again  the themes changed  And opera was no longer about teaching religion as it was about satire and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or persecution  or what have you 

Opera  as we think of it  is of course a resurrected form  It is the melodious drama of ancient Greek theater  the term  melodious drama  being shortened eventually to  melodrama  because operas frequently are melodramatic  not to say unrealistic  And the group that put the first operas together that we have today then  were  well…it was a group of men that included Galileo s father Vincenzo  and they met in Florence he and a group of friends of the count of Bardi and they formed what is called the Camerata dei Bardi  And they took classical theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance time  This…uh…this produced some of the operas that we have today 

Now what happened in the following century is very simple  Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than Italians were  And so as Italians migrated across Europe  they carried theater with them and opera specifically because it was an Italian form  

What happened is that the major divide in opera that endures today took place  The French said opera ought to reflect the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature  bearing in mind that we are talking about the golden age in French literature  And so the music was secondary  if you will  to the dramatic cadence of language  to the way the rhythm of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of course as a result instead of arias or solos  which would come to dominate Italian opera  The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or recitative in English  The lyrics were spoken  frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord 

The French said you really can t talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on mythology to give them their characters and their plots  mythology  the pastoral traditions  the novels of chivalry or the epics of chivalry out of the middle Ages  The Italians said  no this is a great historical tool and what better way to educate the public about Nero or Attila or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to  

The English appropriated opera after the French  Opera came late to England because all theaters  public theaters were closed  of course  during their civil war  And it wasn t until the restoration in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off  The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy  

So that you have this circle of musical influences  the Italians invented opera  the French adapted it  the English adopted it  the Italians took it back 

It came to America late and was considered to elitist for the general public  But Broadway musicals fulfilled a similar function for a great long while  

John Jay Chapman wrote about opera  quote   If an extraterrestrial being were to appear before us and say  what is your society like  what is this Earth thing all about  you could do worse than take that creature to an opera   End quote  Because opera does  after all  begin with a man and a woman and an emotion 
 
TPO12 Lecture 4 Environmental science

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class 

Professor
All right folks  let s continue our discussion of alternative energy sources and move on to what s probably the most well known alternative energy source    solar energy  The sun basically provides Earth with virtually unlimited source of energy everyday  but the problem has always been how do we tap this source of energy  Can anyone think of why it s so difficult to make use of solar energy 

Student A
Because it is hard to gather it 

Professor
That s exactly it  Solar energy is everywhere  but it s also quite diffused  And the thing is the dream of solar energy is not a new one  Humanity has been trying to use the sun s light as a reliable source of energy for centuries  And around the beginning of the 20th century there were actually some primitive solar water heaters on the consumer market  But they didn t sell very well  Any of you wanna guess why 

Student A
Well  there were other energy choices like oil and natural gas  right 

Professor
Yeah  And for better or for worse  we chose to go down that path as a society  When you consider economic factors  it s easy to see why  But then in the 1970s  there was an interest in solar energy again  Why do you think that happened 

Student B
Because oil and natural gas were   err   became scarce 

Professor
Well  not exactly  The amount of oil and natural gas in the Earth was still plentiful  but there were other reasons  It s a political thing really and I m gonna get into that now  So what happened in the 1970s was oil and natural gas became very expensive very quickly  and that spurred people to start looking into alternative forms of energy  solar energy probably being the most popular  But then in the 80s  this trend reversed itself when the price of oil and natural gas went down 

Alright  let s shift our focus now to some of the technologies that have been invented to overcome the problem of gathering diffused solar energy  The most basic solution is simply to carefully place windows in a building  so that the sun shines into the building and then it s absorbed and converted into heat  Can anyone think of where this is most commonly used 

Student A
Greenhouses 

Professor
Yep  greenhouses where plants are kept warm and provided with sunlight  because the walls of the building are made entirely of glass  But we do also have more complex systems that are used for space heating and they fall into two categories  passive and active heating systems 

Passive systems take advantage of the location or design of a house  For example  solar energy is gathered through large glass panels facing the sun  The heat is then stored in water filled tanks or concrete  No mechanical devices are used in passive heating systems  They operate with little or no mechanical assistance 

With active systems  on the other hand  you collect the solar energy at one location  and then you use pumps and fans to move heat from the collectors through a plumbing system to a tank  where it can be used to heat a home or to just provide hot water 

Student B
Excuse me  professor  but I ve got to ask  how can solar energy work at night or on cloudy days 

Professor
That s   Well   that is a really good question  As a matter of facts  science is still working on it  trying to find ways of enhancing energy storage techniques so that the coming of night or cloudy days really wouldn t matter  That is the biggest drawback to solar energy  The problem of what do you do in cases where the sun s light is weak or virtually non present  So the storage of solar energy  lots of solar energy  is a really important aspect 

Student A
Does that mean that solar energy can only be used on a small scale  like heating a home 

Professor
Well actually  there have been some attempts to build solar energy power plants  The world s largest solar power plant is located in Kremer Junction California  It can generate 194 megawatts of electric power  but that s just a drop in the bucket  Right now the utility companies are interested in increasing the capacity of the Kremer Junction Plant  but only time will tell if it will ever develop into a major source of power for that region  considering the economic and political factors involved

Professor 
Good afternoon  Alex  can I help you with something 

Student 
Well  I wanted to talk with you about the research project you assigned today  I um…I hope you could clarify a few things for me 

Professor 
I ll certainly try 

Student 
Ok  all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them  right 

Professor 
Ur  that s a start  but you ll need to do some research  too  Then you will write a paper that is not so much about the observations  but a synthesis of what you have observed and read 

Student 
Ok… And what about the children I am supposed to observe 

Professor 
Not children  a single child observed twice 

Student 
Oh…Ok  so I should choose a child with the permission of the child s parent of course and then observe that child a couple of times and take good notes  then 

Professor 
Actually after your first observation  you ll go back and look through your textbook or go to a library and find a few sources concerning the stage of development this particular child is in  And then  with that knowledge  you will make a second observation of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited 

Student 
Can you give me an example  

Professor 
Well  um  if you observed a four year old child  for example  my daughter is 4 years old  you might read up on Piaget s stages of cognitive development we covered those in class 

Student 
Uh huh 

Professor 
Uh  most likely  what stage would a child of that age be in 

Student 
Um… the pre operational stage 

Professor 
Exactly  if that s the case  her language use would be maturing and her memory and imagination would be developed 

Student 
So she might play pretend like she can pretend when driving her toy car across a couch that the couch is actually a bridge or something 

Professor 
That is right  In addition  her thinking would be primarily egocentric 

Student 
So she would be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs  and might not be able to see things from anyone else s perspective 

Professor 
Hmm  huh 

Student 
But what if she doesn t  I mean  what if she doesn t demonstrate those behaviors 

Professor 
That s fine  you ll note that in your paper  See  your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain stages of development with what you actually observed 

Student 
Ok  I have one more question now 

Professor 
And what s that 

Student 
Where can I find a child to observe 

Professor 
Um  I suggest you contact the education department secretary  She has a list of contacts at various schools and with certain families who are somehow connected to the university  Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects like yours 

Student 
Ok  I ll stop by the education department office this afternoon 

Professor 
And if you have any trouble or any more questions  feel free to come by during my office hours 
 
TPO 13 Lecture 1 City planning

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a city planning class 

Professor 
In the last 50 years or so  many American cities have had difficulties in maintaining a successful retail environment  Business owners in the city centers or the downtown areas have experienced some financial losses  because of a steady movement of people out of the cities and into the suburbs  In general  downtown areas  just don t have that many residential areas  not that many people live there  So what have city planners decided to do about it  Well  one way they ve come up with some ways to attract more people  to shop downtown was by creating pedestrian malls 

Now  what is a pedestrian mall  It s a pretty simple concept really  it is essentially an outdoor shopping area designed just for people on foot  And… well  unlike many other shopping malls that are built in the suburbs nowadays  these pedestrian malls are typically located in the downtown area of the city  And   oh    there are features like white sidewalks  comfortable outdoor seating and maybe even fountains  and    you know  art  There are variations on this model of course  but the common denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping space that will get people to shop in the city without needing their cars  So I am sure you can see how having an area that s off limits to automobile traffic would be ideal for a heavily populated city where  well  the streets would otherwise be bustling with noisy  unpleasant traffic congestion  

Now the
concept which originated in Europe was adopted by American city planners in the late 1950s  And since then  a number of Unites States  cities have created pedestrian malls  And many of them have been highly successful  So what have city planners learned about making these malls succeed 

Well  there are two critical factors to consider when creating a pedestrian mall    location and design  Both of which are equally important  Now let s start with the location  In choosing a specific location for a pedestrian mall  there are in fact two considerations  Proximity to potential customers  um…that s we d call a customer base and accessibility to public transportation which we will get to in just a moment  

Now  for a customer base  the most obvious example would be a large office building since the employees could theoretically go shopping after work or during their lunch hour  right  Another really good example is convention center which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to draw visitors to the city for major business conferences and events  But ideally  the pedestrian mall would be used by local residents  not just people working in the city or visiting the area  So that s where access to public transportation comes in  either    um   either the designers plan to locate the mall near a central transportation hub  like a bus terminal  a major train or subway station or they work with city officials to create sufficient parking areas  not too far from the mall  which makes sense because if people can t drive into the mall area  well  then they need to have easy access to it  OK  so that s location  but     but what about design  Well  design doesn t necessarily include things like sculptures or decorative walkways or… or even eye catching window displays  you know  art  Although I would be the first to admit those things are aesthetically appealing  however  visually pleasing sights  well  they are not a part of the pedestrian mall design that matter than most  The key consideration is a compact and convenient layout  One which allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes  so they can get to the major stores  resaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns  Now  this takes careful and creative planning 

But now what if one ingredient to this planning recipe is missing  There could quite possibly be long lasting effects  And I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in the Louisville Kentucky for instance  Now when the Louisville mall was built  oh  it had lots of visual appeal  it was attractively designed  right in the small part of downtown and it pretty much possessed all of the other design elements for success  But     uh  now  here is where my point about location comes into play  There wasn t a convention center around to     to help draw in visitors  and well  the only nearby hotel eventually closed down for that same reason  Well  you can imagine how this must have affected local and pedestrian mall business owners  Sort of what was we call a chain reaction  It wasn t until a convention center and a parking garage were built about a decade later that the mall started to be successful 
 
TPO 13 Lecture 2 Ecology

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an ecology class 

Professor 
So  continuing our discussion of ecological systems    whole systems  The main thing to keep in mind here is the interrelationships  The species in a system uh…  and even the landscape itself  they are interdependent  Let s take what you read for this week and see if we can apply this interdependence idea  Mike 

Student  
Well  um…  how about beavers    ecosystems with beavers and waterways 

Professor 
Good  good  go on 

Student 
Like  well  you can see how it s so important   cause if you go back before European settled in north America  like before the 1600s  back when native Americans were the only people living here  well  back then there were a lot of beavers  but later on  after Europeans…

Professor 
OK  wait  I see where you are heading with this  but before we go into how European settlement affected the ecosystem  tell me this    what kind of environment do beavers live in  Think about what it was like before the Europeans settlers came  we ll come back to where you were headed 

Student 
OK  well  beavers live near streams and rivers and they block up the streams and rivers with like logs and sticks and mud  You know  they build dams that really slow down the flow of the stream  So then the water backs up  and creates like a pond that floods the nearby land 

Professor 
And that creates wetlands  OK  tell me more 

Student 
Well with wetlands  it s like there is more standing water  more still water around  and that water is a lot cleaner than swiftly flowing water  because the dirt and sediment and stuff has a chance to sink to the bottom 

Professor 
More important for our discussion  wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water  For example  there are more varieties of fish  or insects  lots of frog spices  and then species that rely on those species start to live near the wetlands too 

Student 
Yes  like birds and mammals that eat the fish and insects  and you get trees and plants that begin to grow near the standing water that can t grow near the running water  Oh  and there s something about wetlands and groundwater too  
Professor  OK  good  Wetlands have a big effect on groundwater  the amount of water below the surface of the land  Think of wetlands as  Umm  like a giant sponge  the earth soaks up a lot of this water that s continually flooding the surface  which increases the amount of water below  So where there re wetlands  you get a lot of groundwater  and groundwater happens to be a big source of our own drinking water today 

Alright… So  back to the beavers  what if the beavers weren t there 

Student 
You just have a regular running stream  because there is no dam  so the ecosystem would be completely different  there would be fewer wetlands 

Professor 
Exactly  so  now let s go back to where you were headed before  Mike  You mentioned a change that occurred after Europeans came to North America 

Student 
Yeah  well  there used to be beavers all over the place  something like 200 million beavers  just in the continental United States  But when Europeans came  they started hunting the beavers for their fur  because beaver fur is really warm  and it was really popular for making hats in Europe  So the beavers were hunted a lot  over hunted  they are almost extinct by the 1800s  so… that meant fewer wetlands  less standing water 

Professor 
And what does that mean for the ecosystem  Kate 

Student 
Well if there is less standing water  then the ecosystem can t support as many species  because a lot of insects and fish and frogs can t live in running water  and then the birds and animals that eat them  lose their food supply 

Professor 
Precisely  so the beaver in this ecosystem is what we call a keystone species  The term keystone kind of explains itself  In architecture  a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together  and keeps it from collapsing  Well  that s what a keystone species does in an ecosystem  It s the crucial species that keeps the system going  Now  beaver populations are on the rise again  but there is something to think about  Consider humans as part of these ecosystems  you ve probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use  especially in the summer time  in recent years  And remember what I said about groundwater  imagine if we still have all those beavers around  all those wetlands  What would our water supply be like then 

 
TPO 13 Conversation 2
Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between a student and the language lab manager 

Student 
Hi  I m not sure  but um    is this the Carter language lab 

Manager 
Yes  it is  How can I help you 

Student 
I m taking first year Spanish this semester  Our professor says we need to come here to view a series of videos  I think it is called Spanish   Working on Your Accent  

Manager 
Yes  we have that  Um    They are on the wall behind you 

Student 
OK  So  I can just take    err     Can I take the whole series home  I think there are
three of them 

Manager 
I guess you haven t been here before 

Student 
No  no I haven t 

Manager 
Ok  well  you have to watch the videos here  You need to sign in to reserve an open room and sign out the video you need  just start with the first one in the series  each video is half an hour long 

Student 
So  it is a video library  basically 

Manager 
Yes  but unlike the library  you can t take any videos out of the lab 

Student 
OK  so how long can I use a video room for 

Manager 
You can sign up for two hours at a time 

Student 
Oh  good  so I can watch more than one video when I come up here  Is the lab pretty busy all the time  
Manager 
Well  rooms are usually full right after dinner time  but you can sign up the day before to reserve a room if you want 

Student 
Err   the day before    But  I can just stop in too  to see if there s any rooms open  right  

Manager 
Sure  stop in any time 

Student 
What about copies of the videos  Is there just one copy of each in the series 
I don t want to miss out if everyone comes in at once 

Manager 
Oh  no  we have several copies of each tape in the Spanish Accent series  We usually have multiple copies of everything for each video collection 

Student 
Super  So   how many rooms are there total in the lab 

Manager 
20  They are pretty small  So  we normally get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a video together  Actually  someone else from your class just came in and took the first Spanish video in to watch  You could probably run in there and watch it with him  Of course  you are welcome to have own room  But  sometimes students like to watch with a classmate  so they can review the material with each other afterwards  For example  if there was some content they didn t really understand 

Student 
I guess I prefer my own room  I concentrate better by myself and I don t want to miss anything  you know  and he s probably already started watching it   

Manager 
No problem  we ve got a lot of rooms open right now  When you come in  you sign your name on the list and you re assign a room number  or if you call in advance  then the attendant will tell you your room number  if you forget  just come in and take a look at the list  The videos are over there 

Student 
Great  thanks  
 
TPO 13 Lecture 3 Poetry

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a poetry class  the professor is discussing
medieval poetry 

Professor 
OK  so the two poems we are looking at today fall into the category of     uh     medieval
times  which was how long ago 

Student 
Almost a thousand years ago  right 

Professor 
Yes  that s right 

Student 
But  professor  are you sure these are poems  I mean I thought poems were shorter  these are more like long stories  I mean one of them was all about love  but the other one  the Chan…Chan…whatever it s called  the other one  well  it was all about fighting and battles  I mean can both of them be considered poems 

Professor 
Well  think back to the very beginning of this course 

Student 
Uh huh 

Professor 
Remember how we  we define poetry  In the very broadest sense  we said it s written to evoke  to make you  the audience  have some kind of the emotional experience through the use of imagery  um  some kind of predictable rhythm  And usually  but not always  there s more than one meaning implied with the words that are used 

Let s start with the Chanson poetry first  That s Chanson  Chanson poems became popular in Europe  particularly in France  and the term is actually short for a longer French phrase that translates to um     uh… songs of deeds 

Now  they were called songs of deeds because strangely enough  they were written to describe the heroic deeds or actions of warriors  the knights during conflicts  We don t know a lot about the authors  it s still contested somewhat  But we are pretty sure about who the Chanson poems were written for  That is   they were written for knights and the lords   the nobility that they served  The poems were sung  performed by a minstrel  a singer who travelled from castle to castle  singing to the local lord and his knights  Uh… well  would someone summarize the main features of the Chanson poem you read 

Student 
Well  there s a hero  a knight  who goes to battle  and he is admired for his courage  bravery and loyalty  loyalty to the lord he serves  his country and his fellow warriors in the field  He s     um    he has a  he s a skilled fighter  willing to face the most extreme dangers  sacrificial  willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country 

Professor 
Ok  now  given that the intended audience for these poems were knights and lords  What can we say about the purpose of Chanson poetry  What kinds of feelings was it meant to provoke 

Student 
I guess they must ve been really appealing to those knights and lords who were listening to them  Hearing the songs probably made them feel more patriotic  made them feel like it was a good and noble thing to serve their countries in whatever way they could 

Professor 
Good  we ve got a pretty good picture of what the Chanson hero was like  Now let s compare that to the hero in the other poem  The other poem is an example of what s called Romance Poetry  And the hero in the Romance poem was also a knight  But what made the knight in Romance Poetry different from the knight in Chanson poetry 

Well  first the purpose of the hero s actions was different  The hero in Romance Poetry is independent  purely solitary in a way  not like the Chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions  He doesn t engage in conflict to protect his lord or country  He does it for the sake of adventure  to improve himself  to show he s worthy of respect and love from his lady  He s very conscious of the particular rules of social behavior he has to live up to somehow  And all of his actions are for the purpose of proving that he is an upright  moral  well mannered  well behaved individual  You may have noticed that in Chanson poetry  there isn t much about the hero s feelings  The focus is on the actions  the deeds  But the Romance Poetry describes a lot of the inner feelings  the motivations  psychology you could say  of a knight trying to improve himself  to better himself  so that he s worthy of the love of a woman 

What explains this difference  Well  uh  digging into the historical context tells us a lot  Romance Poetry emerged a few generations after Chanson  and its roots were in geographic regions of France that were calmer  where conflict wasn t central to people s lives  More peaceful times meant there was more time for education  travel  more time for reflection  Another name for Romance Poetry that s often synonymous with it is troubadour poetry 

Troubadours were the authors of these new Romance poems  And we know a lot more about the troubadours than we do about the Chanson authors  because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems that gave pretty specific information about their social status  geographical location and a small outline of their career  These information wasn t particularly reliable because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories of great adventure or scraped together from parts of different poems  But there is enough there to squeeze or infer some facts about their social class  The political climate had settled down enough so that troubadours had the luxury of being able to spend most if not all of their time  creating  crafting or composing their love songs for their audiences  And yes these poems were also sung  many troubadours were able to make a living being full time poets which should tell you something about the value of that profession during medieval times 
 
TPO 13 Lecture 4 Astronomy

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class  

Professor 
OK  I wanna go over the different types of meteorites  and what we ve learned from them about the formation of Earth  and the solar system  Uh… the thing is what s especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from interplanetary space  but they consist of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on Earth  just in different proportions  But that makes it easier to identify something as a meteorite  as opposed to…to just a terrestrial rock  

So to talk about where meteorites come from  we need to talk about comets and asteroids  which basically   they re basically made up of debris left over from the origin of the solar system 4 6 billion years ago 

Now I m going a bit out of a order here…um…I m not going to go into any depth on comets and asteroids now  but we ll come back later and do that  For now  I ll just cover some basic info about them 

OK  comets and asteroids  It might help if you think of   remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our solar system  And how they differ in composition  The terrestrial planets  like Mars and Earth  composed largely of rocks and metals  and the large gas giants  like Jupiter  Well  the solar system also has two analogous classes of objects  smaller than planets  namely  asteroids and comets  

Relatively near the sun  in the inner solar system  between Jupiter and Mars to be precise  we ve got the asteroid belt  which contains about 90 percents of all asteroids orbiting the sun  These asteroids are…uh…like the terrestrial planets  in that they re composed mostly of rocky material and metals 

Far from the sun  in the outer solar system  beyond Jupiter s orbit  temperatures are low enough to permit ices to form out of water and…and out of gases like methane and carbon dioxide  Loose collections of these ices and small rocky particles form into comets  So comets are similar in composition to the gas giants  

Both comets and asteroids are   typically are smaller than planets  An even smaller type of interplanetary debris is the meteoroid  And it s from meteoroids that we get meteors and meteorites   Roids  are  for the most part anyway  they are just smaller bits of asteroids and comets  When these bits enter Earth s atmosphere  well  that makes them so special that they get a special name  They re called meteors  Most of them are very small  and they burn up soon after entering Earth s atmosphere  The larger ones that make it through the atmosphere and hit the ground are called meteorites  So meteorites are the ones that actually make it through 

Now we ve been finding meteorites on Earth for thousands of years  and we ve analyzed enough of them to learn a lot about their composition  most come from asteroids  though a few may have come from comets  So essentially they are rocks  and like rocks  they re mixtures of minerals  They are generally classified into three broad categories  stones  stony irons and irons 

Stone meteorites  which we refer to simply as  uh  stones  are almost entirely rock material  They actually account for almost all of the meteorite material that falls to earth  But even so  it s rare to ever find one  I mean  it s easier to find an iron meteorite or a stony iron  Anyone guess why  Look at their names  What do you think iron meteorites consist of 

Student 
Mostly iron 

Professor 
Yeah… iron and some nickel  both of which are metals  And  if you re trying to find metal 

Student 
Oh  Metal detectors 

Professor 
Right  thank you  At least that s part of it  Stone meteorites  if they lie around exposed to the weather for a few years  well  they re made of rock  so they end up looking almost indistinguishable from common terrestrial rocks  ones that originated on earth  So it s hard to spot them by eye  But we can use metal detectors to help us find the others  and they re easier to spot by eye  So most of the meteorites in collections  uh  in museums  they ll be   they re iron meteorites  or the stony iron kind  even though they only make up about 5 percent of the meteorite material on the ground

Listen to a conversation between a student and the librarian employee  

Student 
Hi  I am looking for this book   the American judicial system  And I can t seem to find it anywhere  I need to read a chapter for my political science class 

Librarian 
Let me check in the computer  Um… doesn t seem to be checked out and it s not on reserve  You ve checked the shelves I assume 

Student 
Yeah  I even checked other shelves and tables next to where the book should be 

Librarian 

Well  it s still here in the library  So people must be using it  You know this seems to be a very popular book tonight  We show six copies  None are checked out  And  yet you didn t even find one copy on the shelves  Is it a big class 

Student 
Maybe about Seventy Five 

Librarian 
Well  you should ask your professor to put some of the copies on reserve  You know about the  Reserve system   right 

Student 
I know that you have to read reserve books in the library and that you have time limits  But I didn t know that I could ask a professor to put a book on reserve  I mean I thought the professors make that kind of decisions at the beginning of the semester 

Librarian 
Oh… they can put books on reserve at anytime during the semester  

Student 
You know reserving book seems a bit unfair  What if someone who is not in the class wants to use the book 

Librarian 
That s why I said some copies 

Student 
Ah  well  I ll certainly talk to my professor about it tomorrow  But what I am gonna do tonight 

Librarian 
I guess you could walk around the Poli Sci  Political Science  section and look at the books waiting to be re shelved 

Student 
There do seem to be more than normal 

Librarian 
We are a little short staffed right now  Someone quit recently  so things aren t getting re shelved as quickly as usual  I don t think they ve hired a replacement yet  so  yeah  the un shelved books can get a bit out of hand 

Student 
This may sound a bit weird  But I ve been thinking about getting a job  Um… I ve never worked in a library before  But…  

Librarian 
That s not a requirement  The job might still be open  At the beginning of the semester we were swamped with applications  but I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now  

Student 
What can you tell me about the job 

Librarian 
Well  we work between six and ten hours a week  so it s a reasonable amount  Usually we can pick the hours we want to work  But since you d be starting so late in the semester  I m not sure how that would work for you  And… Oh… we get paid the normal university rates for student employees 

Student 
So who do I talk to 

Librarian 
I guess you talk to Dr  Jenkins  the head librarian  She does the hiring 

 
TPO 14 Lecture 1 Psychology

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class

Professor 
We ve said that the term  Cognition  refers to mental states like  knowing and believing  and to mental processes that we use to arrive at those states  So for example  reasoning is a cognitive process  so is perception  We use information that we perceive through our senses to help us make decisions  to arrive at beliefs and so on  And then there are memory and imagination which relate to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future  So perceiving  remembering  imagining are all internal mental processes that lead to knowing or believing  

Yet  each of these processes has limitations and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions  

Take memory for example  maybe you have heard of studies in which people hear a list of related words  Um…  let`s say a list of different kinds of fruit  After hearing this list  they are presented with several additional words  In this case  we`ll say the additional words were  blanket  and  cherry   Neither of these words was on the original list  and while people will claim correctly that  blanket  was not on the original list  they ll also claim incorrectly that the word  cherry  was on the list  Most people are convinced they heard the word  cherry  on the original list  Why did they make such a simple mistake  Well  we think because the words on the list were so closely related  the brain stored only the gist of what it heard  For example  that all the items on the list were types of fruit  When we tap our memory  our brains often fill in details and quite often these details are actually false  

We also see this  fill in  phenomenon with perception  Perception is the faculty that allows us to process information in the present as we take it in via our senses  Again  studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought they perceived even when they didn t  For example  experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence  but it is missing the word that logically completes it  They ll claim to hear that word even though it was never said  So if I were to say…er…the Sun rises in the…and then fail to complete the sentence  people will often claim to have heard the word  east  

In cognitive psychology  we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate  filling in of details     it s called  A Blind Spot  The term originally refers to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain  There are no photoreceptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye  So that particular area of the eye is incapable of detecting images  It produces  A Blind Spot  in our field of vision  We aren t aware of it  because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the image  so the picture always appears complete to us  But the term  blind spot  has also taken on a more general meaning    it refers to people being unaware of a bias that may affect their judgment about a subject  

And the same  blind spot phenomenon  that affects memory and perception also affects imagination  Imagination is a faculty that some people use to anticipate future events in their lives  But the ease with which we imagine details can lead to unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions 

So…um…Peter  suppose I ask you to imagine a lunch salad  no problem  right  But I bet you imagine specific ingredients  Did yours have tomatoes  Onion  Lettuce  mine did  Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people s image of a salad  which could lead to disappointment for us  If the next time we order a salad in a restaurant  we have our imagined salad in mind  that s not necessarily what we ll get on our plate  The problem is not that we imagine things  but that we assume what we ve imagined is accurate  We should be aware that our imagination has this built in feature  the blind spot  which makes our predictions fall short of reality  
 
TPO 14 Lecture 2 Biology

Narrator 

Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor 

Almost all animals have some way of regulating their body temperature  otherwise they wouldn t survive extreme hot or cold conditions   sweating  panting  swimming to cooler or warmer water  ducking into somewhere cool like a burrow or a hole under a rock  these are just a few  And that spot is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment  because it s a microclimate 

A microclimate is a group of climate conditions that affect a localized area  weather features like temperature  wind  moisture and so on  And when I say localized  I mean really localized  because microclimates can be  as the name suggests  pretty small  even less than a square meter  And microclimates are affected by huge number of other variables  Obviously weather conditions in the surrounding area are a factor  But other aspects of the location like  um… the elevation of the land  the plant life nearby  and so on  have a substantial effect on microclimates  And of course the human development in the area  um  a road will affect a nearby microclimate  It s also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other can have very different conditions  In the forest for example  there can be a number of very different microclimates close to each other  because of all the variables I just mentioned 

Student 

So how does a hole in the ground  a burrow  stay cool in a hot climate 

Professor 

Well  since cold air sinks  and these spots are shaded  they are usually much cooler than the surrounding area  And these spots are so important because many animals rely on microclimates to regulate their body temperature  Um  for instance  there is a species of squirrel  in the Western part of the United States that can get really hot when they are out foraging for food  So they need a way to cool down  So what do they do  They go back to their own burrow  Once they get there  their body temperatures decrease very  very quickly  The trip to the burrow prevents the squirrel from getting too hot 

Student 

But squirrels are mammals  right  I thought mammals regulated their temperature
internally 

Professor 

Mammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature  but not all can do it to the same degree  or even the same way  Like when you walk outside on a hot day  you perspire  and your body cools itself down  a classic example of how a mammal regulates its own body temperature  But one challenge that squirrels face  well many small mammals do  is that because of their size  sweating would make them lose too much moisture  They dehydrate  But on the other hand  their small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces  So for small mammals  microclimates can make a big difference  They rely on microclimates for survival  
Student 

So cold blooded animals  like reptiles  they can t control their own body temperature  so I can imagine the effect a microclimate would have on them 

Professor 

Yes  many reptiles and insects rely on microclimates to control their body temperature  A lot of reptiles use burrows or stay under rocks to cool down  Of course with reptiles  it s a balancing act  Staying in the heat for too long can lead to problems  but staying in the cold can do the same  So reptiles have to be really precise about where they spend their time  even how they position their bodies  And when I say they re precise  I mean it    some snakes will search out a place under rocks of a specific thickness  because too thin a rock doesn t keep them cool enough  and too thick a rock will cause them to get too cold  That level of precision is critical to the snake for maintaining its body temperature  

And even microscopic organisms rely on microclimates for survival  Think about this  decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil  the warm soil in turn affects the growth  the conditions of organisms there  And those organisms then affect the rate of decomposition of the leaves  So a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that even a tiny change can have a big impact  If someone on a hike knocks a couple of rocks over  they could be unwittingly destroying a microclimate that an animal or organism relies on

I know I have been really busy    a friend of mine works on the school paper  He asks me if I would like to try reporting so I did and I really love it 

Advisor 
Hey…that s sounds great 

Student 

Yeah… the first article I wrote  it was a profile of the chemistry professor   the one who was named Teacher of the Year  My article ran on the front page  When I saw my name  I mean my byline in print  I was hooked  Now I know this is what I want to do    be a reporter  

Advisor 

Isn t it great to discover something that you really enjoy  And I read that the article too  It was very good 

Student 

To be honest  the article got lots of editing  In fact I barely recognized a couple of paragraphs  But the editor explained why the changes were made  I learned a lot and my second article didn t need nearly as many changes 

Advisor 

Sounds like you ve got a real knack for this 

Student 

Yeah… anyway  I am glad you scheduled this meeting  cause I want to change my major to journalism now 

Advisor 
Um    the university doesn t offer a major in journalism 

Student 

Oh no…

Advisor 

But… 

Student 

I… I mean… should I transfer to another school  or major in English 

Advisor 
Well… wait a minute  Let me explain why the major isn t offered  Editors at newspaper… editors… I mean when you apply for a reporting job  editors look at two things    they want to see clips  you know  some of your published articles  they ll also want you to try out  they ll give you an assignment like… covering a press conference or some other event  then see if you can craft a story about it  accurately  on deadline 

Student 

So they don t even look at my major 

Advisor 

It is not that they don t look at it… it is… well  having a degree in something other than journalism should actually work to your advantage 

Student 
How 

Advisor 

Most journalists specialize these days  They only write about science or business or technology for example  Is there a type of reporting you think you may like to specialize in 

Student 

Well… I think it d be really cool to cover the Supreme Court  I mean… their decisions
affect so many people 

Advisor 

That is really a goal worth striving for  So  why not continue major in political science  And as electives  you could take some Pre Law classes like Constitutional Law  and as for your work on the student newspaper  maybe they d let you cover some local court cases    ones that students and professors here would want to read about 

Student 
Do you know of any？ 

Advisor 
I do  Actually  there is case involving this computer software program that one of our professors wrote  The district court is deciding if the university is entitled to any of the professor s profits 

Student 
Wow…  I will definitely follow up on that 

 
TPO 14 Lecture 3 Astronomy

Narrator 

Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 

Professor 

OK  last time we talked about ancient agricultural civilizations that observed the stars and then used those observations to keep track of the seasons  But today I want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers  about how the fixed patterns of stars were used as navigational aids 

OK  you ve all heard about the Vikings and their impressive navigation skills  but the seafaring peoples of the Pacific islands  the Polynesians and the Micronesians  were quite possibly the world s greatest navigators  Long before the development of  uh  advanced navigational tools in Europe  Pacific islanders were travelling from New Zealand to Hawaii and back again  using nothing but the stars as their navigational instruments 

Um  the key to the Pacific islanders  success was probably their location near the equator  What that meant was that the sky could be partitioned  divided up  much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the equator  Unlike the Vikings  early observers of the stars in Polynesia or really anywhere along the equator would feel that they were at the very center of things  with the skies to the north and the skies to the south behaving identically  they could see stars going straight up in the east and straight down in the west  So it was easier to discern the order in the sky than farther north or farther south  where everything would seem more chaotic 

Take the case of the Gilbert Islands  they are part of Polynesia  and lie very close to the equator  And the people there were able to divide the sky into symmetrical boxes  according to the main directions  north  east  south and west  And they could precisely describe the location of a star by indicating its position in one of those imaginary boxes  And they realized that you had to know the stars in order to navigate  In fact there was only one word for both in the Gilbert Islands  when you wanted the star expert  you ask for a navigator 

Um  islanders from all over the Pacific learned to use the stars for navigation  and they passed this knowledge down from generation to generation  Some of them utilized stone structures called stone canoes  uh  and these canoes were on land  of course  and you can still see them on some islands today  They were positioned as if they were heading in the direction of the points on the sea horizon where certain stars would appear and disappear during the night  and  um  young  would be navigators sat by the stones at night and turned in different directions to memorize the constellations they saw  so they could recognize them and navigate… by them later on when they went out to sea 

One important way the Polynesians had for orienting themselves was by using zenith stars  A zenith star was a really bright star that would pass directly overhead at a particular latitude…at a particular distance from the equator  often at a latitude associated with some particular Pacific island  So the Polynesians could estimate their latitude just by looking straight up  by observing whether a certain zenith star passed directly overhead at night  they d know if they have reached the same latitude as a particular island they were trying to get to  

Um  another technique used by the Polynesians was to look for a star pair  that s two stars that rise at the same time  or set at the same time  and navigators could use these pairs of stars as reference points  because they rise or set together only at specific latitudes  So navigators might see one star pair setting together  And  uh…would know how far north or south of the equator they were  And if they kept on going  and the next night they saw the pair of stars setting separately  then they would know that they were at a different degree of latitude  So looking at rising and setting star pairs is a good technique  Um… actually it makes more sense with setting stars  they can be watched instead of trying to guess when they ll rise 

Uh  OK  I think all this shows that navigating doesn t really require fancy navigational instruments  the peoples of Pacific islands had such expert knowledge of astronomy as well as navigation that they were able to navigate over vast stretches of open ocean  Uh  it s even possible that Polynesian navigators had already sailed to the Americas  centuries before Columbus 

 
TPO 14 Lecture 4 Archeology

Narrator 

Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class

Professor 
When we think of large monumental structures built by early societies  an Egyptian pyramid probably comes to mind  But there are some even earlier structures in the British Isles also worth discussing  and besides the well known circle of massive stones of Stonehenge  which don t get me wrong is remarkable enough  well  other impressive Neolithic structures are found there too  Oh  yes  we are talking about the Neolithic period here  also called new Stone Age  which was the time before stone tools began to be replaced by tools made of bronze and other metals  It was about 5000 years ago  even before the first Egyptian pyramid that some amazing Neolithic monuments   tombs  were erected at various sites around Ireland  Great Britain and coastal islands nearby 
I am referring particular to structures that in some cases  look like ordinary natural hills but were definitely built by humans  well organized communities of humans to enclose a chamber or room within stone walls and sometimes with a high  cleverly designed ceiling of overlapping stones  These structures are called Passage Graves  because the inner chamber  sometimes several chambers in fact  could only be entered from the outside through a narrow passageway 

Michael 
Excuse me  professor  but you said Passage Graves  Were these just monuments to honor the dead buried there or were they designed to be used somehow by the living 

Professor 
Ah  yes  Good question  Michael  Besides being built as tombs  some of these Passage Graves were definitely what we might call Astronomical Calendars  with chambers that were flooded with sunlight on certain special days of the year  which must ve have seemed miraculous and inspired a good deal of religious wonder  But research indicates that not just light but also the physics of sound helped enhance
this religious experiences 

Michael 
How so 

Professor 
Well  first the echoes  When a religious leader started chanting with echoes bouncing off the stonewalls over and over again  it must ve seemed like a whole chorus of other voices  spirits of Gods maybe  joining in  

But even more intriguing is what physicists called
Standing Waves  Basically  the phenomenon of Standing Waves occurs when sound waves of the same frequency reflect off the walls and meet from opposite directions  So  the volume seems to alternate between very loud and very soft  You can stand quite near a man singing in loud voice and hardly hear him  Yet step a little further away and his voice is almost deafening  As you move around the chamber  the volume of the sound goes way up and way down  depending on where you are in these standing waves  And often the acoustics make it hard to identify where sounds are coming from  It s as if powerful voices are speaking to you or chanting from inside your own head  This had to engender a powerful sense of awe in Neolithic worshipers 

And another bit of physics at play here is something called Resonance  I am no physicist  but well I imagine you have all blown air over the top of an empty bottle and heard the sound it makes  And you ve probably noticed that depending on its size    each empty bottle plays one particular musical note  Or as a physicist might put it  each bottle resonates at a particular frequency  Well  that s true of these chambers too  If you make a constant noise inside the chamber  maybe by steadily beating drum at a certain rate  a particular frequency of sound will resonate  will ring out intensely  depending on the size of the chamber  In some of the larger chambers though  these intensified sound may be too deep for us to hear  we can feel it  We are mysteriously agitated by it… but it is not a sound our ears can hear  

The psychological effects of all these extraordinary sounds can be profound  especially when they seem so disconnected from the human doing the drumming or chanting  And there can be observable physical effects on people too  In fact  the sounds can cause headaches  feelings of dizziness  increased heart rate  that sort of thing  you see  Anyway  what was experienced inside one of these Passage Graves clearly could be far more intense than the everyday reality outside  which made them very special places 

But back to your question  Michael  as to whether these Graves were designed to be used by the living  Well  certainly  with regard to astronomical or calendar function  That seems pretty obvious  and I wanna go into more detail on that now

TPO 15 Lecture 1 Psychology

Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class
Professor 
For decades  psychologists have been looking at our ability to perform tasks while other things are going on  how we are able to keep from being distracted and what the conditions for good concentration are  

As long ago as 1982  researchers came up with something called the CFQ   the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire  This questionnaire asks people to rate themselves according to how often they get distracted in different situations  like um …    forgetting to save a computer file because they had something else on their mind or missing a speed limit sign on the road  John 
John
I ve lost my share of computer files  but not because I m easily distracted  I just forget to save them 
Professor 
And that s part of the problem with the CFQ  It doesn t take other factors into account enough  like forgetfulness  Plus you really can   t say you are getting objective scientific results from a subjective questionnaire where people report on themselves  

So it   s no surprise that someone attempted to design an objective way to measure distraction  I t   s a simple computer game designed by a psychologist named  Nilli Lavie  In Lavie   s game  people watch as the letters N and X appear and disappear in a certain area on the computer screen  Every time they see an N  they press one key  and every time they see an X they press another  except other letters also start appearing in the surrounding area of the screen with increasing frequency which creates a distraction and makes the task more difficult  Lavie observed that people   s reaction time slowed as these distractions increased 

Student 2 
Well that s not too surprising  is it 

Professor 
No  it s not  It s the next part of the experiment that was surprising  When the difficulty really increased  when the screen filled up with letters  people got better at spotting the Xs and Ns   Why do you think that happened 

John
Well  maybe when we are really concentrating  we just don t perceive irrelevant information   Maybe we just don t take it in  you know 

Professor 
Yes  and that s one of the hypotheses that was proposed  that the brain simply doesn t admit the unimportant information  The second hypothesis is that  yes  we do perceive everything  but the brain categorizes the information  and whatever is not relevant to what we are concentrating on gets treated as low priority  

So Lavie did another experiment  designed to look at this ability to concentrate better in the face of increased difficulty  This time she used brain scanning equipment to monitor activity in a certain part of the brain  the area called V5  which is part of the visual cortex  the part of our brains that processes visual stimuli  V5 is the area of the visual cortex that s responsible for the sensation of movement  Once again  Lavie gave people a computer based task to do 
They have to distinguish between words in upper and lower case letters or even harder  they had to count the number of syllables in different words  This time the distraction was a moving star field in the background  you know  where it looks like you are moving through space  passing stars  Normally area of V5 would be stimulated as those moving stars are perceived and sure enough  Lavie found that during the task area of V5 was active  so people were aware of the moving star field  That means people were not blocking out the distraction 

Student
So doesn t that mean that the first hypothesis you mentioned was wrong  the one that says we don t even perceive irrelevant information when we are concentrating 

Professor 
Yes that s right  up to a point  but that s not all  Lavie also discovered that as she made the task more difficult   V5 became less active  so that means that now people weren t really noticing the star field at all  That was quite a surprise and it proved that the second hypothesis – that we do perceive everything all the time but the brain categorizes distractions differently  well  that wasn t true either  

Lavie thinks the solution lies in the brain s ability to accept or ignore visual information  She thinks its capacity is limited  It s like a highway  When there are too many cars  traffic is stopped  No one can get on  So when the brain is loaded to capacity  no new distractions can be perceived   

Now that may be the correct conclusion for visual distractions  but more research is needed to tell us how the brain deals with  say  the distractions of solving a math problem when we are hungry or when someone is singing in the next room 
 
TPO 15 Lecture 2 Geology

Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class  

Professor 
As geologists  we examine layers of sediment on the Earth  s surface to approximate the dates of past geologic time periods  Uh    sediment as you know  is material like sand   gravel  fossil fragments that is transported by natural processes like wind   water flow or the movement of glaciers  So sediment is transported and then deposited and it forms layers on the Earth s surface over time  We examine these layers to learn about different geologic time periods including when they began and ended 

For example  from about 1 8 million years ago to around 11 thousand years ago was the Pleistocene Epoch  The Pleistocene Epoch was an ice age  During this Epoch  sediment was made by the kind of erosion and weathering that happens when the climate is colder  and part of those sediments are fossils of plants and animals that lived at that time 

The Holocene Epoch followed the Pleistocene Epoch when the Earth   s climate warmed up around 11 thousand years ago  The Holocene Epoch is characterized by different sediments  ones that form when the climate is warmer  Because the climate changed  the types of plants and animals changed also  Holocene sediments contain remnants of more recent plants and animals  so it s pretty easy to differentiate geologically between these two Epochs 

Now there is growing evidence that the presence of humans has altered the Earth so much that a new Epochc of geologic history has begun – the Anthropocene Epoch  a new human influenced Epoch  This idea that we ve entered a new Anthropocene Epoch was first proposed in 2002  The idea is that around the year 1800 CE the human population became large enough  around a billion people  that its activities started altering the environment  

This was also the time of the industrial revolution  which brought a tremendous increase in the use of fossil fuels such as coal  The exploitation of fossil fuels has brought planet wide developments  industrialization  construction  uh  mass transport  And these developments have caused major changes like additional erosion of the Earth s surface and deforestation  Also  things like the damming of rivers   has caused increased sediment production  not to mention the addition of more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere  Naturally all these changes show up in recent sediments  And these sediments are quite different from pre year 1800 sediment layers 

Interestingly there s some speculation that humans started having a major impact on Earth much earlier  about 8000 years ago  That s when agriculture was becoming widespread  Early farmers started clearing forests and livestock produced a lot of extra methane  But I want to stress this is just a hypothesis  The idea that early humans could have had such a major effect  well I m just not sure we can compare it with the industrial age  

Geologists in the far future will be able to examine the sediment being laid down today  whereas right now we can say that yes  human impact on the Earth is clear  It ll be future researchers who have a better perspective and will be able to really draw a line between the Holocene and the Anthropocene Epochs

Hi Samantha  how did your track meet go 
Samantha 
Great  I placed first in one race and third in another 
Professor 
Congratulations   You must practice a lot 
Samantha 
Three times a week pre season  but now that we re competing every weekend  we practice 6 days a week from 3 30 till 5 00 
Professor 
Athletics place a heavy demand on your time  don   t they 
Samantha 
Yeah  but I really love competing  so …
Professor 
You know I played soccer in college and my biggest challenge  and I didn t always succeed  was getting my studying in during soccer season  Are you having a similar …
Samantha 
No  I … I really do make time to study  And I actually study more for this class than I do for all my other classes  But I didn   t see the grade I expected on my mid term exam  which is why I came by 
Professor 
Well  you didn t do badly on the exam  but I agree it did not reflect your potential  I say this because your work on the lab project was exemplary  I was so impressed with the way you handle the microscope and the samples of onion cells  and with how carefully you observed and diagramed and interpreted each stage of cell division  And I don t think you could have done that if you hadn t read and understood the chapter  I mean it seemed like you really had a good understanding of it 
Samantha 
I thought so too  but I missed some questions about cell division on the
exam 
Professor 
So what happened 
Samantha 
I just sort of blanked out  I guess  I had a hard time remembering details 
It was so frustrating 
Professor 
Alright  let s back up  You say you studied  where  at home 
Samantha 
At my kitchen table actually 
Professor 
And that s supposed to be a quiet environment 
Samantha 
Not exactly  My brother and parents try to keep it down when I am studying  but the phone pretty much rings off the hook  so …
Professor 
So you might try a place with fewer distractions  like the library …
Samantha 
But the library closes at mid night  and I like to study all night before a test  you know  so everything is fresh in my mind  I studied six straight hours the night before the mid term exam   That   s why I expected to do so much better 
Professor 
Oh ok  You know that studying six consecutive hours is not equivalent to studying one hour a day for six days 
Samantha 
It isn t 
Professor 
No  There is research that shows that after about an hour of intense focus  your brain needs a break  It needs to  you know  shift gears a little  Your brain s ability to absorb information starts to decline after about the first hour  So if you are dealing with a lot of new concepts and vocabulary  anyway  if you just review your notes  even 20 minutes a day  it d be much better than waiting until the night before an exam to try and absorb all those details 
Samantha 
Oh  I didn t realize 
Professor 
Think of your brain as a muscle  If you didn t practice regularly with your track team  and then tried to squeeze in three weeks worth of running practice the day before a track meet  how well do you think you d perform in your races 
 
TPO 15 Lecture 3 Art History

Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 

Professor  
Now in Europe in the Middle Ages before the invention of printing and the printing press  all books  all manuscripts were hand made  And the material typically used for the pages was parchment  which is animal skin that s stretched and dried under tension  so it become s really flat and can be written on   During the 1400s  when printing was being developed  paper became the predominant material for books in Europe  but prior to that  it was parchment  Parchment is durable  much more so than paper  and it could be reused which came in handy since it was a costly material and in short supply  so it wasn t uncommon for the scribes or monks who produced the manuscripts   

Ah  remember before printing books were made mainly in monasteries   Well  the scribes often recycled the parchment that d been used for earlier manuscripts  They simply
erased the ink off the parchment and wrote something new in its place
A manuscript page that was written on  erased and then used again is
called a palimpsest  

Palimpsests were created  well  we know about two methods that were used for removing ink from parchment  In the late Middle Ages  it was customary to scrape away the surface of the parchment with an abrasive  which completely wiped out any writing that was there  But earlier in the Middle Ages  the original ink was usually removed by washing the used parchment with milk  That removed the ink  But with the passing of time  the original writing might reappear  In fact   it might reappear to the extent that scholars could make out and even decipher the original text  

Perhaps  the most famous example is the Archimedes  palimpsest 

Archimedes lived in Greece around 200 BCE  and as you probably know  he s considered one of the greatest Mathematicians who ever lived  even though many of his writings had been lost   including what many now think to be his most important work called The Method   

But in 1998  a book of prayers from the Middle Ages sold in an art auction for a lot of money  more money than anyone would pay for a damaged book from the 12th century  Beautiful or not  why  It had been discovered that the book was a palimpsest  and beneath the surface writing of the manuscript laid  guess what  Mathematical theorems and diagrams from Archimedes 

Archimedes  writings were originally done on papyrus scrolls  Then in the 10th century  a scribe made a copy on parchment of some of his texts and diagrams including  as it turns out  The Method   This was extremely fortunate  since later on  the original papyrus scrolls disappeared  About 200 years later in the 12th century  this parchment manuscript became a palimpsest when a scribe used the parchment to make a prayer book  So the pages  the pieces of parchment themselves  had been preserved  But the Archimedes  text was erased and written over  and no one knew it existed  

It wasn t until 1906 that a scholar came across the prayer book in a library and realized it was a palimpsest  and that the underlying layer of texts could only have come from Archimedes  That was when his work The Method was discovered for the first time 

Um    the palimpsest then went through some more tough times  but eventually it ended up in an art auction where was bought and then donated to an art museum in Baltimore  for conservation and study  To avoid further damage to the manuscript  the research team at the art museum has had to be extremely selective in the techniques they used to see the original writing  They ve used ultraviolet light and some other techniques  and if you re interested in that sort of thing  you can learn more about it in an art conservation class  

But actually  it was a physicist who came up with a method that was a breakthrough  He realized that the iron in the ancient ink would display if exposed to a certain X ray imaging method  and except for small portions of the text that couldn t be deciphered  this technique s been very helpful in seeing Archimedes  texts and drawings through the medieval overwriting 


 
TPO 15 Lecture 4 Biology

Narrator  
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor  
OK  We ve been talking till now about the two basic needs of a biological
community – an energy source to produce organic materials  you know
uh  food for the organisms  and the waste recycling or breakdown of
materials back into inorganic molecules  and about how all this requires
photosynthesis when green plants or microbes convert sunlight into
energy  and also requires microorganisms  bacteria  to secrete chemicals
that break down or recycle the organic material to complete the cycle 

So  now we are done with this chapter of the textbook  we can just
review for the weekly quiz and move on to the next chapter  right  Well 
not so fast  First  I  d like to talk about some discoveries that have
challenged one of these fundamental assumptions about what you need
in order to have a biological community 

And  well  there actually were quite a few surprises  It all began in 1977 with the exploration of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor  Hydrothermal vents are cracks in the Earth s surface that occur  well  the ones we are taiking about here are found deep at the bottom of the ocean  And these vents on the ocean floor  they release this incredibly hot water  3 to 4 times the temperature that you boil water at  because this water has been heated deep within the Earth  

Well about 30 years ago  researchers sent a deep sea vessel to explore the ocean s depth  about 3 kilometers down  way deep to the ocean floor  No one had ever explored that far down before  Nobody expected there to be any life down there because of the conditions  

First of all  sunlight doesn t reach that far down so it   s totally dark  There couldn t be any plant or animal life since there s no sunlight  no source of energy to make food  If there was any life at all  it d just be some bacteria breaking down any dead materials that might have fallen to the bottom of the ocean   And 

Student 1 
And what about the water pressure  Didn t we talk before about how the deeper down into the ocean you go  the greater the pressure 

Professor 
Excellent point  And not only the extreme pressure  but also the extreme temperature of the water around these vents  If the lack of sunlight didn t rule out the existence of a biological community down there then these factors certainly would  or so they thought 

Student 2
So you are telling us they did find organisms that could live under those conditions 

Professor  
They did indeed  something like 300 different species 

Student 1 
But    but how could that be  I mean without sunlight  no energy  no no …

Professor 
What they discovered was that microorganisms  bacteria  had taken over both functions of the biological community   the recycling of waste materials and the production of energy  They were the energy source  You see  it turns out that certain microorganisms are chemosynthetic   they don t need sunlight because they take their energy from chemical reactions 

So  as I said  unlike green plants which are photosynthetic and get their energy from sunlight  these bacteria that they found at the ocean floor  these are chemosynthetic  which means that they get their energy from chemical reactions  How does this work 

As we said  these hydrothermal vents are releasing into the ocean depth this intensely hot water and here is the thing  this hot water contains a chemical called hydrogen sulfide  and also a gas   carbon dioxide  Now these bacteria actually combine the hydrogen sulfide with the carbon dioxide and this chemical reaction is what produces organic material which is the food for larger organisms  The researchers had never seen anything like it before 

Student 2  
Wow  So just add a chemical to a gas  and bingo  you ve got a food supply 

Professor 
Not just that  W hat was even more surprising were all the large organisms that lived down there  The most distinctive of these was something called the tube worm  Here  let me show you a picture   The tube of the tube worm is really  really long  They can be up to one and a half meters long   and these tubes are attached to the ocean floor  pretty weird looking  huh 

And another thing  the tube worm has no mouth or digestive organs  So you are asking how does it eat  Well  they have these special organs that collect the hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and then transfer it to
another organ  where billions of bacteria live  These bacteria that live
inside the tube worms  the tube worms provide them with hydrogen
sulfide and carbon dioxide  And the bacteria  well the bacteria kind of
feed the tube worms through chemosynthesis  remember  that chemical
reaction I described earlier

Forget about singing  I mean  we keep the windows down and everything  but once those bulldozers get going  I mean those machines are loud  We ve already had to cut short two rehearsals and we ve got a concert in 6 weeks 

Manager 
Well  that s not good  I m assuming you ve tried to reschedule your rehearsals  They don t do construction work at night 

Student 
I ran that by the group  but there were just too many    I mean evenings are really hard  It seems like everyone in the choir already has plans and some even have classes at night  

Manager 
And what about the music building 

Student 
You know  originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building  but then we switched with the jazz ensemble  They re a much smaller group and they said the acoustics  the sound in that room  was better for them  So having us move to a bigger space like the Lincoln Auditorium seemed like a reasonable idea 

Manager 
But now   

Student 
All that noise  I don t know  I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen  

Manager 
Well  that wouldn t be very nice 

Student 
No  But it really was quite a coincidence  Anyway  now the music building s fully booked  mornings  afternoons  everything  we just need a quiet space  And it has to have a piano 

Manager 
A piano  Of course some of the other auditoriums have pianos  but that s not going to be
easy 

Student 
You think they re pretty booked up 

Manager 
Probably  But it can t hurt to check  What about Bradford Hall  I remember a piano in
the old Student center there 

Student 
At this point  we d be grateful for any quiet place 

Manager 
Can you    How flexible can you be on times  You said no evenings  but what if can t find something open at 3 o clock  Can you move earlier or later 

Student 
I wish I could say another time would be okay  but you know how it is  everybody s already got commitments for the whole semester  2 30 or 3 30 would probably be okay  but I don t think we could go much outside that

Manager 
Well  check with me tomorrow morning  I should ve found something by then  It might
not be ideal   

Student 
As long as it s got a piano and nobody s putting up a building next door  we ll be happy 



TPO 16 Lecture 1 geology

Narrator 
Listen to a part of lecture in a geology class 

Professor 
Now there are some pretty interesting caves in parts of the western United States  especially in national parks  There is one part that has over a hundred caves  including some of the largest ones in the world  One of the more interesting ones is called Lechuguilla Cave  Lechuguilla has been explored a lot in recent decades  It s a pretty exciting place I think  It was mentioned only briefly in your books  So can anyone remember what it said  Ellen 

Male Student 
It s the deepest limestone cave in the U S  

Professor 
That s right  It s one of the longest and deepest limestone caves not just in the country but in the world  Now  what else 

Male Student 
Well  it was formed because of sulfuric acid  right 

Professor 
That s it  Yeah  what happens is you have deep underground oil deposits and there are
bacteria  Here let me draw a diagram 
Part of the limestone rock layer is permeated by water from below  Those curly lines are supposed to be cracks in the rock  Below the water table and rock is oil  Bacteria feed on this oil and release hydrogen sulfide gas  This gas is hydrogen sulfide  rises up and mixes with oxygen in the underground water that sits in the cracks and fissures in the limestone  And when hydrogen sulfide reacts with the oxygen in the water  the result of that is sulfuric acid  Ok  Sulfuric acid eats away at limestone very aggressively  So you get bigger cracks and then passageways being formed along the openings in the rock and it s all underground  Ah yes  Paul 

Male Student 
So that water    It s not flowing  right  It s still 

Professor 
Yes  so there s two kinds of limestone caves  In about 90 percent of them  you have water from the surface  streams  waterfall or whatever   moving water that flows through cracks found in the limestone  It s the moving water itself that wears away at the rock and makes passageways  

Also  in surface water  there is a weak acid  carbonic acid  not sulfuric acid  but carbonic acid that helps dissolve the rock  With a little help from this carbonic acid  moving water forms most of the world s limestone caves  When I was researching this for a study a few years ago  I visited a couple of these typical limestone caves  and they were all very wet  you know  from streams and rivers  This flowing water
carved out the caves and the structures inside them 

Male Student 
But not Lechuguilla 

Professor 
Dry as a bone  Well  that might be a bit of an exaggeration  But it s safe to say that it s sulfuric acid and not moving water that formed Lechuguilla cave and those few other ones like it  In fact  there is no evidence that flowing water has even gone in or out of the cave  So  it s like a maze  You have passageways all around  There are wide passages  narrow ones at all different depths  like underground tunnels in the limestone  And  since they were created underground and not from flowing surface water  not all these passageways have an opening to the outside world  

And    and there is other evidence that
flowing water wasn t involved in Lechuguilla  We ve said that sulfuric acid dissolves limestone  right  and forms the passageways  What else does sulfuric acid do  Paul 

Male Student 
Ah  leaves a chemical residue     um   

FeMale Student 
Gypsum  right 

Professor 
Yep  you ll find lots of gypsum deposited at Lechuguilla  And  as we know  gypsum is soluble in water  So if there were flowing water in the cave  it would dissolve the gypsum  This is part of what led us to the realization that Lechuguilla is in that small group of waterless caves  

And Lechuguilla is pretty much dormant now  It s not really forming any more  But  there is other ones like it  for example  in Mexico  that are forming  And when cave researchers go to explore them  they see and smell  the sulfuric acid and gases of   er   phew   now  something else  think of rotten eggs  And  it s not just the smell  Explorers even need to wear special masks to protect themselves from the gases in these caves  OK  Paul 

Male Student 
Yeah  how about what these caves look like on the inside 

Professor 
Well  the formations    there is really something  There s such variety there  like nothing anywhere else in the world  some of them are elaborate looking  like decorations  And a lot of them are made of gypsum and could be up to 20 feet long  It s pretty impressive 



TPO 16 Lecture 2 music history

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class 

Professor 
Up until now in our discussions and readings about the Baroque and early classical periods 
we ve been talking about the development of musical styles and genres within the
relatively narrow social context of its patronage by the upper classes  Composers  after all  had to earn a living and those who were employed in the services of a specific patron  well  I don t have to spell it out for you  the likes and dislikes of that patron  this would ve had an effect on what was being composed and performed  Now  of course  there were many other influences on composers  um  such as the technical advances we ve seen and the development of some of the instruments  uh  you remember the transverse flute  the clarinet and so on 

But I think if I were asked to identify a single crucial development in European music of this time  it would be the invention of the piano  which  interestingly enough also had a significant effect on European society of that time  And I ll get to that in a minute  

Now  as we know  keyboard instruments existed long before the piano   the organ  which dates back to the Middle Ages  as do other keyboard instruments  such as the harpsichord which is still popular today with some musicians  But none of these has had as profound an impact as the piano 

Uh  the piano was invented in Italy in 1709  The word piano is short for pianoforte  a combination of the Italian words for soft and loud  Now  unlike the harpsichord which came before it  the piano is a percussion instrument  You see  the harpsichord is actually classified as a string instrument  since pressing a key of a harpsichord causes a tiny quill that s connected to the key to pluck the strings that are inside the instrument  much the same as a guitar pick plucks the strings of a guitar But pressing the keys of a piano causes tiny felt covered hammers to strike the strings inside the instrument  like drumsticks striking the head of a drum  This striking action is why the piano is a percussion instrument instead of a string instrument  

Okay  so why is this so important  Well  the percussive effect of those little hammers means that the pianist  unlike the harpsichordist  can control the dynamics of the sound   how softly or loudly each note is struck  hence the name  pianoforte  soft and loud  

Now  artistically for both composers and performers this was a major turning point  This brand new instrument  capable of producing loud and soft tones  greatly expanded the possibilities for conveying emotion  This capacity for increased expressiveness  in fact  was essential to the Romantic style that dominated 19th century music  But I m getting ahead of myself 

Um  before we get back to the musical impact of this development  I wanna take a look at the social impact that I mentioned earlier  

Now  in the late 1700s and the earlier 1 800s  the development of the piano coincided with the growth of the middle class in Western Europe  Of course folk music  traditional songs and dances had always been part of everyday life  But as mass production techniques were refined in the 19th century  the price of pianos dropped to the point that a larger proportion of the population could afford to own them  As pianos became more available  they brought classical music  the music which previously had been composed only for the upper classes  into the lives of the middle class people as well  

One way in particular that we can see the social impact of this instrument is its role in the lives of women of the time  Previously  it was quite rare for a woman to perform on anything  but maybe a harp or maybe she sang  But suddenly in the 19th century it became quite acceptable  even  to some extent  almost expected for a middle class European woman to be able to play the piano  partly because among upper middle class women it was a sign of refinement  But it was also an excellent way for some women to earn money by giving piano lessons  

And some women  those few who had exceptional talent and the opportunity to develop it  their lives were dramatically affected  Later we ll be listening to works by a composer named Robert Schumann  But let s now talk about his wife Clara Schumann  Clara Schumann was born in Germany in 1819  She grew up surrounded by pianos  Her father sold pianos and both her parents were respected piano teachers  She learned to play the instrument when she was a small child and gave her first public recital at age 9  Clara grew up to become a well known and respected piano virtuoso  a performer of extraordinary skill who not only gave concerts across Europe  but also was one of the first important female composers for the instrument

Professor
Jeff  I m glad you drop by  I ve been meaning to congratulate you on the class leadership
award  

Student
Thanks Professor Brownson  I was really happy to get it and a little surprised  I mean  there were so many other people nominated 

Professor
Well  I know the award was well deserved  Now  what can I do for you today 

Student
I needed to talk to you about the medieval history test you know  the one scheduled for
Friday afternoon  

Professor
Yes 

Student
Well  there is this trip that my French class is taking  We are going to Montreal for the weekend 

Professor
Montreal  That s my favorite city  What ll you be seeing there 

Student
I m not sure yet  Well  the reason  the main reason I wanted to go is that we ll be rooming with French speaking Students there  you know  so we can get a chance to use our French  to actually talk with real French speakers  

Professor
It sounds like a good opportunity  But then  there is that test   

Student
Yeah    but   well  the thing is the bus leaves right in the middle of when our history class meets this Friday  So  well  I was thinking maybe I could take the test on a different day like Monday morning during your office hours 

Professor
Eh   Monday morning   um   that would not be   oh wait  let me just see one thing  Aha  okay  That s what I thought  So  for your class  I was planning a take home exam so you could just take the test along with you  Let s see  I guess you could come to class Friday just to pick up the test  That way you d still make your bus  and then find some quiet time during your trip to complete it and you can bring it to class Wednesday when I ll be collecting everyone else s 

Student
Hmm     um   during the trip  well  I guess I could  So I should plan to take my books and
stuff with me 

Professor
You ll definitely need your class notes  I m giving you several short essay questions to make you think critically about the points we ve discussed in class  to state    uh state and defend your opinion  analyze the issues  speculate about how things might have turned out differently  So  you see  I don t care if you look updates and that kind of thing  What I want is for you to synthesize information to reflect back on what we ve read and discussed and to form your own ideas  not just repeat points from the textbook  Does that make sense 

Student
Yeah  I think so  You are looking for my point of view 

Professor
That s right  The mid term exam showed me that you know all the details of who  where and when  For this test  I want to see how you can put it all together to show some original thinking 

Student
That s sounds pretty challenging  especially trying to work it into this trip  But  yeah  I think I can do it 

Professor
I m sure you can 

Student
Thank you  Professor Brownson 

Professor
Have a great time in Montreal 


 
TPO 16  Lecture 3 biology

Narrator 
Listen to a part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor
OK  Let s continue our discussion about animal behavior by talking about decisions that animals face  complex ones  Animals  even insects  carry out what look like very complex decision making processes  

The question is how  I mean no one really thinks that  say a bee goes through weighing the pros and cons of pollinating this flower or that flower  But then how do animals solve complex questions  questions that seem to require decision making  The answer we ll propose of course is that their behavior is largely a matter of natural selection  As an example  let s look at foraging behavior among beavers 

Beavers eat plants  mostly trees  And they also use trees and tree branches to construct their homes in streams and lakes  So when they do forage for food and for shelter materials  they have to leave their homes and go up on land where their main predators are  So there are a number of choices that have to be made about foraging  

So for example  um    they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down  Some trees have higher nutritional value than others  and some are better for building material  and some are good for both    um   aspen trees  Beavers peel off the bark to eat and they also use the branches for building their shelters  So aspens do double duty  But ash trees  beavers use ash trees only for construction  

Another decision is when to forage for food  Should they go out during the daytime when it s hotter outside and they have to expend more energy  or at night when the weather is cooler but predators are more active  Ok  but there are two more important issues  really the most central  the most important  OK  

First  let s say a beaver could get the same amount of wood from a single large tree  one that has lots of branches  as it could get from three small trees  Which should it choose  If it chooses one large tree  it ll have to carry that large piece of wood back home  and lugging a big piece of wood 40 or 50 yards is hard work  takes a lot of energy  Of course it ll have to make only one trip to get the wood back to the water  On the other hand  if it goes for three small trees instead  it will take less energy per tree to get the wood back home  but it ll have to make three trips back and forth for the three trees  And presumably  the more often it wanders from home  the more it s likely to be exposed to predators  So which is better  a single large tree or three small trees 
 
Another critical issue and it s related to the first  to the size issue  is how far from the water should it go to get trees  Should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree  since it ll get so much wood from it  Beavers certainly go farther from the water to get an aspen tree than for an ash tree  That reflects their relative values  But what about size  Will it travel farther for a larger tree than It will for a smaller tree  

Now I would have thought the bigger the
tree  the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it  That would make sense  right 
If you re going to travel far  make the trip worth it buy bringing back most wood possible 

But actually  the opposite is true  Beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water  They will travel far only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly  Generally  the farther they go from the water  the smaller the tree they will cut down  They re willing to make more trips to haul back less wood  which carries a greater risk of being exposed to predators  So it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their exposure to predators and more interested in saving energy when foraging for wood  which may also explain why beavers forage primarily during the evenings  

OK  so why does their behavior indicate more of a concern with how much energy they expend than with being exposed to predators  No one believes a beaver consciously weighs the pros and cons of each of these elements  The answer that some give is that their behavior has evolved over time  It s been shaped by constraints over vast stretches of time  all of which comes down to the fact that the best foraging strategy for beavers isn t the one that yields the most food or wood  It s the one that results in the most descendants  the most offspring  So let s discuss how this idea works 



TPO 16 Lecture 4 art history

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 

Professor
OK  now um  a sort of paradigmatic art form of the Middle Ages was stained glass art  Stained glass of course is simply glass that has been colored and cut into pieces and re assembled to form a picture or a decorative design  To truly experience the beauty of this decorative glass you should see it with light passing through it  especially sunlight  which is why stained glass is usually used for windows  But of course it has other uses  especially nowadays  

Um  anyway the art of making stained glass windows developed in Europe  urn  during the Middle Ages and was closely related to church building  In the early 1100s a church building method was developed that reduced the stress on the walls so more space could be used for window openings allowing for large and quite elaborate window designs  

Back then  the artists made their own glass  but first they came up with the design  Paper was scarce and expensive  so typically they drew the design onto a white tabletop  They d draw the principal outline but also outline the shape of each piece of glass to be used and indicate its color  

Now in the window itself the pieces of glass would be held together by strips of lead  So in the drawing the artists would also indicate the location of the lead strips  Then you could put a big piece of glass on the tabletop and see the design right through it and use it to guide the cutting of the glass into smaller pieces  
Student
And the lead that was just to hold the pieces of glass together 

Professor
Well  lead is strong and flexible so it s ideal for joining pieces of glasses cut in different shapes and sizes  But up to the 15th century the lead strips also helped create the design  They were worked into the window as part of the composition  They were used to outline figures to show boundaries just like you might use solid lines in a pencil drawing 

Student
How did they get the color   I mean how did they color the glass 

Professor
Well up until the 16th century stained glass was colored during the glass making process itself  You got specific colors by adding metallic compounds to the other glass making ingredients 
So if you wanted red you added copper  if you wanted green you added iron  You just added these compounds to the other ingredients that the glass was made of 

Student
So each piece of glass is just one color 

Professor
Yes  at least up until the 16th century  Then they started    um    you started to get painted glass  Painted glass windows are still referred to as stained glass but the colors were actually painted directly onto clear glass after the glass was made  So um     with this kind of stained glass  you could paint a piece of glass with more than one color 

Student
And with painted glass they still used the lead strips 

Professor
Yes  with really large windows it took more than one piece of glass  so you still needed lead strips to hold the pieces together  But the painters actually tried to hide them  So it was different from before when the lead strips were part of the design  And it is different  because with painted glass the idea of light corning through to create the magical effect wasn t the focus any more  The paintwork was  

And painted glass windows became very popular  In the 19th century  people started using them in private houses and public buildings  Unfortunately  many of the original stained glass windows were thought to be old fashioned and they were actually destroyed  replaced by painted glass 

Student
They actually broke them  That showed good judgment  real foresight  didn t it 

Professor
Yes  if only they had known  Uh  and it s not just that old stained glass is really valuable today  we lost possibly great artwork  But luckily there was a revival of the early techniques in the mid I 800s and artists went back to creating colored glass and using the lead strips in their designs  The effects are much more beautiful  

In the 19th century  Louis Tiffany came up with methods to create beautiful effects without having to paint the glass  He layered pieces of glass and used thin copper strips instead of lead  which let him make these really intricate flowery designs for stained glass  which he used in lampshades  You ve heard of Tiffany lampshades  right  These of course took advantage of the new innovation of electric lighting  Electric light bulbs don t give quite the same effect as sunlight streaming through stained glass  but it s close  So layered glass  Tiffany glass  became very popular and still is today  

So let s look at some examples of different types of stained glass from each era

Conversation 1

Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor  
 
Professor 
OK  let  s see  Right  Modern Stagings of a Shakespearian Classic  Well  like I told you last week  I think that s a great topic for you paper  So the title would be something like     uh     
 
Student 
I am not really sure  probably something like 20th
 century stagings of A Midsummer 
Night s Dream  
 
Professor 
Yes  I like that  Straightforward and to the point  So how is the research going  
 
Student 
Well  that s what I came to talk to you about  I was wondering if you happen to have 
a copy of the Peter Brook production of A Midsummer Night s Dream in your video 
collection  I ve been looking for it everywhere and I am having a really hard time 
tracking it down  


Professor 
That s because it doesn t exist  
 
Student 
You mean in your collection   Or at all  
 
Professor 
I mean at all  That particular production was never filmed or recorded  
 
Student 
Oh no  I had no idea  From what I read  that production  like  it influenced every other production of the play that came after it  So I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped  
 
Professor 
Oh  It definitely was a landmark production  And it s not like it ran for just a week  but either it was never filmed or if it was the film s been lost  And it  s ironic because there s even a film about the making of the production  but none of the production itself  
 
Student 
So now what do I do  If there is no video  
 
Professor 
Well  think about it  This is the most important 20th century staging of A Midsummer Night s Dream  right  
 
Student 
But how can I write about Brook s interpretation of the play if I can t see his 
production  
 
Professor
Just because there s no recording doesn t mean you can t figure out how it influenced other productions  
 
Student 
Yeah  I guess there s enough material around  but it will be a challenge  
 
Professor 
True  But think about it  you are writing about dramatic arts  the theater  and that  s the nature of theater  isn t it  
 
Student 
You mean because it is live  when the performance is finished     
 
Professor 
That s it  Unless it  s filmed  it s gone  But that doesn t mean we can t study it  And of course some students in this class are writing about productions in the 19th century  there are no videos of those  You know  one of the challenges for people who study theater is to find way of talking about something that  s really so transient  about something that  in a sense  doesn t exist  
TPO 17 Lecture 1 Art History Prehistoric Art Dating  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class  
 
Professor 
Good morning  ready to continue our review of prehistoric art  Today  we will be covering the Upper Paleolithic Period  which I am roughly defining as the period from 35 000 to 8 000 BC  A lot of those cave drawings you have all seen come from this period  But we are also be talking about portable works of art  things that could be carried around from place to place  Here is one example  This sculpture is called the Lady with the Hood1   and it was carved from ivory  probably a mammoth s tusk  Its age is a bit of a mystery  According to one source  it dates from 22 000 BC  But other sources claimed it has been dated closer to 30 000 BC  Amy  
 
Amy 
Why don t we know the exact date when this head was made  
 
Professor 
That s a fair question  We are talking about prehistory here  So obviously the artists didn t put a signature or a date on anything they did  So how do we know when this figure was carved  
 
Tom 
Last semester I took an archaeology class and we spent a lot time on  studying ways to date things  One technique I remember was using the location of an object to date it  like how deep it was buried  
 
Professor 
That would be Stratigraphy  Stratigraphy is used for dating portable art  When archaeologists are digging at a site  they make very careful notes about which stratum strata   which layer of earth they find things in  And  you know  the general rule is that the oldest layers are at the lowest level  But this only works if the site hasn t been touched  and the layers are intact  A problem with this dating method is that an object could have been carried around  used for several generations before it was discarded  So it might be much older than the layer or even the site where it was found  The stratification technique gives us the minimum age of an object  which isn t necessarily its true age  Tom  in your archaeology class  did you talk about radiocarbon dating  
 
Tom 
Yeah  we did  That had to do with chemical analysis  something to do with measuring the amount of radiocarbon that s left in organic stuff  Because we know how fast radiocarbon decays  we can figure out the age of the organic material  
 
Professor 
The key word there is organic  Is art made of organic material  
 
Tom 
Well  you said the lady with the hood was carved out of ivory  That  s organic  
 
Professor 
Absolutely  Any other examples  
 
Amy 
Well  when they did those cave drawings  Didn t they use  like charcoal or maybe 
colors  dyes made from plants  
 
Professor 
Fortunately  they did  at least some of the time  So it turns out that radiocarbon 
dating works for a lot of prehistoric art  But again there s a problem  This technique destroys what it analyzes  so you have to chip off bits of the object for testing  Obviously we are reluctant to do that in some cases  And apart from that  there s another problems  The date tells you the age of the material  say  a bone or a tree  the object is made from  but not the date when the artist actually created it  So  with radiocarbon dating  we get the maximum possible age for the object  but it could be younger  
Ok  let  s say our scientific analysis has produced an age range  Can we narrow it


down  
 
Amy 
Could we look for similar styles or motives  You know  try to find things common to one time period  
 
Professor 
We do that all the time  And when we see similarities in pieces of art  we assume some connection in time or place  But is it possible that we could be imposing our own values on that analysis  
 
Tom 
I am sorry  I don t get your point  
 
Professor 
Well  we have all kinds of pre conceived ideas about how artistic styles develop  For example  a lot of people think the presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more sophisticated artist  While a lack of detail suggests a primitive style  But trends in art in the last century or so certainly challenge that idea  Don t get me wrong though  analyzing the styles of prehistoric art can help dating them  But we need to be careful with the idea that artistic development occurs in a straight line  from simple to complex representations  
 
Amy 
What you are saying is  I mean  I get the feeling that this is like a legal process  like building a legal case  the more pieces of evidence we have  the closer we get to the truth  
 
Professor 
Great analogy  And now you can see why we don t have an exact date for our sculpture  the lady with the hood  
 
 
TPO 17 Lecture 2 Environmental Science Milankovitch Hypothesis  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class  
 
Professor 
Ok  so we have been talking about theories that deal with the effects of human activity on the climate  But today I d like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in climate  And one of the best known is called the Milankovitch Hypothesis  
 
Now what the Milankovitch Hypothesis is about  It says that variations in earth s movements  specifically in its orbit around the sun  these variations lead to differences in the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth  And it is these differences in the amount of energy that s reaching earth from the sun  it is what causes variations in earth s climate  
 
Ok  a lot of people think of earth s orbit around the sun as being perfectly circular  as smooth and as regular as  say  the way that hands move on a well  made watch  but it just doesn t work that way  You are probably aware that the earth s orbit around the sun  it is not shaped like a perfect circle  It is more of an oval  it is elliptical  But the shape of this orbit isn t consistent  it varies over time  over a period of about a thousand years  Sometimes it is a little more circular  sometimes it is more elliptical  And when earth s orbit is more elliptical  earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year  Which makes earth  and in particular  the northern hemisphere  warmer  And why is that important  well  because most of the planet s glaciers are in the northern hemisphere  and if it gets too warm  then glaciers will stop forming  And we ve already talked about how that affects earth s overall temperature  
 
The second movement involved in the hypothesis has to do with axial tilt  The tilt of earth s axis  that imaginery pole that runs through the center of the earth  And depending on the angle it tilts at  the seasons can be more or less severe  It makes winters cooler and summers warmer  or what some might say it is doing now  it makes summers less hot  and more importantly  the winters less cold  Which just like what I mentioned before  can also stop  prevent glaciers from forming  or cause them to melt  
 
There is a third movement the hypothesis covers called precession  Precession  basically is the change in the direction of earth s axis of rotation  It will take me a million years to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession is quite complex  And all these details are way beyond our scope  What s important for you to understand is that these three movements  well  they are cyclical  and they work together to form  to produce complex but regular variations in earth s climate  and lead to the growth or decline of glaciers  
 
Now  when Milankovitch first proposed this theory in the 1920s  many of his colleagues were skeptical  Milankovitch didn t have any proof  Actually there wouldn t be any evidence to support his hypothesis until the 1970s  when oceanographers were able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect samples  samples which were then analyzed by geologists  And from these samples they were able to put together a history of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years  and this showed that earth s climate had changed pretty much the way Milankovitch s hypothesis suggested it would  So this evidence was pretty strong support for the Milankovitch Hypothesis  And by the 1980s  most people accepted this theory  
 
However  in the late 1980s  some scientists were exploring Devil  s Hole  which is basically an extensive water filled cave  far from the ocean  in Nevada2
  in the 
western United States  Over millions of years  groundwater left deposits of a mineral 
called calcite3
  on the rock within Devil s Hole  And by studying these calcite deposits  
we can determine the climate conditions  the temperatures over the last half million 
years  Well  the Devil  s Hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the 
1970s  so basically the question was  were the ages of one or both the samples were 
wrong  or were scientists misunderstanding the significance of the evidence  
 
Well  in the 1990s  a new study was done on the two samples  And the ocean floor 
samples were found to be correct  as were the samples from Devil s Hole  And now it 
is generally believed that the sample from Devil s Hole correspond to variations in 
local climate  in the western United States  rather than global climate changes

Listen to a conversation between a student and a food service manager  
 
Student 
Excuse me  Mrs  Hanson  My name is John  John Grant  I work as a waiter in the campus dining hall  in the faculty dining room  
 
Manager 
What can I do for you  John  
 
Student 
Well  I work week nights  except for Friday  I was wondering if I could switch from working the dinner service to working at lunch  
 
Manager 
That s going to be a problem  I am afraid we don t have any openings at lunch time  A lot of students want to work then  so it is really rare for us to have an open spot at that time of day  
 
Student 
Oh  you see  I have joined this group  the University Jazz Band  and the band s practice time is right around dinner time  You know  it is so hard to get into this group  I must have auditioned like ten times since I have been at the school  so I am     Anyway  so I was really hoping to have the dinner hour free so I can go to practice  
 
Manager 
Well  we do have other open times  like breakfast  
 
Student 
Eh  that won t work  I am sorry  I mean that  I can t work that early  I have this very important music class I got to take  and it is like  first thing in the morning  


Manager 
Well  if you don t mind working in the kitchen  we ve got some pretty flexible hours for students doing food prep work  anything from early morning to late afternoon  
 
Student 
What s prep work  
 
Manager 
You prepare food for the cooks  You know  like cutting up vegetables for soup  or cleaning greens for salads  
 
Student 
Oh  that doesn t sound  I mean    Being a waiter  I get to see a lot of the professors  like in a different light  we joke around a little you know  In the classroom  they always have to be pretty formal  but     
 
Manager 
Well  the money is no different since we pay students the same amount for any of the jobs here in food service  so it s up to you  
 
Student 
Oh  man  I always thought that sacrificing for my art  that d mean working long hours as a musician for  like  no money  I didn t think it d mean  peeling carrots  
 
Manager 
Let me see  I am offering you something that has the hours you want  it is right here on campus  and you make as much money as you did being a waiter  quite a sacrifice  
 
Student 
I am sorry  I know you are just trying to help  I guess I should look into the food prep 
job 


Manager 
Ok  then  I ll tell the kitchen manager that you will stop by tomorrow to talk about the job and schedule your hours  And I will let the dining hall manager know that he needs to find a new waiter for the evening  
 
Student 
Oh  ok  I guess that  s it  Thanks  Mrs  Hanson  
 
TPO 17 Lecture 3 History Ancient Egyptian Calendar  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a history class  The professor has been discussing ancient 
Egypt  
 
Professor 
Ok  so one of the challenges that faced ancient civilizations like Egypt was timekeeping  calendars  When you have to grow food for whole cities of people  it is important to plant your crops at the right time  And when you start having financial obligations  rents  taxes  you have to keep track of how often you pay  
 
So today we will look at how the Egyptians addressed these problems  In fact  they ended up using two calendars  one to keep track of the natural world  or their agriculture concerns  and another one  that was used to keep track of the business functions of the Kingdom  So let s take a look at the hows and whys of one ancient Egyptian calendar system  starting with the Nile River  
 
Why the Nile  Well  there s no other way to put it  Egyptian life basically revolved around the mysterious rise and fall of the river  The success of their agriculture system depended upon them knowing when the river would change  So  naturally  their first calendar was divided up into three seasons  each based on the river  s changes  inundation  subsidence and harvest  
 
The first season was the flooding  or inundation  when the Nile valley was essentially submerged in water for a few months or so  And afterwards during the season of subsidence  the water would subside  or recede  revealing a new layer of fertile black silt and allowing for the planting of various crops  And finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley would produce crops  such as wheat  barley  fruit  all ready to harvest  Ok  so it was important to the ancient Egyptians to know when their Nile based seasons would occur  their way of life depended upon it  
 
Now  the way they used to count time was based on the phases of the moon  which  regularly and predictably  goes through a cycle  starting with a new moon  then to a full moon  and back again to the new moon  Now this cycle wes then used to determine the length of their month  So  um  one lunar cycle was one Egyptian month  and about four of the months would constitute a season  Now  12 of these months was an approximately 354 day year  So they had a 354 day agricultural calendar that was designed to help them determine when the Nile would inunadate the land  
 
Well  of course it had to be more complicated than that  The average amount of time between floodings wasn t actually 354 days  I mean  although it varies  the average was clearly longer than 354 days  So how did they keep this short calendar in step with the actual flooding of the Nile  
 
Well  their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star  Sirius  would disappear  Actually  it d be hidden in the glare of the Sun  And then  a couple of months later  one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn  Sirius would reappear  And it happened regularly  about every 365 days  Even more significantly  the reappearance of Sirius would occur around the same time as the Nile s flooding  And this annual event is called a heliacal rising4
  
 
The heliacal rising was a fair indicator of when the Nile would flood  The next new moon  after the heliacal rising of Sirius  which happened in the last month of the calendar year  marked the New Year  And because the ancient Egyptians were using the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising  some years ended up having 12 lunar months  while others had 13 lunar calender months  if Sirius didn t rise in the 12th month  
 
Even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuated  with some years having 12 months and others having 13  it ended up being much more reliable than it was before  They continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of Sirius  ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons  This new calendar was ideal  because  well  
it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have 
traditional religious festivals  So  that was their first calendar  
 
But was it any way to run a government  They didn t think so  For administrative purposes  it was very inconvenient to have years of different lengths  So another calendar was introduced  an administrative one  Probably soon after 3 000 BC  they declared a 365 day year  with 12 months per year  with exactly 30 days each month  with an extra 5 days at the end of each year  This administrative calendar existed alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depended on the heliacal rising of Sirius  This administrative calendar was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other things that had to be paid on time  Over time  the calendar got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the Nile  but for bureaucratic purposes  they didn t mind  
 
TPO 17 Lecture 4 Biology Octopus  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class  
 
Professor 
Ok  now I want to talk about an animal that has a fascinating set of defense mechanisms  And that s the octopus  one of the unusual creatures that live in the sea  The octopus is prey to many species  including humans  so how does it escape its predators  Well  let me back up here a second  Anyone ever heard of Proteous  Proteus was a 

God in Greek mythology who could change form  He could make himself look like a lion or a stone or a tree  anything you wanted  and he could go through a whole series of changes very quickly  Well  the octopus is the real world version of Proteus  Just like Proteus  the octopus can go through all kinds of incredible transformations  And it does this in three ways  by changing color  by changing its texture  and by changing its size and shape  For me  the most fascinating transformation is when it changes its color  It s a normal skin color  the one it generally presents  is either red or brown or even grey  and it  s speckled with dark spots  But when it wants to blend in with its environment to hide from its enemies  it can take on the color of its immediate surroundings  the ocean floor  a rock  a piece of coral  whatever  Charles  
 
Student 
Do we know how that works  I mean  how they change colors  
 
Professor 
Well  we know that the reaction that takes place is not chemical in nature  The color changes are executed by two different kinds of cells in the octopus   skin  mainly by color cells on the skin s surface call chromatophores
5
  
Chromatophores consist of tiny sacks filled with color dye  There might be a couple hundred of these color sacks per square millimeter of the octopus   skin  and depending on the species  they can come in as many as five different colors  Each one of these sacks is controlled by muscles  If the muscles are relaxed  the sack shrinks  and all you see is a little white point  But if the muscle s contract  then the sack expands  and you can see the colors  And by expanding different combinations

Student 
And just with various combinations of those five colors  they can recreate any color in their environment  
Professor 
Well  they can no doubt create a lot with just those five colors  but you are right  maybe they can t mimic every color around them  so that s where the second kind of cell comes in  
Just below the chromatophores is a layer of cells that reflect light from the environment  and these cells help the octopus create a precise match with the colors that surround them  The colors from the color sacks are supplemented with colors that are reflected from the environment  and that  s how they are able to mimic colors with such precision  So  that s how octopus mimic colors  
But they don t just mimic the colors in their environment  they can also mimic the texture of objects in their environment  They have these little projections on their skin that allow them to resemble various textures  The projections are called 
papillae6
  If the octopus wants to have a rough texture  it raises the papillae  If it wants to have a smooth texture  it flattens out the papillae  so it can acquire a smooth texture to blend in with the sandy bottom of the sea  So the octopus has the ability to mimic both the color and the texture of its environment  And it s truly amazing how well it can blend in with its surroundings  You can easily swim within a few feet of an octopus and never see it  
 
Student 
I read that they often hide from predators by squirting out a cloud of ink  or 
something like that  
 
Professor 
Yes  The octopus can release a cloud of ink if it feels threatened  But it doesn t hide behind it  as is generally believed  Um  the ink cloud is     it serves to distract a predator while the octopus makes its escape  Um  now there s a third way that octopus can transform themselves to blend in with or mimic their environment  and that s by changing their shape and size  well  at least their apparent size  The muscular system of the octopus enables it to be very flexible to assume all sorts of shapes and postures  So it can contract into the shape of a little round stone  and sit perfectly still on the seafloor  Or it can nestle up in the middle of a plant and take the shape of one of the leaves  Even Proteus would be impressed  I think

A  Hi   I hope you can help me   I just transferred from Northeastern State University near Chicago 
B  Well welcome to Central University  But Chicago is such a great city  Why did you leave  
A  Everyone asks that  It s my hometown  And it was sure convenient to go to a school nearby  But Northeastern is still fairly small  And it doesn t have the program I m interested in  I want to major in international studies  And the only program int the State is here 
A  We do have a great program  Well how did you get interested in international studies  
B  My family hosted a few foreign exchange students while I was growing up  Then I took part in an international summer program after I graduated from high school  I thought I really I like meeting people from all over  getting to know them 
A  OH  Ok  And that led you to our program  Right now though I think you are looking for a job 
B  Yeah  a part time job on campus  I thought I d save money  being away from the big city  But it doesn t seem to be working that way  Anyway I m not having much luck  
A  I m not surprised  Most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester  What work experience have you had 
B  Well  I worked in the university library last year  But I already checked at the library here  They said their remaining positions were for work study students getting financial aid  I ve never run into that before  
A  Well  I guess each school has its own policies  Uh  we really don t have much right now  You might be better  If you really want something  how are your computer skills 
B  About average I d say  I helped teach some of the basic computer classes  Northeastern offers for new users  if that helps any 
A  OK  The technology support department needs people to work its helpdesk  It s basically a customer service job  answering questions  helping people solve their computer problems  give you a chance to develop your people skills  
B  Something every diplomat needs  But is there some problem  I mean why is the job still open 
A  Well  they have extended hours  from 6am to 2am every day  So they need a large staff  But right now they only need people early mornings  late nights  and weekends  You d probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot  On the bright side you ll probably be able to get some studying done between calls  At least it could be a start and then you can try for better hours next semester  
B  Um  I see why the hours might be a problem  But I guess I can t afford to be too picky if I want a job  Still maybe we can work something out  
TPO 18 Lecture 1 Astronomy

We are going to start a study of sunspots today  and I think you ll find it rather interesting  Now I m going to assume that you know that sunspots  in the most basic terms  are dark spots on the Sun s surface  That will do for now  The ancient Chinese were the first to record observations of sunspots as early as the year 165  When later European astronomers wrote about sunspots  they didn t believe that the spots were actually on the Sun  That s because of their belief at the time that the heavenly bodies  the Sun  Moon  Stars  and Planets  were perfect  without any flaws or blemishes  So the opinion was the spots were actually something else  like shadows of planets crossing the Sun s face  And this was the thinking of European astronomers until the introduction of the telescope  which brings us to our old friend  Galileo  In the early 1600s  based on his observations of sunspots  Galileo proposed a new hypothesis  He pointed out that the shape of sunspots  well  the sunspots weren t circular  If they were shadows of the planets  they would be circular  right  So that was a problem for the prevailing view  And he also noticed that the shape of the sunspots changed as they seemed to move across the Sun s surface  Maybe a particular sunspot was sort of square  then later it would become more lopsided  then later something else  So there is another problem with the shadow hypothesis  because the shape of a planet doesn t change  What Galileo proposed was that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun  but he didn t know what kind of feature  He proposed that they might be clouds in the atmosphere  the solar atmosphere  especially because they seemed to change shape and there was no predicting the changes  at least nothing Galileo could figure out  That random shape changing would be consistent with the spots being clouds  Over the next couple hundred years  a lot of hypotheses were tossed around  The spots were mountains or holes in the solar atmosphere through which the dark surface of the Sun could be seen  Then in 1843  astronomer named Heinrich Schwa be made an interesting claim  Trobe had been watching the Sun every day that it was visible for 17 years  looking for evidence of a new planet  And he started keeping tracks of sunspots  mapping them  so he wouldn t confuse them  so he wouldn t confuse them with any potential new planet  In the end  there was no planet  but there was evidence that the number of sunspots increased and decreased in a pattern  a pattern that began repeating after 10 years  and that was a huge breakthrough  Another astronomer named Wolf kept track of the Sun for an even longer period  40 years actually  So Wolf did 40 years of research  and Trobe did 17 years of research  I think there is a lesson there  Anyway  Wolf went though all records from various observatories in Europe and put together a history of sunspot observations going back about 100 years  From this information  he was able to confirm the existence of a pattern  a repeating cycle but Wolf detected an 11 year cycles  Dose that sound familiar to anyone  No  Well  geomagnetic activity  the natural variations in Earth s magnetic field  it fluctuates in 11 year cycles  Well  we ll cover this later in this semester  but for now  well  scientists in the late 19th century were aware of geomagnetic cycles  so when they heard that the sunspots  cycle was also 11 years  well  they just had to find out what was going on  Suddenly  everyone was doing studies of the possible relationship between the Sun and the Earth  Did the sunspots cause the geomagnetic fields or did the geomagnetic fields cause the sunspots  Or is there some other thing that caused both  And astronomers did eventually figure out what sunspots had to do with magnetic fields  And the fact that sunspots are magnetic fields accounts for their dark appearance  That s because magnetic fields reduce the pressure exerted on the gases inside of them  making the spots cooler than the rest of the Sun s surface  And since they are cooler  they are darker 

TPO 18 Lecture 2 Art History

A  Today we ll continue our examination of ancient Roman sculpture  We ve already looked at portrait sculpture which are busts created to commemorate people who had died  and we ve looked at relief sculpture  or sculpting on walls  And today we ll look at yet another category of sculpture made copies of famous Greek sculptures 
B  Why did they do that 
A  Well no one knows for sure  You see  in the late 4th century B C   the Romans began a campaign to expand the Roman Empire  and in 300 years they had conquered most of the Mediterranean area and parts of Europe  You know the saying  copies  Roman sculptors often  To the victor belong the spoils   Well  the Roman army returned to Rome with many works of Greek art  It s probably fair to say that the Romans were impressed be Greek art and culture and they began making copies of the Greek statues  Now the dominant view in traditional art his that Roman artists lacked creativity and skill especially compared to the Greek artists who came before them  Essentially  the traditional view  a view that s been prevalent for over 250 years  is that the Romans copied Greek sculptures because they couldn t create sculpture of their own  But finally some contemporary art historians have challenged this view  One is Elaine Gazda   Gazda says that there might be other reasons that Romans made copies  She wasn t convinced that it was because of a lack of creativity  Can anyone think of another possible reason  Well maybe they just admired these sculptures  You know  they liked the way they looked  Yes  That s one of Gazda s points  Another is that while nowadays reproduction is easy  it was not so easy in Roman times  Copying statues required a lot of skill  time and effort  So Gazda hypothesizes that copying didn t indicate a lack of artistic imagination or skill on the part of Roman artists  but rather the Romans made copies because they admired Greek sculpture  Classical Greek statues represented an idealization of the human body and were considered quite beautiful at the time  Gazda also believes that it s been a mistake to dismiss the Roman copies as  well  copies for copy s sake and not to consider the Roman function and meaning of the statues 
B  What do you mean the Roman function  Weren t they just for decoration 
A  Well  not necessarily  Under the Emperor Augustus at the height of the Roman Empire  portrait statues were sent throughout the empire  They were supposed to communicate specific ideas about the emperor and the imperial family and to help inhabitants of the conquered areas become familiar with the Roman coins were also distributed throughout the empire  Anybody care to guess what was on them 
 The emperor s face  That s right  The coins were easy to distribute and they allowed people to see the emperor or at least his likes and served as an additional reminder to let them know  well  who was in charge  And the images helped people become familiar with the emperor  Statues of him in different roles were sent all over the empire  Now  actually some Roman sculptures were original but others were exact copies of Greek statues and some Roman sculptures were combinations of some sort  Some combined more than one Greek statue and others combined a Greek god or an athlete with a Roman s head  At the time of Julius Caesar  I wasn t uncommon to create statues that had the body of a god and the head of an emperor  And the Romans were clever  What they did was they made plaster casts from molds of the sculptures  Then they shipped these plaster casts to workshops all over the empire  where they were replicated in marble or bronze  And on some statues the heads were removable  They could put an emperor s head on different bodies  showing him doing different things  And then later when then time came they could even use the head of the next emperor on the same body

A  Well  I m glad you redid your outline  I fed a few comments  but nothing you have to act on  It s in good enough shape for you to start writing you paper  
B  Thanks  At first I was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time  
A  Well  especially with a challenging topic like yours  factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline  There s just so much history to consider  you could get lost without a solid outline  So did you have a question 
B  Yeah  it s about…you mentioned needing volunteers for a research study 
A  Yep  it s not my study  It s my colleague s in the marketing department  She needs people to watch various new TV programs that haven t been broadcast yet  then indicate on a survey whether they liked it  why  if they d watch another episode  It d be kind of fun plus participants get a $50 gift certificate  
B  Wow  well I like the sound of that  But…so they are trying to predict if the shows are gonna succeed or fail  right  based on students  opinions  Why would they care what we think  
A  Hey  don t sell yourself short  People your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on television  The study is sponsored by a TV network  If enough students don t like the show  the network may actually reconsider putting it on the air 
B  OK  well  how do I sign up 
A  You just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot  although it looks like the only times left are next Monday morning and Thursday evening 
B  Oh  well  I have marketing and economics Monday mornings and Thursday 
A  OH  you are taking the marketing class  Who s teaching it 
B  It s Professor Largin   Intro to Marketing  Hr hasn t mentioned the study though 
A  Oh  well  the marketing department s pretty big  I happen to be friends with a woman who is doing the TV study  Ok  well  we don t want you missing class  How s Thursday 
B  Oh  I work from 5 till 9 that night  Hmm  no flexibility with your schedule  Where do you work 
A  Oh  I like Fox s  I eat there every week  Maybe you could switch shifts with someone 
B  I m still in training  And the only night my trainer works is Thursday  Look 
A  I know the owners there really well  Why don t you let me give them a call and explain the situation 
B  OK  It d be cool to be part of a real research study  And the gift certificate wouldn t hurt either 

TPO 18 Lecture 3 European History

In order to really study the social history of the Middle Ages  you have to understand the role of spices  Now  this might sound a little spurring  even a little strange  But what seem like little things now were back then actually rather big things  So first let s define what a spice is  Technically speaking  a spice is part of an aromatic plant that is not a leaf or herb  Spices can come from tree bark like cinnamon  plant roots like ginger  flower buds like cloves  And in the Middle Ages  Europeans were familiar with lots of different spices  most important being pepper  cloves  ginger  cinnamon  maize and nutmeg  These spices literarily dominated the way Europeans lived for centuries  how they traded and even how they used their imaginations  So why this medieval fascination with spices  We can boil it down to there general ideas briefly  One was cost and rarity  Uh two was exotic taste and fragrance  And third  mysterious origins and kinds of mythical status  Now for cost and rarity  spices aren t native to Europe and they had to be imported  Spices only grew in the East Indies and of course transportation costs were incredibly valuable even from the very beginning  Here is an example  In 408 AD  the Gothic General who captured Rome demanded payment  He wanted 5000 pounds of gold among other things but he also wanted 3000 pounds of pepper  Maybe that would give you an idea of exactly where pepper stood at the time  By the Middle Ages  spices were regarded as so important and expensive they were used in diplomacy  as gifts by heads of state and ambassadors  Now for the taste  The diet then was relatively bland  compared to today s  There wasn t much variety  Especially the aristocracy who tended to eat a lot of meat  they were always looking for new ways to prepare it  new sources  new tastes and this is where spices came in  Now  this is a good point to mention one of the biggest myths about spices  It s commonly said that medieval Europeans wanted spices to cover up the taste of spoiled meat  But this isn t really true  Anyone who had to worry about spoiled meat couldn t afford spices in the first place  If you could afford spices  you could definitely afford fresh meat  We also have evidence that various medieval markets employed a kind of police to make sure that people did not sell spoiled food  and if you were caught doing it  you were subject to various fines  humiliating public punishments  So what actually was true was this  In order to have meat for the winter  people would preserve it in salt  not a spice  Spices actually aren t very effective as preservatives  And throughout winter  they would eat salted meat  but the taste of the stuff could grow really boring and depressing after a while  So the cook started looking for new ways to improve the taste and spices were the answer  which brings us to mysterious origins and mythical status  Now the ancient Romans had a thriving spice trade and they sent their ships to the east and back  But when Rome collapsed in the fifth century and the Middle Ages began  direct trade stopped  and so did that kind of hands on knowledge of travel and geography  Spices now came by way of the trade routes with lots of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer  So these spices took on an air of mystery  Their origins were shrouded in exotic travels  They had the allure of the unknown  of wild places  Myths grew up of fantasy lands  magical faraway places made entirely of food and spices  And to that  spices themselves had always been considered special or magical not just for eating and this was already true in the ancient world where legends about spices were abundant  Spices inspired the medieval imagination  They were used as medicines to ward off diseases  and mixed into perfumes  incent  They were used in religious rituals for thousands of years  They took on a life of their own and they inspired the medieval imagination  spurred on the age of discovery in the 145th and 16th centuries  When famous explorers like Columbus and da Gama and Magellan left Europe in their ships  they weren t looking for a new world   they were looking for spices  And we know what important historical repercussions some of those voyages had  

TPO 18 Lecture 4 Biology

A：Well  it s finally looking like spring is arriving  The last of the winter snow would be melting away in a few days  So before we close today  I thought I d mention a biological event that s a part of the transition from winter to spring  something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience  There is a small creature that lives in this area  you ve probably seen it  It s the North American wood frog  Now the wood frog s not that easy tosspot since it stays pretty to close to the ground  under leaves and things and it blends in really well with its background as you can see  But they are worth the effort because they do something very unusual  something you might not have even thought possible  OK North American wood frogs live over a very broad territory or range  They re found all over the northeastern United States and all through Canada and Alaska  even inside the Arctic Circle  No other frog is able to live that far and north  But wherever they live  once the weather starts to turn cold and the temperature starts to drop below freezing  as soon as the frog even touches an ice crystal or a bit of frozen ground  well  it begins to freeze  Yeah   yes to me  You look a little bit taken aback 
B  Wait  you mean it s still alive but it freezes  solid  
A  Well  almost  Ice forms in all the spaces outside the cells but never within a cell  
B  But… then how does its heart beat  
A  It doesn t  
B  But…then how could it……  
A  You are gonna do such a thing  Well  that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological response inside the frog  That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body  so the middle part of the frog  its internal organs  its heart  lungs  liver  these start getting drier and drier while the water that s being pulled away is forming a puddle around the organs just underneath the skin  And then that puddle of water starts to freeze  OK  up to known  the frog s heart is still beating  right  Slower and slower but…and in those last few hours before it freezes  it distributes glucose  a blood sugar throughout its body  its circulatory system  sort of acts like an an antifreeze 
B  A solution of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter 
A  Well  you tell me  In frogs  the extra glucose makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to freeze  So the cells stay just slightly wet  enough so that they can survive the winter  Then after that  the heart stops beating altogether  So is that the same  
B  I don t really know  but how long dose it stay that way 
A  Well  it could be days or months  all winter in fact but umm  see the heart really doesn t need to do any pumping now because the blood is frozen too  
B  I just  I guess I just don t see how it isn t  you know  clinically dead 
A  Well  that s the amazing thing and how it revives is pretty amazing too  After months without a heartbeat  spring time came around again  the earth starts to warm up and suddenly one day  ping  a pulse  followed by another one  then another until maybe ten  twelve hours later  the animal is fully recovered  
B  And does the thawing process have some kind of trigger as well  
A  Well  we are not sure actually  the clearer thing is even though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside  its inside thaw out first  the heart and brain and everything  But somehow it all just happens that way every spring  
B  But after they thaw does it affect them like their lifespan 
A  Well  hmm  we really don t know a lot about how long a wood frog normally lives  probably just a few years but there is no evidence its longevity  It does have some other impacts though  In studies  we found that when it comes to reproduction  freezing diminishes the mating performance of males  After they ve been frozen and thawed of course  they don t seem quite as vocal  They move slower and they seem to have a harder time recognizing a potential mate  So if the male frog could manage not to go through this freezing cycle  he d probably have more success in mating

Student 
Hi  professor Handerson  That was a really interesting lecture in class today  
 
Professor 
Thanks  Tom  Yeah  animals  use of deception  ways they play tricks on other animals  that s a fascinating area  
One we are really just starting to understand  
 
Student 
Yeah  you know  selective adaptations over time are one thing  Oh  like  non poisonous butterflies  that have 
come to look like poisonous ones  But the idea that animals of the same species intentionally deceive each other  
I have never heard that before  
 
Professor 
Right  like  there are male frogs who lower their voices and end up sounding bigger than they really are  
 
Student 
So they do that to keep other frogs from invading their territory   
 
Professor 
Right  bigger frogs have deeper voices  so if a smaller frog can imitate that deep voice  Well

Yeah  I can see how that might do the trick  But  anyway  what I wanted to ask was  when you started talking 
about game theory  Well  I know a little bit about it  but I am not clear about its use in biology  
 
Professor
3 
Yeah  it is fairly new to biology  Basically  it uses math to predict what an individual would do under certain 
circumstances  But for example  a business sells  oh computer  say  and they want to sell their computers to a big 
university  But there is another company bidding too  So  what should they do  
 
Student 
Well  try to offer the lowest price so they can compete  but still make money  
 
Professor 
Right  they are competing  like a game  like the frogs  There are risks with pricing too high  the other company 
might get the sale  there is also the number and types of computers to consider  Each company has to find a 
balance between the cost and benefits  Well  game theory creates mathematical models that analyze different 
conditions like this to predict outcomes  
 
Student 
Ok  I get that  But how does it apply to animals   
 
Professor 
Well  you know  if you are interested in this topic  it would be perfect for your term paper  
 
Student 
The literature review   
 
Professor 
Yeah  find three journal articles about this or another topic that interests you and discuss them  If there is a 
conflict in the conclusions or something  that would be important to discuss  
 
Student 
Well  from what I have looked at dealing with game theory  I can t say I understand much of the statistics end  
 
Professor 
Well  I can point you to some that presents fairly basic studies  that don t assume much background knowledge  
You ll just need to answer a few specific questions  What was the researchers  hypothesis  What did they want to find out  And how did they conduct their research  An then the conclusions they came to  Learning to 
interpret these statistics will come later  TPO 19 Lecture 1 Linguistics Proto Indo European  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class  
 
Professor 
All right  so far we have been looking at some of the core areas of linguistics  like syntax  phonology  semantics  
and these are things that we can study by looking at one language at a time  how sounds  and words  and 
sentences work in a given language  But the branch of historical linguistics  involves the comparison of several 
different languages  or the comparison of different stages of a single language  
 
Now  if you are comparing different languages  and you notice that they have a lot in common  Maybe they have 
similar sounds and words that correspond to one another that have the same meaning and that sound similar  
 
Let s use a real world example  In the 18th century  scholars who have studied the ancient languages  Sanskrit  Latin and Greek  noticed that these three languages had many similarities  And there might be several reasons why languages such as these had so much in common  Maybe it happened by chance  maybe one language was heavily influenced by borrowed words from the other  Or maybe  maybe the languages developed from the same source language long ago  that is  maybe they are genetically related  that was what happened with Sanskrit  Latin and Greek  These languages had so many similarities that it was concluded that they must have all come from the same source  And talk about important discoveries in linguistics  this was certainly one of them  
 
The scholars referred to that source language as Proto Indo European  Proto Indo European is a reconstructed language  Meaning  it is what linguists concluded a parent language of Sanskrit  Latin and Greek would have to be like  And Proto Indo European branched out into other languages  which evolved into others  so in the end  many languages spoken all over the world today can trace their ancestry back to one language  Proto Indo European  which was spoken several thousand years ago  
 
Now  one way of representing the evolution of languages  showing the way languages are related to each other  is with the family tree model  Like a family tree that you might use to trace back through generations of ancestors  only it s showing a family of genetically related languages instead of people  A tree model for a language family starts with one language  which we call a mother language  for example  Proto Indo European  The mother language  is the line on the top of this diagram  over time  it branches off into new daughter languages  which branch into daughter languages of their own  and languages that have the same source  the same mother  are called sisters  they share a lot of characteristics  and this went on until we are looking at a big upside down tree languages like this  It is incomplete of course  just to give you an idea  So that s the family tree model  basically  

Now  the tree model is a convenient way of representing the development of a language family and of showing how closely related two of more languages are  But it is obviously very simplified  having a whole language represented by just one branch on a tree doesn t really do justice to all the variations within that language  You know  Spanish that spoken in Spain isn t exactly the same as Spanish that is spoken in Mexico  for example  
 
Another issue is that languages evolve very gradually  but the tree model makes it look like they evolve over night like there was a distinct moment in time when a mother language clearly broke off into daughter languages  But it seems to me it probably wasn t quite like that  
 
TPO 19 Lecture 2 Astronomy Radio Astronomy & Optical Astronomy  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class  
 
Professor 
So how many of you have seen the Milky Way  the Milky Galaxy in the sky  You  you have  
 
Student 
Yeah  I was camping  and there was no moon that night  it was super dark  
 
Professor 
Anybody else  Not too many  Isn t that strange that the Milky Way is the galaxy that the planet earth is in  and most of us have never seen it  Now  what s the problem here  
 
Student 
Light pollution  right  From street lights and stuff     
 
Professor 
Yes  Especially unshielded street light  you know  ones that aren t pointed downward  Now  here s an irony  the buiding we are in now  the astronomy building not far from our observatory  has unshielded lights  
 
Student 
So the problem is pretty widespread  
 
Professor 
It is basically beyond control  as far as expecting to view the night sky anywhere near city  I mean  I have lived around here my whole life  And I have never seen the Milky Way within city limits  and I probably never will  There is a price for progress  eh  But let s think beyond light pollution  that s only one kind of a technological advance that has interfered with astronomical research  

Can anyone think of another  No  Ok  let s look at it this way  we don t only gain information by looking at the stars  for the past 70 years or so  we have also used radio astronomy1   which lets us study radio waves from the sky  
 
Student 
How can you observe radio waves  I mean  tell anything about the stars from that  
 
Professor 
Well  in optical astronomy  using a telescope and observing the stars that way  we rely on visible light waves  What we are seeing from earth is actually electromagnetic radiation that s coming from stars  And just one part of it is visible light  But there are problems with that  When photons2 and light waves hit objects in our atmosphere  water droplets  oxygen and nitrogen molecules  dust particles and so on  These objects are illuminated  they are lit up  and those things are also being lit by all our street lights  by the moon  all these ambient light  And on top of that  when that visible radiation bounces off those molecules  it scatters in all directions  And well  light from stars  even nearby in our own galaxy  doesn t stand a chance against that  Basically the light bouncing off all these objects close to earth is brighter than what s coming from the stars  

Now  radio waves are electromagnetic radiation that we can t see  Nearly all astronomical objects in space emit radio waves  whether nearby stars  objects in far away galaxies  they all give off radio waves  And unlike visible light waves  these radio waves can get through the various gases and dusts in space  and through our own earth s atmosphere comparatively easily  
 
Student 
Ok  then we might as well give up on optical astronomy and go with radio astronomy  
 
Professor 
Well  the thing is  with the radio astronomy  you can t just set up a telescope in you backyard and observe stars  
One problem is that radio waves from these far away objects  even though they can get through  are extremely 
faint  So we need to use radio telescopes  specially designed to receive these waves and then  well  we can use 
computers to create pictures based on the information we receive  
 
Student 
That sounds cool  So  how do they do that 

Professor 
Well  it is kind of like the same way a satellite dish3
 receives its signal  if you are familiar with that  But radio 
telescopes are sometimes grouped together  is the same effect as having one big telescope to increase radio 
wave gathering power  And they use electronics  quite sophisticated  Yeah  it is neat how they do it  but for now 
why don t we just stick with what we can learn from it  Some very important discoveries have been made by this 
technology  especially you consider that some objects in space give off radio waves but don t emit any light  We 
have trouble discovering those sorts of bodies  much less studying them using just optical telescopes  
 
Student 
Well  If the radio waves are so good at getting through the universe  what s the problem  
 
Professor 
Well  answer this  How come people have to turn off their cell phones and all our electronic devices when an 
airplane is about to take off  
 
Student 
The phones interfere with the radio communication at the airport  right  
 
Student 
Oh  so our radio waves here on earth interfere with the waves from space  
 
Professor 
Yes  signal from radios  cell phones  TV stations  remote controls  you name it  All these things cause interference  
We don t think about that as often as we think about light pollution  But all those electrical gauges pollute the 
skies  just in a different way  
 
TPO 19 Conversation 2 

Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of the student cafeteria  
 
Student 
Hi  I    I am sorry to interrupt  could I ask you a few questions  
 
Director 
Sure  but if it is about you meal plan  you ll need to go to Room 45  just down the hall  
 
Student 
Eh  no  I am OK with my meal plan  I am actually here about the food in the student cafeteria  
 
Director 
Oh  we do feed a lot of students  so we can t always honor individual requests  I am sure you understand  
 
Student 
Of course  It is just that I am a little concerned  I mean  a lot of us are  that a lot of the food you serve isn t really that healthy  Like there are so many deep fried foods  
 
Director 
As a matter of fact  we recently changed the type of oil we use in our fryer   It is the healthiest available  And would you believe that at least ten students have already complaint that their french fries and fried chicken don t taste as good since we switched  
 
Student 
Oh  I try not to eat too many fried foods anyway  I am just aware that  eh   You see  I used to work in a natural food store  They had all these literature4 advising people to eat fresh organic growing food  Working there really open my eyes  

Director 
Did you come to the organic food festival we had to celebrate Earth Day  
 
Student 
Oh  sorry  I must have missed that  
 
Director 
We served only certified organic food  most of which was from local farms  It is not something we can afford to do on a daily basis  and there aren t too many organic farms around here  But sometime the produce we offer is organically grown  It depends on the season and the prices of course  
 
Student 
That s good to know  I like the fact that organic farms don t use chemical pesticides or anything that can pollute the soil or the water  
 
Director 
I do too  But let me ask you this  Is it better to buy locally grown produce that is not certified as organic or is it better to get organically grown fruits and vegetables that must be trucked in from California  three thousand mile away  What about fossil fuels burned by the trucks  engine  Plus the expense of shipping food across long distances  And nutritionally speaking  an apple is an apple however it is grown  
 
Student 
I see your point  It is not so clear cut  
 
Director 
Why don t you visit our cafeteria s website  We list all our food suppliers  You know  where we buy the food that we serve  And the site also suggests ways to make your overall diet a healthy one  You can also find some charts listing fat and calorie content for different types of seafood  meat and the other major food groups  
 
Student 
I didn t realize you thought about all these things so carefully  I just noticed the high calorie food in the cafeteria  

Director 
Well  we have to give choices so everyone is satisfied  But if you wish to pursue this further  I suggest that you talk to my boss  
 
Student 
That s OK  seems like you are doing what you can  TPO 19 Lecture 3 Marine Biology Plant Life in Salt Marshes  

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class  
 
Professor 
Ok  today we are going to continue our discussion of plant life in coastal salt marshes
5 of North America  Salt marshes are among the least inviting environments for plants  The water is salty  there is little shade and the ocean tide comes in and out  constantly flooding the marsh  so the variety of plants found in salt marshes is limited  but there is a plant genus that thrives there  the Spartina  In fact  the Spartina genus is the dominant plant found in salt marshes  You can find one type of the Spartina  Saltmarsh Cordgrass  growing in low marsh areas  In higher marsh areas  you are likely to find a Spartina commonly called Salt meadow Hay  So how is the Spartina able to survive in an environment that would kill most plants  well  it is because salt marsh grasses have found ways to adapt to the conditions there  

First of all  they are able to withstand highly saline conditions  One really interesting adaptation is the ability to reverse the process of osmosis6

  Typically  the process of osmosis works    Well  when water moves through the wall of a plant cell  it will move from the side containing water with the lowest amount of salt into the side containing the highest amount of salt  so imagine what would happen if a typical plant suddenly found itself in salt water  the water contained in the plant cells  that is water with very little salt would be drawn out toward the seawater  water with a lot of salt  So you can see the fresh water contained in the plant will be removed and the plant will quickly lose all its water and dehydrate  But what about the Spartinas  well  they allow a certain amount of salt to enter their cells  bringing the salt content of the water within the plant  to a slightly higher concentration than that of the surrounding seawater  So instead of fresh water moving out of the plant cells  salt from the seawater enters  reverse osmosis  and this actually strengthens the cells  

Another adaptation to the salty environment is the ability to excrete excess salt back to the environment  That s why you might see a Spartina shimmering in the sunlight  What s reflecting the light is not salt from seawater that has evaporated  although that s a good guess  But it is actually the salt that came from within the plant  Pretty cool  eh  You can really impress your friends and family with that little   the next time you are in a salt marsh  

But coping with salt is not the only challenge for plants in the salt marsh  Soil there is dense and very low in oxygen  so Spartinas have air tubes  air enters through tiny openings on the leaves  the tubes provide direct pipe line for oxygen  carrying it down the leaves through the stems and into the roots  where it is needed  If you pull up a Spartina  you might even notice some reddish mud on some of the roots  this is caused by oxygen reacting with iron sulfide in the soil  and it produces iron oxide or rust  


Now  although the Spartinas have adapted several chemical and physical mechanisms that allow them to thrive in salt water and to feed oxygen to their roots  There is yet another aspect of the harsh environment that they have to adapt to  the force of tides and occasional violent storms  Wind and water are constantly crashing into these plants  So as you might have guessed  they have developed a means of solidly anchoring themselves into the soil  How  They have tough sort of underground stems called rhizome  rhizomes from one plant grow through the muddy soil and interlock with those of other nearby plants  the plants form a kind of colony  a community that will thrive and perish together  Because alone as single plants  they cannot survive  \

Of course the plants in these colonies also need tough resilient stems above the soil  stems that can bent a lot but not break as water constantly crashes into them  So in addition to the interlocking underground rhizomes  they have yet another adaptation  and it is     well  we are back to reverse osmosis again  by adjusting the osmotic pressure so that the cells are always fully inflated  the plant is able to withstand great pressure before snapping  so Spartinas may look like simple marsh grass  but they are really a wonder of chemistry  physics and structural engineering that allows them to survive and even thrive in an environment in which most plants will wilt7 and die within hours  
 
 
 TPO 19 Lecture 4 Art History Cecilia Beaux  

Narrator  Listen to part of a discussion in an art history class  
 
Professor  All right  let s continue our discussion of portrait artists portraitist  and portraiture  Who remembers any of the important points we made last time  Sandra  
 
Student  Well  artists have done portraits of people for centuries  of famous people and regular people  and most portraits convey the artists  personal vision  like their feelings and insights about a person  
 
Professor  Great  that s a crucial point  and I d like to explore that a little today  A great example of that  that vision in portraiture  is Cecilia Beaux  Cecilia Beaux was born in 1854  and after learning to paint and studying with several important artists of the time  Beaux became known as one of the best portrait painters in the United States  She was very successful  She even had portraits of the wife and children of Theodore Roosevelt  while he was president  Some did not get much more prestige than that  Now  those portraits also reflect the kind of subjects that Beaux tended to use  which were mostly women and children  For example  in her first major work  her subjects were      the painting featured her sister and her nephew  Yes  Mark  
 
Student 
Yeah  it just seems interesting  I was wondering if that was unusual to have a portrait artist who is a woman become so well known and successful in the 19th century  
 
Professor 
Great question  Yeah  she really stood out back in the 1800s  And today  she is still considered one of the greatest portrait painters of her time  male or female  In fact  she was the first full time female instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts  and she was a full member of the National Academy of Design  These are pretty important institutions  so  yeah  she definitely made headway for women artists  Ok  so let s look at one of her portraits now  this painting is called The Dreamer  It is one of my favorites  And I think it is especially characteristic of Beaux s work  So what you see here is a portrait of a close friend of Cecilia Beaux  So tell me what s the first thing that draws you to this painting  What catches your eye first  
 
Student 
Well  for me  it is her face and hands  I think they are really expressive  and also  they make the woman seem very contemplative  seems like she is thinking pretty seriously about something  
 
Student 
Yeah  her eyes kind of draw you in  But what strikes me is the contrasting colors  the white dress and the dark background  It kind of reminds me of that painting we discussed a few weeks ago  by    eh    John Singer Sargent  I think it was called MadameX  
 
Professor 
I agree  good point  Yes  Beaux had high regard for Sargent s work  And this is something  a technique you will find in both of their work  Ok  but the painting is called The Dreamer  What do you see is dreamlike about it  
 
Student 
Well  the background behind the woman is pretty vague  Like  maybe there is no real context  like no definite surroundings  especially compared to the woman herself  since she is so clear and well defined  
 
Professor 
Yes  the unclear background definitely contributes to that dreaminess  It is meant to show a sense of isolation I think  With the woman is deep in a daydream and not really aware of anything else  This painting shows how insightful Cecilia Beaux was as a portrait artist  Besides her excellent technical skills  like her use of brush strokes and color to make an impression  both respective come through  Her portraits reveal her own interpretation of her subject s state of mind  This is what it is all about  not just likenesses
8
  
Now  the undefined background also shows how Cecilia Beaux was influenced by the French Impressionists  who believed  like Beaux  in a personal rather than conventional approach to their subject matter  Beaux used some impressionist techniques and share much of their philosophy  but her style  it was all her own

Listen to a conversation between a student and a library employee  
Student 
Excuse me  I received a letter that I am supposed to return a book that I checked out back in September   it s called Modern Social Problems  But I am writing my senior thesis  so I thought I was allowed to keep the book for the whole academic year   
 
Librarian 
 
 
So you signed up for extended borrowing privileges  
Student 
Yeah  
Librarian 
And we are still asking you to bring the book back  
Student 
Uh huh  Do I really have to  
 
 
Librarian 
 
 
Well  let me check the computer   The title was     Modern Social Problems  
Student 
Yeah  
Librarian 
Eh    Ok  yeah  It s been recalled  You can keep it all year as long as no one else requests it  but someone else has  it looks like one of the professors in the sociology department  So you have to bring it back  You can check it out again when it is returned in a couple of weeks  

 
What if the person renews it  And I really need it right now  
Librarian 
All of it  Or is there a certain section or chapter you are working with  
 
 
Student 
 
 
Well  there s one chapter in particular I am working with  but why  
Librarian 
Well  we normally don t do this  but because of the circumstances we can photocopy up to one chapter for you  Why don t you do that for the one you are working with right now  And by the time you need the rest of the book  maybe it ll have been returned  
 
Student 
 
 
Oh  that would be great  
Librarian 
Do you have it with you  
Student 
Eh    no  it s in my dorm room  These are books I want to check out today  Is it OK if I bring that one by in a couple of days  
Librarian 
Actually  the due day is tomorrow  After that  there ll be a two dollar per day fine  But you need to return it today if you want to check out any books today  That s our policy  
 
Student 
Oh  I see  
Librarian 
Yeah  not a lot of people realize that  In fact  every semester we get a few students who would have their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven t returned books  They are allowed to use books only in the library  They are not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books  

 
That s not good  I guess I should head back to the dorm right now  
Librarian 
But before you go  what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks  Then the person who requested it won t be able to renew it  You ll get it back quickly  
Student 
I ll do that right now  

TPO20 Lecture1 Linguistics Gricean Maxims  
 
Narrator 
 
Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class  
 
Professor 
 
Ok  the conventions or assumptions that govern conversation  these may vary from one culture to another   but basically  for people to communicate  there is a     they have to follow certain rules  Like if I am talking with you and I start saying things that are not true  if you can t tell when I am lying and when I am telling the truth  well  we are not going to have a very satisfactory conversation  are we  Why  Because it violates one of the Gricean Maxims  that s a set of rules or maxims a philosopher name H P  Grice came up with in 1970s  One of these Gricean Maxims is    well  I ve already given you a hint  
Student 
Oh  you just can t go around telling lies  
 
Professor 
 
Right  or as Grice put it   Do not say what you believe to be false   That s one of Grice s Maxims of Quality as he called it  So that s pretty obvious  But there are others just as important  Like  eh    suppose you would ask me what time it was and I replied  my sister just got married    what would you think  
 
Student 
 
You are not really answering my question  
Professor 
No  I am not  am I  There is no connection at all  which feels wrong because you generally expect to find one  So one important maxim is simply  be relevant  And using the so called Maxim of Relevance we can infer things as well  or rather the speaker can imply things and the listener can make inferences  For instance  suppose you say you would really love to have a cup of coffee right now  and I say  there s a shop around the corner    Now  what can you infer from what I said  
 
Student 
 
Well  the shop sells coffee for one thing  

Professor 
 
Right  and that I believe it is open now  Because if I won t implying those things  my response would not be relevant  It d have no connection with what you said before  But according to the maxim  my response should be relevant to your statement  meaning  we should assume some connection between the statement and the response  And this maxim of relevance is quite efficient to use  Even if I don t spell out all the details  you can still make some useful logical inferences  namely  the shop is open and it sells coffee  If we actually have to explain all these details  conversations would move along pretty slowly  wouldn t they  
 
OK  then there s the maxims of manner  including things like be clear   and avoid ambiguity  
 
And another more interesting maxims is one of the so called maxims of quantity  quantities of information  that is  It says  to give as much as is required in the situation  So suppose you asked me what I did yesterday and I say  I went to the Art Museum   You would likely infer that I saw some works of art  Suppose  though  that I did not go inside the museum  I just walked up to it then left  Then I violated the quantity maxim by not giving enough information  So you can see how important implications are to our ability to carry on a conversation  
 
But there are times when people will violate these maxims on purpose  Let s say a boss is asked to write a letter of recommendation for a former employee seeking an engineering job  The letter he writes is quite brief  Something like  uh  Mr   X is polite and always dresses quite neatly  So what does this really mean  
 
Student 
 
 
Oh  I see  By not mentioning any important qualities related to the job  the boss is     like  implying that this is best that can be said about Mr   X that he is really not qualified  
 
Professor 
 
 
Exactly  It s a written letter not a conversation  but the principle is the same  The boss is conveying a negative impression of Mr   X without actually saying negative about him  So  by violating the maxims  we    eh    but     it can be a way to be subtle or polite  or to convey humor through sarcasm or irony  
 
Sometimes though people will violate maxims for another purpose  to deceive  Now  can you imagine who might do such a thing  
 
Student 
 
 
Some politicians  
Student 
Or advertisers 
 
Professor 
 
Right  Anyone who may see an advantage in implying certain things that are untrue without explicitly saying something untrue  They think  hey  don t blame us if our audience happens to draw inferences that are simply not true  So next time you see an advertisement saying some product could be up to 20% more effective  think of these maxims of quantity and relevance  and ask yourself what inferences you are being led to draw  Think  more effective than what exactly  And why do they use those little phrases  could be  and  up to   These claims give us a lot less information than they seem to  

TPO20 Lecture2 Environmental Science Interglacial Periods  
 
Narrator 
 
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class  

Professor 
 
I d like to take you back about 11 thousand years ago when Earth entered the latest interglacial period  Interglacial periods are  typically periods of time between Ice Ages  when the climate warms  and the glacial ice retreats for a time  before things cool off again and another Ice Age begins  And for over the past several million years  Earth s sort of default climate has actually been Ice Age  but we have experienced periodic regular thaws  and the last one  the one we are in now  started about 11 thousand years ago  
 
Now  the typical pattern for an interglacial period  and we have studied several  is that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gas actually reaches it    its peak  that is  there is the most carbon dioxide and methane gas  uh  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere just after the beginning of the interglacial period  And then  for reasons which are not entirely clear   the concentration of greenhouse gases gradually goes down  Now  the climate continues to warm for a while because there is a lag effect  But uh  gradually as the concentration of greenhouse gases goes down  Earth starts to cool again  and eventually you slip back into an Ice Age  
 
Um  however   for the latest interglacial period  the one we are in now  this pattern did not hold  that is  the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane dipped1 a little bit after  uh  uh  after peaking at the beginning  near the beginning of the interglacial period  but then it began to rise again  Um     What was different about this interglacial period than the other ones  
 
Well  one of the big differences is human activity  People began to raise crops and animals for food instead of hunting for them  This is the agricultural revolution  And it began to happen in the earliest stages about 11 thousand years ago  
 
Now  scientists have tended to regard     the     uh     agricultural revolution as a beneficiary of the     uh     fortuitous shift in climate  However   some new theories of climate  new theorists of climate have proposed that perhaps humanity was having an effect on the climate as far back as the beginnings of the agricultural revolution  When you grow crops and uh  pasture your animals   one of the things you do is you cut down the forests  If you cut down the forests  when you burn the trees for fuel and don t replace them with other trees  or when you just leave them to rot and don t allow other trees to grow  you end up with a lot more carbon in the form of carbon dioxide getting into the atmosphere  

Um     another gas associated with the spread of agriculture is methane  Methane forms in large concentration above wetlands  and as it turns out  the cultivation of certain grains creates vast areas of artificial wetlands  and probably drastically increases the amount of methane getting into the atmosphere  over and above what would be there  
 
So  um    agriculture  the     the spread of agriculture  you know we are talking over thousands of years  um    but this could very well had a profound effect on the composition of Earth s atmosphere  It s kind of ironic to think that absent that effect  it maybe that we would be heading into an Ice Age again  In fact  back in the 1970s  a lot of theorists were predicting that  you know  the climate would start to cool and we d slowly enter into the new Ice Age  And then they were puzzled as to why it didn t seem to be happening  
 
Umm    now  what are the implications for the future  Well  um    it is a little tricky  I mean  you could say  well  here is an example of     um     human activity  the agricultural revolution which actually was beneficial  we altered the climate for the better   perhaps  by preventing an Ice Age  But then industrialization  of course  has drastically increased the amount of carbon dioxide that humans are putting into the atmosphere  the burning of fossil fuels tends to put a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere  Um    so we are entering into uncharted territory now  in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide  the concentrations of carbon dioxide that are now being put into the atmosphere as a result of industrialization and the use of fossil fuels

Well  good  The reason I wanted to talk to you was that while you were presenting you linguistics project in class the other day  well  you know  I was thinking you are a perfect candidate for the dean s undergraduate research fund  
 
Student 
 
 
Um     Professor   I am really sure what the    um     dean      
Professor 
Undergraduate research fund is     It is a mouthful I suppose  OK  Here s the thing  Every year the school has a pool of money to fund a number of research projects of undergraduate students  Because as you can imagine  indepth research often requires monetary support  
 
Student 
 
 
I would like to expand on my research  
Professor 
Good  First a panel of professors reviews the applications for the grant  And then they decide which project should be funded  The allotted money could be used for travel expenses  to attend a conference for example  or things like supplies  research equipment  resources that are necessary to conduct the research  
 
Student I 
see  
Professor 
Right  And I think you should apply for this grant  Your project is definitely eligible  And you can 
expand it if you have the necessary resources  So  does it sound like something you would be interested in  
 
Student 
 
 
Oh  yeah  sounds great  I thought the topic I work on was very interesting  and it is certainly relevant to my linguistics major   I assume it will also look good when I try to get into graduate school  But how do I apply for the grant  
 
Professor 
 
It is pretty straightforward  A brief description of your proposed project  and an estimated budget  How much you need to spend and what you intend to spend it on  Also a glowing letter of recommendation from a linguistics professor wouldn t hurt  which I d be more than happy to write up for you  
 
Student 
 
OK  Cool  I am pretty clear on how to carry out my project  but I am not sure where I can find more information on the subject  
 
Professor 
 
Well  I have already thought of that  There s this private library at a university in Boston  By the way  because I graduated from that school  I can get you access to it  no problem  You see  the library houses lots of unpublished documents that are relevant to your topic  
 
Student 
 
So I can put that on the application for the grant  that I plan on using material from that library for my research and figure a trip to Boston into my budget  
 
Professor 
 
Exactly  I really think judging from your work in class  and the relevance and clarity of this project  you really have a good chance of getting the funding  
 
Student 
 
 
OK  I ll definitely apply then  
Professor 
The sooner the better   It is due in a few weeks  Gook Luck  And I ll get that letter written up right 
away  

TPO20 Lecture3 Literature Folktales

Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class

Professor

All right  so now we ve talked about folk legends and seen that their     one of their key features is there s usually some real history behind them  They are often about real people  so you can identify with the characters  and that s what engages us in them  The particular stories might not be true and some of the characters or events might be made up  But there s still a sense that the story could have been true since it is about a real person  That s distinct contrast from the other main branch of popular storytelling  which is folk tales

Folk tales are imaginative stories that     um     like folk legends  they have been passed down orally  from storyteller to storyteller for     since ancient times  But with folk tales you don t ever really get the sense that the story might have been true  They are purely imaginative and so quite revealing  I think anyway  about the culture and the connection between folk tales and culture  which we ll talk about

But first let s go over the various types of folk tale and focus specifically on Norwegian folk tales since they illustrate the variety pretty well  There are in general three main types of Norwegian folk tales

One is animal stories  where animals are the main characters  They can be wild animals or domestic  and a lot of times they can talk and behave like humans  but at the same time  they retain their animal characteristics too  They tend to involve animals like bears  wolves and foxes  The point of these stories  their  their internal objectives  so the speak  is usually to explain some feature of the animal  how it arose  So there s one about a fox who fools a bear into going ice fishing with his tail  When the bear puts his tail into the water through a hole in the ice  to try and catch a fish  the ice freezes around it  and he ends up pulling his tail off  So that s why bears to this day have such short tails

The second category of Norwegian folk tale is the supernatural  Eh     stories about giants and dragons and trolls  and humans with supernatural powers or gifts  like invisibility cloaks  Or where people are turned into animals and back again into a person  those are called transformation stories

There s a well known Norwegian supernatural folk tale  a transformation story called East of the Sun and West of the Moon  which we ll read  It involves a prince who is a white bear by night and a human by day  And he lives in the castle that s east of the Sun and west of the Moon  which the heroine in the story has to try to find  Besides being a good example of a transformation story  this one also has a lot of the common things that tend to show up in folk tales  You will find the standard opening   once upon a time         And it has stock characters like a prince  and a poor but beautiful peasant girl  she is the heroine I mentioned  And     um     it has a very conventional form  So no more than two characters are involved in any one scene  And it has a happy ending  And it s     the story is presented as though     well  even though a lot of the actions that occurred are pretty fantastic  so you d never think of it as realistic  The characters still act like     they resemble real people  They are not real or even based on historical figures  But you might have a supernatural story involving a king  and he d act like you d expect a Norwegian king to act

OK  The third main kind of folk tale is the comical story  We ll say more later about these  but for now  just be aware of the category and that they can contain supernatural aspects  but they are usually more playful and amusing overall than supernatural stories

Now  as I said  traditionally  folk tales were just passed down orally  Each generation of storytellers had their own style of telling a story  But     um     in Norway  before the 19th century  folk tales were just for kids  They weren t seen as worthy of analysis or academic attention  But this changed when the romantic movement spread throughout Europe in the mid 19th century  Romantics looked at folk tales as sort of a reflection of the soul of the people  So there was something distinctly Norwegian in folk tales from Norway  And there was renewed pride in the literature and art forms of individual countries  As a result  the first collection of Norwegian folk tales is published in 1852  And there have been many new editions published since then  For the people of Norway  these stories are now an important part of what it means to be Norwegian

TPO20 Lecture4 Biology Snowshoe Hare  
 
Narrator 
 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class  
 
Professor 
 
Now  James  you said you had been to the State of Maine  right  
Student 
Yeah  actually I lived in western Maine until I was about sixteen  
 
Professor 
 
Great  So why don t you tell everybody what is like there in the winter  
Student 
The winter  Well  it s cold  And there s lots of snow  you wouldn t believe how much snow we 
used to get  
 
Professor 
 
Actually I would  I did field research up there a couple of winters  And it really is an incredible environment  And to survive in that sort of environment  animals have to adapt  to evolve in response to their surroundings  As you recall  an adaptation is any feature  um    physical or behavioral feature of a species that helps it survive and reproduce  And in adapting to extreme climates  like Maine in the winter time  animals can evolve in pretty interesting ways  Take  for example  the snowshoe hare  
 
Ok  the snowshoe hare  and of course  that s H A R E  like a rabbit  Although I probably should mention that technically a hare is not exactly the same as a rabbit  even though it is very similar   The primary difference is that a rabbit s young are born blind and without fur   while a hare s babies are born with a full coat and able to see  
 
Now  the snowshoe hare  tell me  what sort of adaptations do you think it has developed that help it survive the Maine winters  I ll give you a hint  Food isn t an issue  The hare actually has abundant food in the small twigs it finds  
 
Student
Well  I don t know  I mean  I know we used to try to look for these rabbits  eh    hares  when we went hiking in the winter   but it was often hard to find them in the snow  
 
Professor 
 
Yes  That s exactly right  The major concern of the snowshoe hare in the winter is predators  And now that includes humans  So one of its adaptations is basically camouflage  In other words  its coat  its fur   turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter   which makes it harder for the hare s predators to see it against the white snow  
 
Student 
 
Yeah  but I could swear I remembered seeing rabbits in the snow a couple of times  I means hares  that were brown  
 
Professor 
 
Well  you may very well have  Timing is really important  but the snowshoe hare doesn t always get it exactly right  Its chances for survival are best if it turns white about the time of the first snowfall  And it s the amount of daylight that triggers the changing of the hare s coat  As the days get shorter   that is  as the Sun is up for a shorter and shorter time each day  the snowshoe hare starts growing white fur and shedding its brown fur   The hare does a pretty good job with its timing  but sometimes when there s a really early or late snow  it stands out  Plus  it takes about a month for the snowshoe hare s coat to completely change color   So if there s a particularly early snowfall  it s very likely that the hare s fur would not yet be totally white  And that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare  
 
OK  What else  Other adaptations  Susan  
Student 
Well  it s called the snowshoe hare  so are its feet somehow protect it from the cold  
 
Professor 
 
Well  this animal s name does have to do with an adaptation of its feet  Uh    though  not like it has warm furry boots or something to keep its feet from getting cold  You ve probably never needed to wear snowshoes  But  well  snowshoes are not like thick furry shoes designed to keep the feet warm  they are actually quite thin  but very wide  What they do is spread out the weight of the foot coming down on the snow  See  the problem with walking on snow is that you sink in with every step  But with snowshoes  you don t sink in  you walk on top of the snow  It makes walking through the Maine countryside in the winter much easier   
 
Anyway  the snowshoe hare has an adaptation that plays on the same idea  It has hind feet that act like snowshoes  I mean  it s paws are wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow  And this is a huge advantage for the snowshoe hare since by contrast  the feet of its predators usually sink right down into the snow  
 
 
Now  another advantage related to this is that unlike many animals in winter  snowshoe hares can stay lean and light weight  They accumulate essentially no body fat  Can anyone guess why this is so  
 
Student 
 
They don t eat very much  
Professor 
Well  yes  But not because there isn t enough food around  It s because  like I said  food is almost always within reach  and they don t have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winters

Conversation1
Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor  

Professor Excuse me  can I help you  You look a little lost  

Student Yeah  I am  This is my first day on campus  and I don t know where anything is  

Professor Can t find your orientation session  

Student Uh huh  What a way to begin  Lost going to orientation

Professor Well  my guess is in the auditorium  that s where they usually are  

Student You re right  the general ones  I went to one of those sessions ealier today  But now I need the one for my major  engineering  My schedule says the meeting room is in     Johnson Hall  In the engineering department  which should be right here in front of us  according to the map  But this building is called the Morgan Hall 

Professor Well  your map reading skills are fine actually  This used to be Johnson Hall  all right  Trouble is they changed the name to Morgan Hall last spring  So they sent you a map with an old name  I am surprised  

Student Well  this was actually mailed out month and month ago  I got a second pack in the mail more recently with another one of these maps in it  I guess they must have the updated name  I left that one in my dorm room 

Professor Well  things change fast around here  This building was renamed after one of our professors  She retired a few months ago  She is very well known in the world of physics  Too bad for Johnson  I guess  

Student Who is Johnson anyway 

Professor Oh  one of the early professors here  Unfortunately  I thinks his ideas are going out of style  Science kept marching forward  

Student I ll say it does  That s why I transferred to this university  I was really impressed with all the research equipment you guys have at the laboratories  You are really on the forefront 

Professor Um    so do you know what kind of engineering you want to specialize in  

Student Yeah  aerospace engineering 

Professor Well  the aerospace engineering department here is excellent  Eh    do you know that this university was the first one in the country to offer a program in aerospace engineering  

Student Yeah  I know  And a couple of students who graduated from here became astronauts and orbited the Earth  

Professor Right  The department has many prominent alumni  Well  you might end up taking some of your advanced math course with me  I get a lot of students from the engineering department because I teach the required applied mathematics courses  

Student Oh  cool  Actually  I want to get a minor in math  

Professor Excellent  Hmm    A major in aerospace engineering with a minor in math  you ll go far with that degree  More of our students should do that  There are so many more opportunities available in the field when you have a strong math background 

Student I m glad to hear you say that 
TPO 21 Lecture 1 Astronomy Geocentric&Heliocentric theory  
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a history of science class  Aristarchus Heliocentric Theory


Professor Ok  we have been talking about how throughout history  it was often difficult for people to give up ideas which have long been taken for granted as scientific truth  even if those ideas were false  In Astronomy  for example  the distinction between the solar system and the universe wasn t clear until modern times  The ancient Greeks believed that what we called the solar system was in fact the entire universe  and that the universe was geocentric  Geocentric means Earth centered  so the geocentric view holds that the Sun  the planets  and the stars  all revolve around the Earth  which is stationary  Of course  we now know that the planets  including Earth  revolve around the Sun  and that the solar system is only a tiny part of the universe  

So  why did the ancient Greeks believe that the Earth was the center of the universe  Well  it made sense to them  Observations of the sky make it appear as if the Sun  the moon  and the stars all revolve around the Earth everyday  while the Earth itself stayed in one place  And this view is also supported by their philosophical and religious beliefs about the origin and structure of the universe  It was presented in the works of well known Greek philosophers as early as the fourth century B C E   and the geocentric theory continue to prevail in Western thought for almost 2 000 years  until the 17th century 

Now  what s especially interesting is that when astronomical observations were made that seemed to be inconsistent with the geocentric view  the ancient Greeks did not really consider alternative theories  It was so intuitive  so sensible that the Earth was the center of the universe that astronomers found ways to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomena within the geocentric view  

For example  Greek astronomers made excellent  very accurate observations of the movements of the planets  but the observations revealed a bit of a problem  The geocentric theory said  that the planets would move around the Earth in one direction  However  astronomers noticed that at times  several planets seem to stop moving in one direction and start moving backward in their orbits around the Earth  and they came up with a theory that these planets themselves moved in smaller circles called epicycles as they travelled around the Earth  Here s a picture of what they imagined  You see how this epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet  Of course  today we know that this appearance of backward motion is caused by the fact that Earth  as well as other planets  all move in their own orbits around the Sun  and the relative movements of the planets with respect to each other can get quite complex 

However  there were a few astronomers in Greece and other places who didn t agree with the geocentric view  for example  a Greek astronomer who lived in the third century B C E  He proposed the theory that our planetary system might be heliocentric  his name was Aristarchus  Heliocentric means Sun centered  that the Earth revolves around the Sun  Aristarchus recognized from his calculations that the Sun was much larger than the Earth and other planets  It was probably this discovery that led him to conclude that the universe is heliocentric  I mean  isn t it more sensible to think that a smaller heavenly body would orbit a larger one  rather than the opposite 

However  his proposition was rejected largely based on other scientific beliefs held at the time  which all made sense in a way even if they were incorrect  Let me mention two objections Greeks made to Aristarchus s theory  First  they believe that everything that moves creates its own wind  so to speak  everyone has this experience when you are running  right  So  they thought that if the Earth itself was moving  there would have to be a constant wind blowing  sweeping them off their feet  and of course there wasn t  And second  the idea of an Earth that moved didn t fit in with the ancient Greeks  understanding of gravity  They thought that gravity was basically a natural tendency of all things to move towards the center of the universe  which was the Earth  or the center of the Earth  so that explains why apples and other falling objects were falling straight down  If the Sun was at the center of the universe  things would fall toward the Sun and away from the Earth  which of course they didn t  So these were some of the reasons they rejected the heliocentric theory 
TPO21 Lecture 2 Computer Science Software Development  
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a Computer Science class  The professor is discussing software engineering 

Professor We ve been talking about the software development cycle  and today I d like to move on to the next stage of that cycle testing  and why finding bugs during testing is actually a great thing  Eh   eh    the quality of the software product often relies heavily on how well it s been tested  Liz  

Student Um    just a quick thing  Bugs is the word for problems in the program code  right 

Professor
Yeah  in code or in a computer itself  There is a bit of a story behind that term  Um    back in the 1940s  when the computer industry was just starting  a group of computer scientists was working late one night  and there was a problem in one of the computers  circuits1  When they examined it  they found a five centimeter long moth caught in there  Once they debugged the computer  it worked just fine  And ever since then  all kinds of computer problems have been known as bugs  

Anyway  you want to find bugs while the software is still in the development and testing phases  Finding them when the software product has already been put on the market can be quite embarrassing  Generally speaking  every software development project has a group of testers and a group of developers  Jack 

Student And they are different people 

Professor They are generally completely different group of people  My personal opinion is that they have to be different groups of people because developers often have a bias for their own work  and it blinds them to certain problems that might be obvious to somebody else  So it is always good to have a different set of eyes to go in there and make sure that everything is tested properly 

Ok  now  here s the key  Developers and testers have different mentalities  The mentality of the software developer is constructive  creative  they are spending long hours working together to create and build something new  A software tester  on the other hand  their entire goal is to look at this product and find problems with it  to improve it  Now  this difference between the testers and the developers can lead to an environment where there is a bit of friction  And that friction sometimes makes it difficult for the two teams to work together 

There are two projects that I worked on a couple of years ago  One  which I ll call Project Split  well  the testing and development teams did not work well together  And the other  I ll call Project Unity  during which both teams worked very well together  Now  during Project Split  we had defect meetings where the developers and the testers met together  eh    eh    to discuss various problems and how they should be fixed  And you could sense the conflict just by walking into the room  Literally  the testers and the developers sat on opposite sides on the table  Um    and     and the developers were very defensive about the feedback 

Student Well  if bugs are being pointed out they wouldn t be too happy since its their work 

Professor Exactly  Now   cause the two teams weren t working well together  the fixes were coming very very slowly  And you know  a lot of times when you fix bugs you introduce new bugs  or you discover bugs and other areas that only come to light because something has been changed  so fixing all those new additional bugs was also being delayed  Um    the test process went on much longer than expected and we ended up having to put the product on the market with known bugs in it  which was obviously not ideal 

Student Ok  and what about Project Unity  How was it different 

Professor 
Um    this was different because two teams worked closely together during the defect meetings  instead of put up walls  Um    we didn t even talked about  you know  who should fix this  who is at fault2  We all acknowledge what needed to be fixed  So if we had ten bugs  we said   Hey  you know what  Let s do this one first  cause this would expose another whole bunch of defects that we haven t even seen yet   So we were being proactive3 and effective  And because we were so much more effective with our time  we were actually able to do more than just fix the bugs  we even put in some improvements that we hadn t planned  
TPO21 Conversation 2
Narrator Listen to a conversation between a student and her public relations professor 

Student Hi  professor Gordin  I really learned a lot from your lecture  the one about analyzing all those different segments of the population  Oh  the official term is audience  right  I never imagine that one company could have over thirty audiences to communicate with  

Professor Yeah  a lot of students are taken aback by this  and some public relations consultants don t figure it out until they ve worked in the field a while  

Student Everyone thinks  public relations  eh  PR is easy  but there s a lot to it  You really got to know what you are doing 

Professor Absolutely  So  Stacy  your email implied that you needed my advice about graduate school  

Student No  since my undergraduate degree will be in public relations  I ve already decided to get a master s degree in marketing  Sorry  I wasn t clear  My issue is  I have got two require courses and two electives  I am trying to figure out which elective course is to take  My advisor suggested economics and accounting  but I am not really sure  

Professor About  

Student Well  I endured accounting and economics in high school and barely stayed awake  they were so     

Professor Ok  Ok  I hear you  Eh    you say you wanted a master s in marketing  you have got one more semester till graduation  Have you taken any marketing courses yet  

Student No  I figured I ve got the marketing basis already since I have take every PR in communication courses offered here 

Professor Well  there s some overlap between PR and marketing  but there are important differences too  Marketing focuses on selling your product or service  eh  you know  attracting customers through advertising  and also building relationships with customers  That s what a marketing department does  PR is all about  it involves relationships too  that s why I am saying the two fields overlap  But in PR  you are developing relationships with a wider range of audience  

Student Right  Like employees  suppliers  the media  I do understand this in theory  but aren t you still selling your product  just in a different way  

Professor Not necessarily  Ok  do you remember that PR strategy I alluded to the other day  The one our university uses  a strategy that doesn t overlap its marketing strategy 

Student You mean how the university invites local residents to attend certain lectures and classes for free  

Professor Yeah  this cultivates a sense of good will and helps the university avoid becoming isolated from the larger community  Bringing neighbors into our classrooms is good PR  but it is not marketing since our neighbors aren t our customers  for the most part 

Student That s why I want to focus on marketing in graduate school  Wouldn t having expertise in PR and marketing giving me more career options  

Professor Yeah  but you ll also want to enjoy your work  So for you electives  why don t you take advertising principles and intro to marketing  which I teach  This way  you ll find out if marketing is something you really want to pursue  Graduate School tuition is expensive  and these courses will give you a good overview of the field before committing yourself  

Student I wish my advisor had suggested those courses  

Professor Well  I am someone who has worked in both marketing and PR  so I can offer a different perspective than someone who only teaches    
TPO21 Lecture3 Biology Snake Evolution  
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor Probably back in some previous biology course you learned that snakes evolved from lizards  and that the first snakes weren t venomous and then along came more advanced snakes  the venomous snakes  Ok  venomous snakes are the ones that secrete poisonous substances or venom  like the snakes of the viper family or cobras  Then there is non venomous snakes like constrictors and pythons  Another family of snakes  the colubrids  don t really fit neatly into either category though  Colubrids  and you probably learned this too  although they are often classified as venomous snakes  they are actually generally non venomous  They are classified as venomous snakes because they resemble them  their advanced features more than the other non venomous snakes 

Now  what if I told you that there is a good chance that most everything I just said is wrong  Well  everything except the part about snakes evolving from lizards  See  the basic theory about snake evolution has been challenged by a recent study that revealed a whole new understanding of evolutionary relationship for reptiles  you know  which reptiles descended from which ancestors  The researchers study the proteins in the venom genes of various species of colubrids  Emm    snake venom is a mixture of proteins  some toxic  poisonous  and some not  By analyzing the DNA  the genetic material of the proteins  the researchers could focus on the toxic genes and use them to trace the evolution of snake venom  and from this  the evolution of snakes 

Traditionally  to understanding evolutionary relationships  we looked at various easily observed physical characteristics of animals  their skeleton  the size of their brain  and    and then classify them based on similarities and differences  The problem with this method is that characteristics that appear similar may actually have developed in quite different ways  For example  some venoms are chemical based  and others are bacteria based  so they clearly had to have developed along different routes and may not be as closely related as we thought 

Now  and not everyone will agree about this  The classification based on DNA seems to be much more reliable  Ok  back to the research  The researchers found that venom evolved before snakes even existed  about a hundred million years before  Now  a couple of venomous lizards were included in this study  And the researchers found some of the same DNA in their venom as in the snakes  venom  This suggested that the common ancestor of all snakes was actually venomous lizard  which means that actually  according to this research  anyway  in terms of the snakes  ancestry  there is no such thing as a non venomous snake  not even colubrids  What separates colubrids from other snakes we have been classifying is venomous  is not the lack of venom  but the lack of an effective way to deliver the venom into its prey  In most venomous snakes  like vipers and cobras  the venom is used to catch and immobilize the prey  but in colubrids  venom drips onto the prey only after the prey is in the snake s mouth  So for colubrids  the venom must serve some other purpose  maybe linked to digesting prey  As the different families of venomous snakes evolved  the teeth moved forward  becoming larger  and the venom becoming stronger  so the evolution of the obvious venomous snakes  like cobras and vipers  is about the evolution of an efficient delivery system  not so much the evolution of the venom itself 

So  if there are no truly non venomous snakes  were the so called non venomous snakes  like constrictors and pythons  were they venomous at some point in their evolution  Well  that s not clear at this point  Constrictors have evolved to kill their prey by crushing  but perhaps they once were venomous  and then at some point their venom producing apparatus4 wasn t needed anymore  so it gradually disappeared  There s one species of snake  the brown tree snake  that uses both constriction and venom  depending on its prey  So  well  it is possible 

So  we have these new concepts of snakes  evolution and a new DNA database  all these information on the genetic makeup of snake venom  And what we have learned from this has led researchers to believe that venom proteins may have some exciting applications in the field of medical research  You see  venom alters biological functions in the same way certain drugs do  and the big benefit of drugs made from snakes venom would be that they target only certain cells  so maybe that ll create fewer side effects  Now  it sounds far fetched5  venom is the basis for human drugs  So far  only one protein has been targeted for study as a potential drug  but who knows  maybe someday 

TPO21 Lecture 4 Art History Alice Neel  
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class 

Professor 
All right  so today we are moving on to Alice Neel  N E E L  Um    Alice Neel painted portraits  she was born in Pennsylvania  and she lived from 1900 to 1984  And I guess you might say  she experienced difficulties as an artist  She was in her 70s  before she had her first major solo exhibition  Um  and this is due at least in part to eh    or    because of photography  After photography became regarded as an art form  portrait painting became less prestigious6  less respected as an art form  And  well  art photography kind of took its place  so you can imagine that a portrait artist  would have had a hard time finding acceptance 

Eh  but the real reason I want to look at Neel  is that I really find her style     eh  she had interesting ways of portraying people  She combined some elements of realism  What s realism  Alison 

Student It s like painting something exactly how it is  so an artist would try to make it as accurate  um    and objective as possible  Painting stuff just how it appears on the surface 

Professor Ok  good  So Neel combined realism with  well  actually  with expressionism  And that is  We  we just covered this 

Student Um    It s into emotion  like artists are trying to  well  express themselves through the painting  right 

Professor 
Yep  The artist is depicting subjective emotions  showing the inner reality as interpreted by the artist rather than the outward form  So the image itself might be distorted or exaggerated in some way  The expression overrides7 objective representation  Ok  so  Alice Neel combined these two styles     Yes 

Student Em    How is that even possible  How can your portray something exactly as it is and at the same time distort it with emotions  I don t get it 

Professor 
All right  good question  It is actually a good lead in8 to some of the techniques that Neel used  that she employed to bridge that contradiction  In a minute  I ll show you some of her portraits  and I ll want you to notice a few things about them 

First  Neel s use of bold color  All right  You ll see she uses color to convey emtion and feeling  like the subjects  clothing for instance  it appears brighter than it really is  And the subjects  the people being portrayed  Neel paid special attention to faces  The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed  these are quite realistic  like the realists  work  But another thing Neel did was use elongated  sort of stretchy figures 

Student But didn t a lot of expressionist painters do that  So really your are saying that Neel s techniques were similar to what other artists were doing  What was it that she did  that was like all her own 

Professor Ok  well  I think it has to do partly with the way she combined these techniques  So  for example  those realistic faces and eyes  but bright  distorted figures  It is a mix  You ll see that her portraits do reflect reality  the people that were actually sitting there  Realism was important in the sense that she wanted to show people as they really were  much like a photographer would  But Neel wasn t satisfied with photo like realism  she went beyond that  And this is where expressionism comes in 

She believed in capturing the whole person  not just what was on the surface  that s where the expressionists  distortion is important  in an attempt to reveal the subjects  character or personality  

But Neel s paintings are distinctive for her time in part because they are portraits  Remember I said that photography and art photography had largely taken the place of portraiture  to the extent that some critics had declared the genre of portraiture to be dead  But Neel felt that painting should reflect reality  a real realist s stance9 you could say  And to her  individuals  people best reflect the reality of their time  of the age that they lived in  so she painted portraits  And if you look at her work  we are talking in the vicinity of10 three thousand paintings  If your looked at them  it is like this gallery of the whole century  an enormous range of subjects  families  women  children  artists  people in poverty  these paintings really span class  age and gender  It is like she transformed the genre  it is not just formal depictions of presidents and ancestors any more 

But keep in mind that she was doing this when abstract art dominated the art scene  Representations of people weren t fashionable in the art world  And it wasn t until fairly late in the century that critics recognized the power of what she did

Conversation 1  Faculty Advisor 
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and a faculty advisor for the university newspaper 
Student  Hi  I am sorry to bother you  but…
Faculty advisor  Yes  
Student  This is about the newspaper  
Faculty Advisor  Oh  Ok  Well  I am only the advisor  the newspaper office is off campus on Pine Street  Eh…what was it  Did you want to work for the paper  We are always looking for writers  
Student  Well  my problem was with the writing actually  with an article that was published in yesterday s newspaper  
Faculty Advisor  Oh  Which one  
Student  The one about the student government and its president Sally Smith 
Faculty Advisor  Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the statue  Eh  the statue at the main entrance of the university  
Student  Well  that s part of it  But you know  the editor used the situation to say some really unfair things  about the student government  and the president Sally Smith in particular  I think the paper should publish a retraction  or at the very least an apology to Sally  
Faculty Advisor  Ok  Um… if I remember correctly  what you are referring to wasn t a news story  but an editorial  right  Eh  it was on the opinion page  it was signed by one of the editors  and was clearly labeled as commentary  
Student  Well  yes  But the thing about the statue  Sally made this simple comment that was in really bad condition and should be replaced  And  well  the tone in the editorial was demeaning  It accused her of not respecting the past and it had some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary  
Faculty Advisor  Wait a minute  Remind me  
Student  Well  you know  it implied that Sally doesn t know much about the university s history and it called her a big city politician because she s from Boston  It s just mean spirited  isn t it  
Faculty Advisor  Haven t you heard the saying  all publicity is good publicity   
Student  Well…
Faculty Advisor  I d say the article is bringing attention to the student government organization  which is pretty invisible  Eh  you rarely hear about what the student government is doing  
Student  But this article…
Faculty Advisor  And the piece  well  yeah  it had a bit of an exaggerated tone  It was satirical  or at least it was meant to be  It wasn t just poking fun at Sally  but the whole idea that our school is sort of rural  and you know  not cosmopolitan  
Student  Well  none of us thought it was very funny  
Faculty Advisor  Well  sometimes it s best just to roll with it  It is just a cliché  everybody knows it is not true  
Student  But I thought we could expect better than that here  
Faculty Advisor  Well  I am certainly in favor of getting a variety of viewpoints   so why don t you go talk to the editor  Jennifer Hamilton  and tell her you want equal time  You or Sally could write a response   
Student   Really  She would let us do that    Didn t she write it  
Faculty Advisor  I ll let Jennifer know you are coming  she feels the same way I do  She is journalism major  She would be happy to publish another point of view  
TPO22 Lecture 1  Anthropology 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class  
Professor  One of the big questions when we look at prehistory is why did the earliest states form ?Well  to begin we d better define exactly what we mean when we talk about states  The human groups that are the smallest and have the least social and political complexity  we call bands  The groups that are the largest and most socially and politically complex  we call states  So  the level of complexity here refers to the organization of people into large  diverse groups  and densely populated communities  And there are four levels in total  bands  tribes  chiefdoms and states  
But  but back to my original question  Why did early states form  Why not just continue to live in small groups  Why become more complex  
One theory called the environmental approach hypothesizes that the main force behind state formation was population growth  It assumes that centralized management was critical to dealing with issues caused by sudden population surges  like a strain on limited food supplies  
At the least complex end of the spectrum  the few families living in bands are able to meet their own basic needs  They usually hunt together and forage whatever foods are available to them  instead of domesticating animals and planting crops  In order to efficiently take advantage of the wild foods available  bands are often nomadic and move around following herds of animals  This strategy is feasible when you have a small population  
But when you have a large population  well  the whole population can t just get up and move to follow a wild herd of animals  So you need sophisticated technologies to produce enough food for everyone  And there is an increase need to resolve social problems that arise as people begin to compete for resources  To manage intensified food production  to collect  store and distribute food  you need centralized decision making  centralized decision makers  
It s the same thing when it comes to maintaining social order  You need to create and efficiently enforce a formal legal code  It makes sense to have a centralized authority in charge of that  right  So a hierarchy forms  By definition  states had at least three social levels  Usually  an upper class of rulers  a middle class comprised of managers and merchants  and a lower class of crop producers and agricultural laborers  
The environmental approach hypothesizes that states appear in certain environmental settings  settings which have a severe population problem or a shortage of agricultural land  But not everyone agrees with the theory  It definitely has some weaknesses  For example  states have developed in places like the mild lowlands of Mesoamerica and in Egypt s Nile River Valley  Both places had vast areas of fertile farmland  no shortage of agricultural land  And what about population increase  Well  there were some early states that formed where there wasn t any sudden population increase  So it seems that these are valid criticisms of the environmental approach  
TPO22 Lecture 2  Astronomy 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 
Professor  Today  I want to talk about a paradox the ties in with the topic we discuss last time  We were discussing the geological evidence of water  liquid water on Earth and Mars three to four billion years ago  So  what evidence of a liquid water environment did we find in rock samples taking from the oldest rocks on Earth  
Student  Eh… Like pebbles  fossilized algae  
Professor  Right  And on Mars  
Student  Dry channels  
Professor  Good  All evidence of water in liquid form  large quantities of it  Now  remember when we talked about star formation  we said that as a star ages  it becomes brighter  right  Hydrogen turns into Helium  which releases energy  So our standard model of star formation suggests that the Sun wasn t nearly as bright three to four billion years ago as it is today  which means the temperatures on Earth and Mars would have been lower  which in turn suggests…
Student  There would have been ice on Earth or Mars  
Professor  Correct  If the young Sun was much fainter and cooler than the Sun today  liquid water couldn t have existed on either planet  
Now  this apparent contradiction between geologic evidence and the stellar evolution model became known as the faint young Sun paradox  
Now  there have been several attempts to solve this paradox  
First  there was the greenhouse gas solution  Well  you are probably familiar with the greenhouse gas effect  so I won t go into details now  The idea was that trapped greenhouse gases in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars might have caused temperatures to raise enough to compensate for the low heat the young Sun provided  And so it would have been warm enough on these planets for liquid water to exist  So  what gas do you think was the first suspect in causing the greenhouse effect  
Student  Um…carbon dioxide  I guess  Like today  
Professor  In fact  studies indicate that four billion years ago  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were much higher than today s levels  But the studies also indicate that they weren t high enough to do the job make up for a faint Sun  
Then some astronomers came up with the idea that atmospheric ammonia might have acted as a greenhouse gas  But ammonia would have been destroyed by the ultra violet light coming from the Sun and it had to be ruled out too  
Another solution  which is proposed much later  was that perhaps the young Sun wasn t faint at all  perhaps it was bright  So it is called the bright young Sun solution  according to which the Sun would have provided enough heat for the water on Earth and Mars to be liquid  But how could the early Sun be brighter and hotter than predicted by the standard model  Well  the answer is mass  
Student  You mean the Sun had more mass when it was young  
Professor  Well  if the young Sun was more massive than today s  it would have been hotter and brighter than the model predicts  But this would mean that it had lost mass over the course of four billion years  
Student  Is that possible  
Professor  Actually  the Sun is constantly losing mass through the solar wind  a stream of charged particles constantly blowing off the Sun  we know the Sun s current rate of mass loss  but if we assume that this rate has been steady over the last four billion years  the young Sun wouldn t have been massive enough to have warmed Earth  let alone Mars  not enough to have caused liquid water  
Student  Maybe the solar wind was stronger then  
Professor  There is evidence that the solar wind was more intense in the past  But we don t know for sure how much mass our Sun s lost over the last four billion years  Astronomers tried to estimate what solar mass could produce the required luminosity to explain liquid water on these planets  They also took into account that with a more massive young Sun  the planets would be closer to the Sun than they are today  And they found that about seven percent more mass would be required  
Student  So the young Sun had seven percent more mass than our Sun  
Professor  Well  we don t know  According to observations of young Sun like stars  our Sun may have lost as much as six percent of its initial mass  which doesn t quite make it  On the other hand  this estimate is based on a small sample  And the bright young Sun solution is appealing  We simply need more data to determine the mass loss rate of stars  So there s reason to believe that we will get an answer to that piece of the puzzle one day  
TPO22 Conversation 2  Professor 
Narrator  Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his music history professor  
Student  So  I was wondering what I could do to improve my paper before the final draft is due  
Professor  Well  Michael  I have no problem with your writing style  It s graceful and clear  Eh  and it s interesting that you are writing about your grandmother s piano concert  
Student  Yeah  when you said we had to attend a concert and write about it  I immediately thought of her  I have been to lots of her concerts  So I am really familiar with her music  
Professor  That s not necessarily an advantage  Familiarity sometimes makes it hard to see things objectively  
Student  So I shouldn t write about my grandmother  
Professor  No  no  no  I am just talking in general  But as I mentioned in my comments  I d like you to place your grandmother s concert in… in a broader context  
Student  Yeah  I saw that  but I wasn t sure what you meant  I mean  I mentioned my grandmother s childhood  how much her parents love music  how she played the piano at all our family gatherings  
Professor  Ok  I see what happened now  By broader context  I mean how the concert relates to some period in music history  
Student  I see  Ok  Um… I have an idea  
Professor  Ok  
Student  Well  as you read in my paper  my grandmother performs classical music  
Professor  Yes  
Student  That s her true love  But for most of her career  she performed jazz  She originally studied to be a classical pianist  But jazz was in its heyday back then  and when she got out of the conservatory  she was invited to join a jazz orchestra  And the opportunity was just too good to turn down  
Professor  Really  Well  that s fascinating  Because she probably had to reinvent her whole musical style  
Student  She did  But jazz was where the money was at that time  at least for her  
Professor  But she eventually went back to classical  
Student  Right  But only recently  
Professor  Ok  
Student  So if I can show how her choices relate to what was happening in the world of music at the time… 
Professor  I think that might work very nicely  
Student  And if I do that  I guess I ll have to like  interview her  
Professor  Right  
Student  And I guess that would mean…
Professor  You ll have to rewrite most of your paper  
Student  Ouch  
Professor  Yeah  Would an extra week ease the pain  
Student  Definitely  
Professor  Ok  So are there other musicians in your family  
Student  Yeah  My mother plays piano  too  Not as well as my grandmother  but…
Professor  And you  
Student  I don t play any instruments  but I sing in the university choir  In fact  we are performing next week  and I have a solo  
Professor  That s great  Could I tell the class about your concert  
Student  Um…sure  But…about my paper… what question should I be asking my grandmother  
Professor  You know what  I have a meeting now  Why don t you come to class a few minutes early tomorrow  
Student  Will do  
TPO22 Lecture 3  Zoology 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a zoology class  
Professor  A mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period  short  geologically speaking that is  like when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago  And the fossil record  it indicates that in all the time that animals have inhabited Earth  there have been five great mass extinctions  dinosaurs being the most recent  In each of the others up to half of all land animals and up to 95 percent of marine species disappeared  
Well  today we are witnessing a sixth mass extinction  but unlike the others  the current loss of bio diversity can be traced to human to human activity  Since the Stone Age  humans have been eliminating species and altering ecosystems with astounding speed  Countless species have disappeared due to over hunting  habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation  pollution and other unnatural human causes  
So  as a way of repairing some of that damage  a group of conservation biologists has proposed an ambitious  or some might say  a radical plan  involving large vertebrates  or   megafauna  Megafauna include elephants  wild horses  big cats  camels  large animals  Eh  actually  the proposal focuses on a particular subset of megafauna  the kind that lived during the Pleistocene epoch  
Ok  The Pleistocene epoch  most commonly known as the Ice Age  stretched from 1 8 million to 11 500 years ago  In the Americas  many megafauna began disappearing by the end of the Pleistocene  
So here s the biologists  idea  Take a select group of animals  megafauna from places like Africa and Asia  and introduce them into other ecosystems similar to their current homes  beginning in the United States  They call their plan Pleistocene rewilding  
Now  the advocates of Pleistocene rewilding cite two main goals  One is to help prevent the extinction of some endangered megafauna by providing new refuges  new habitats for them  The other is to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that has been lost in North America  What do I mean by restore evolutionary potential  Well as you know the evolution of any species is largely influenced by its interactions with other species  ?So during the Pleistocene epoch… let s take the now extinct American cheetah  for instance  We believe it played a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope  the antelope s amazing speed  to be exact  because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah  When the American cheetahs disappeared  their influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animals stopped  So it is conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continued to evolve  get faster maybe  if the cheetahs were still around  That s what s meant by evolutionary potential  Importing African cheetahs to the western United States could  in theory  put the pronghorn back onto its… uh  natural evolutionary trajectory according to these biologists  ?Another example is the interaction of megafauna with local flora  in particular  plants that rely on animals to disperse their seeds  Like Pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seeded American plants  such as the maclura tree  Many types of maclura used to grow in North American  buy today  just one variety remains and it is found in only two states  In the distant past  large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds  each the size of an orange in their droppings  Well  there aren t any mastodons left  but there are elephants  which descended from mastodons  Introduce elephants into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seeds  like their ancestors did  
Get the idea  Restoring some of the former balance to the ecosystem  But as I alluded to earlier  Pleistocene rewilding is extremely controversial  A big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might devastate plants and animals that are native to the western United States  In the years since the Pleistocene epoch  native species have adapted to the changing environmental there  plants  smaller animals  they have been evolving without megafauna for millennia  Also  animal species that went extinct 11 000 years ago  uh  some are quite different genetically from their modern day counterparts  like elephants don t have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the America West during the Ice Age  Granted  the climate today is not as cold as it was in the Pleistocene  But winters on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today  And there are many more considerations  Well  you see how complex this is  If you think about it though  the core problem with this sixth mass extinction is human interference  Pleistocene rewilding is based on good intentions  but you know  it probably would just be more of the same thing  
TPO22 Lecture 4  Music History 
?Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class  
Professor  So  uh  if you are a musician in the United States in the early twentieth century  where could you work  
Student  Same as now  I suppose  In an orchestra  mainly  
Professor  Ok  And where would the orchestra be playing  
Student  Uh  in a concert hall or a dance hall  
Professor  That s right  And smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to visual entertainment  like cabarets and variety shows  But the largest employer for musicians back then was the film industry  especially during the silent film era  
Student  Really  You mean being a piano player or something  I thought movie theaters would have used recorded music  
Professor  Well  no  Not during the silent film era  We are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in movie theaters was the best job for musicians  It was very well paid  The rapid growth of the film industry meant movie theaters were popping up everywhere  So suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians  In fact  over 20 000 jobs for musicians were gone  disappeared at the end of the silent film era  20 000  Ok  So from the beginning  music was a big part of film  even at the first…
Student  Excuse me  professor  I think I read somewhere that they used music to drown out the sound of the film projectors  
Professor  Yeah  That s good story  isn t it  Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only reason music was used  Well  think about it  Even if that were the case  noisy projectors were separated from the main house pretty quickly  yet music continued to accompany film  So  as I was saying  even the very first public projection of a film had piano accompaniment  So music was pretty much always there  
What s strange to me though  is that at first film music didn t necessarily correspond to what was on the screen  You know  eh  a fast number for a chase  deep bass notes for danger  something light and humorous for comedy  And that s instantly recognizable now  even expected  But in the very early days of film  any music was played  A theater owner would just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it  no matter what it was  Pretty quickly though  thankfully  everybody realized the music should suit the film  So eventually  film makers tried to get more control over the musical accompaniment of their films   and specify what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it  
Student  Are you saying there was no music written specifically for a particular movie  
Professor  Yeah  Original scores weren t common then  Rarely a filmmaker might send along an original score composed especially for a film  but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used  Yeah  that was a good time for a lot of musicians  But that all changed with the introduction of sound on film technology  Actually  even before that  organs could mimic a number of instruments and also do some sound effects  So they were starting to replace live orchestras in some movie theaters  and it only takes one person to play an organ  
Student  Ok  But even after that someone still had to play the music for the sound for the sound recordings  the soundtracks  
Professor  Yeah  But think of all the movie theaters there were  most employing about six to eight musicians  some even had full orchestras  But in the early 1930s  most theater owners installed new sound systems  So suddenly a lot of musicians were looking for work  Once recording technology took off  studio jobs working exclusively for one film company  eh  studio jobs did become available  But the thing is  each major movie company pretty much had only one orchestra for all their productions  a set number of regular musicians  So if you could get it  studio musician was a good job  If you were cut out for it  musicians had to be able to read music very well  since the producers were very conscious of how much money they were spending  They didn t want to waste any time  So a musician was expected to play complicated pieces of music pretty much without any preparation  If one couldn t do it  there were plenty of others waiting to try  So there was a lot of pressure to do well  




TPO 23
CONVERSATION 1
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of campus activities  
Student  I m here  cause    well  there s something I don t understand  I set an announcement for an event  And this morning I checked the events section of the university s website  And nothing  there is no mention of it  
Director  And when did you summit this request  
Student  Last Wednesday  I followed the instructions very carefully  I am sure it was Wednesday  because know announcements have be submitted three business days ahead of the posting day  
Director  And what s it for  
Student  A reading  
Director  A reading  
Student  Yes  A poetry reading  
Director  Oh  OK  When is it  
Student  In three days  It is an author from France we have been trying to get for a while  And now that he has finally agreed to come  no one will be there  
Director  Wow  This person is really coming all the way from France  
Student  Oh  no  He is teaching promising there will be in New York City this year  We were able to sell him on a nice size crowd   felt confident about that  Because the idea by I know how enthusiastic our group is  
Director  And your group   do you have a name  
Student  Um   it is kind of a loose group  you know  just a bunch of students in the French department who are interested in French literature  There s no formal structure or anything  I guess you could call us the French Literature Reading Group  
Director  OK  And it is a recognized group  By the university  I mean  
Student  No
Director  OK  
Student  But the French Department is funding this  on the condition that we do all the legwork 
Director  All right  Hold on a second while I check  Well  it looks like we did receive your announcement last Wednesday  Uh  looks like the editors must have decided not to include your event in this week s listings  
Student  Not included  Why  
Director  Well  we don t post things automatically  We get so many requests that we couldn t possibly post them all  So events that are thought to be too specialized  without the potential for really wide appeal    
Student  Wow  I got to say that does surprise me  What am I going to do now  I mean  he really is quite famous  I really do think there would be a genuine interest beyond my group  It would be a shame if no one shows up because there isn t enough publicity  Is there anyone else I can talk to  
Director  I don t think that would do you much good since we are already working on next week s schedule  But maybe you could ask the French department to post the announcement on its website  And maybe you could approach some other departments as well  you know  relevant ones  
Student  I knew we should have done a poster  But everybody was like  oh  you can just post it online  In any event  thanks for you help  It s something to consider  

TPO23 Lecture l  Archaeology  Antikythera  Mechanism 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class  
Professor  I was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics department the other day  and we ended up discussing how one discovery can change everything  My colleague mentioned how the theory of relativity completely changed the field of physics  At any rates  that conversation got me thinking about archaeological finds that really changed our understanding of ancient civilizations  So I want to talk about the discovery of the Antikythera Mechanism  
The Antikythera Mechanism was found a hundred years ago  under water in an ancient Greek shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea  It was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces  But once we figured out what it was and reconstructed it  Well  I simply don t have the words to convey how extraordinary this find was 
The Antikythera Mechanism is a relatively small device  roughly the size of a shoebox  made of gears fitted inside a wooden case  In its original state  there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top  with letters and drawings showing the Sun  the phases of the moon and different constellations  Inside the box  bronze gears would have rotated the displays  The displays  uh  the indicators of the Antikythera Mechanism  would then moved to show the motion of the Sun and moon relative to the planets and stars  The device could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more 
Well  scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the mechanism and re examine the other cargo in the ship wreck  and the evidence makes an absolute case that this device dates back to ancient Greece somewhere between 150 and 100 B C E  What makes that so fascinating is that before we found the Antikythera Mechanism  the earliest device we had that could track the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1 000 years later  So when this was first found  people literally would not believe it  Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B C E  But this physical evidence was conclusive  It was that old  
Of course part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera Mechanism is constructed of bronze  Now  it is not that bronze was all that rare in Greece then  it is just that bronze was valuable and could easily be recycled  It would have been relatively easy for a person with knowledge of metals to melt down bronze objects and forge them into   well  say  coins  Bronze was used to made money back then  Or mold the bronze into anything else of value for that matter 
We are very fortunate that the device ended up under water  because otherwise it probably would have ended up recycled into   who knows what  Now  it was a challenge to figure out the Antikythera Mechanism  It spent over 2 000 years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered  And even after it was discovered  it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was  You see  the mechanism had corroded underwater  and many of the gears were stuck together in a mass  Cleaning it was only partly successful  We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma rays were used to see inside  very similar to the way X rays are used to see your bones 
Now  once we got a good look inside  we saw a really complex device  The many gears not only moved in a way that could indicate the phases of the moon  The Antikythera Mechanism also tracked both the lunar year and the solar year  Additionally  the gears also moved to match the motions of the planet and predicted eclipses  But one thing that is particularly notable is that the mechanism was so precise that it even took into account a particular irregularity in the moon s orbit  which requires some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device 
You could say that the Antikythera Mechanism was a very precise calendar  which stands to reasons calendars were very important to ancient peoples  Religious festivals had to be held at the right time of year  crops needed to be planted at the right time as well  And let s not forget that eclipses in planetary motions had important symbolic meanings  


TPO23 Lecture2   Environmental Science  Earth Budget 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class  
Professor  Basically  a cloud either contributes to the cooling of Earth s surface or to its heating  Earth s climate system is constantly trying to strike a balance between the cooling and warming effects of clouds 
It s very close  but overall the cumulative effects of cloud are to cool Earth rather than heat it  And this balance between the amount of solar radiation  energy from the Sun  that s absorbed by Earth  and the amount that s reflected back into space  We call this Earth s radiation budget  And one way we keep track of the radiation budget is by looking at the albedo of the different surfaces on the planet 
A surface s albedo is the percentage of incoming solar energy  sunlight  that s reflected off that surface back into space  Oceans have a low albedo  because they reflect very little energy  Most of the solar energy that reaches the ocean gets absorbed and heats the water  Um    rainforests also have low albedos  Well  by contrast  deserts and areas covered by ice and snow  these places have high albedos  And clouds  in general  cloud also have high albedos  That means that a large percentage of the solar energy clouds receive is reflected into space 
OK  Now  when we say that clouds have a high albedo  We are talking about the effect of all the clouds on earth averaged together  But different types of clouds have different reflective properties  they have different albedos 
Student  So which type of clouds cools Earth  And which type heat it  
Professor  Well  high thin clouds contribute to heating while low thick clouds cool Earth  High thin clouds are very transparent to solar radiation  like  uh  clear air  So they mostly transmit incoming solar energy down to Earth  There s not much reflection going at all  At the same time  these clouds trap in some of Earth s heat  Because of the trapped heat  these clouds have an overall heating effect  
Student  Oh  OK  Since low thick clouds are not transparent to radiation    
Professor  Exactly  They block most of the solar energy so it never reaches Earth s surface  They reflect much of it back out into space  
Student  So that s how they contribute to cooling  
Professor  Yep  And as I said earlier  this cooling effect predominates  Now  what if there was a process that could control the type of clouds that form 
Student  Are you talking about controlling the weather  
Professor  Well  I am not sure I would go that far  But we recently noticed an increase in cloud cover over an area of the ocean waters around Antarctica  An increased area of low thick clouds  the type that reflects a lare portion of solar energy back to space and cools the Earth 
Well  the reason for this increased cloud cover  it turns out  is the exceptionally large amount of microscopic marine plants  Well  the current hypothesis is that these microorganisms produce a chemical  dimetho sulfide that interacts with the oxygen in the air  creating conditions that lead to the formation of the low thick clouds we observed  Well  that s true  It could have huge implications  So  maybe we are talking about controlling the weather  Perhaps  if the microorganisms near Antarctica really are responsible  perhaps we can accelerate the process somehow  

TPO 23 Conversation 2
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and his English professor  
Professor  Hi  Bob  How is it going  Are you enjoying the Introduction to Literature class  
Bob  Yeah  it s great  Araby  that short story by James Joyce we read last week  it was awesome  
Professor  I m glad you like it  Most of Joyce s work is very complex  A lot of students say that he is hard to understand  Normally  you wouldn t tackle Joyce in an Intro class  but I d like to give my first year students a taste of his style  his psychological approach to literature  because   mainly because it influenced other writers  I only wish we had more class time to discuss it  
Bob  Me too  So why did you pick Araby instead of some other story  
Professor  Well  um  first you should know that Araby is one of fifteen short stories by Joyce in a book called Dubliners  Uh  all the stories are related to one another  and they are set in the same time period  But Araby is the easiest one to follow  Though all the stories in the collection are written in stream of consciousness  which as you know  means they are told through the narrator s thought  through an inner monologue  as opposed to dialogue or an objective description of events  But Araby is easier because it s linear  the story unfold chronologically  
Bob  Still  I wish we could read whole novels by Joyce and discussed them in class  
Professor  That s what happens in my Master Writer Class  
Bob  Master Writer Class  
Professor  Yeah  I teach one on Joyce every spring  It s such a privilege  spending an entire term diving into a single body of work  And my students  they bring so much insight to the table that it s easy to forget who the professor is  
Bob  Oh  wow  That could actually solve my dilemma  uh  what I originally wanted to ask you   um  I am working on my schedule for next term  and I ve got room for one more course  and I d like to take more literature  Could I take your Master Writer Class on Joyce  
Professor  I m sorry  I should have mentioned  Uh  Master Writer is an advanced seminar  So students need to get a strong foundation in literary theory and criticism before I let them in the room  
Bob  But I have gotten really good grades on all my paper so far  I m sure I can keep up  Couldn t you make an exception  
Professor  Your grades are excellent  But in our intro class  you are reviewing the basics  like plots  setting and character and getting your first real exposure to different literary styles  
Bob  But why do I have to study different styles to understand Joyce s novels  
Professor  There are a lot of little details involved in interpreting literature  And like with Joyce  His novels have very unique structures  The only way to appreciate how you meet there is by studying a variety of authors  
Bob  Oh  OK  So could you suggest a different literature class then  
Professor  Sure  There s doctor Clain s course on nineteenth century novels  It s more focused than the class you re in now  But it will build on your current knowledge base and give you the background you need  That  plus a couple more foundational classes  and you will definitely be ready for my seminar  
Bob  Sweet  Thanks  



TPO23 Lecture3 Biology  Dolphins 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class  
Professor  We have been talking about how sea animals find their way underwater  how they navigate  and this brings up an interesting puzzle  and one I m sure you ll all enjoy  I mean  everybody loves dolphins  right  
And dolphins  well  they actually produce two types of sounds  Uh  one being the vocalizations you are probably all familiar with  which they emit through their blowholes  But the one we are concerned with today is the rapid clicks that they use for echolocation  so they can sense what is around them  These sounds  it has been found  are produced in the air filled nasal sacs of the dolphin  
And the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into the water  It s not as easy as it might seem  You see  the denser the medium  the faster sound travels  So sound travels faster through water than it does through air  So what happens when a sound wave um   OK  
You ve got a sound wave traveling merrily along through one medium  when suddenly  it hits a different medium  what does gonna happen then  Well  some of the energy is going to be reflected back  and some of it is going to be transmitted into the second medium  And   and   and if the two media have really different densities  like air and water  then most of the energy is going to be reflected back  very little of it will keep going  uh  get transmitted into the new medium  I mean  just think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater  
So  how did the dolphin s clicks get transmitted from its air filled nasal sacs into the ocean water  Because given the difference in density between the air in the nasal cavity and the seawater  we d expect those sounds to just kind of go bouncing around inside the dolphin s head  which will do it no good at all  If it s going to navigate it  needs those sounds to be broadcast and bounced back from objects in its path  
Well  turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads  just in front of their nasal sacs  called a melon  Now  the melon is kind of a large sac like pouch  made up of fat tissue  And this fat tissue has some rather fascinating acoustical properties  Most of the fat that you find in an animal s body is used for storing energy  but this fat  which you find in dolphins  and only in the melon and around the lower jaw  This fat is very different  very rich in oil  And it turns out it has a very different purpose as well  
Now  one way to um  modify the overcome this mismatch in the density of air and water would be   if you travels through velocity of the sound wave  make it precisely match the speed at which water  And that s exactly what marine biologists have discovered the melon Note that the bursa  these little projections at the rear of the melon  are right up against the air filled nasal sacs  And these bursa  it turns out  are what s responsible for transferring sound to the melon  
The sound waves are then transmitted by the bursa through the melon  First through a low velocity core  and then through a high velocity shell  where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater  So now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water  with minimal reflection  
The only other place  this special fatty tissue  like that in the melon  the only other place is found in the dolphin  is in the lower jaw  Turns out that the lower jaw  well  it is made of a specially thin bone  And it is very sensitive to vibrations  to sound energy traveling through the seawater  It turns out that the jaw is primarily responsible for capturing and transferring returning sound waves to the dolphin s inner ear  So these rapid clicks that are sent out bounce off objects  maybe a group of fish swimming over here  a boat coming from over there  The sounds bounce off them and the lower jaw captures the returning sounds  making it possible for the dolphin to sense what s in the surrounding water and decide where to swim  



TPO23 Lecture4 Choreography  Screen Dance 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a choreography class  
Professor  Now  when you think about choreography  well  uh  for your last assignment  you choreographed the dance that was performed on stage in front of live audience  Now  screen dance is very different  It is a dance routine you will be choreographing specifically to be viewed on a screen  on a computer screen  a TV screen  in a movie theater  any screen  So the question we have to ask is  what s the difference between choreography for a live performance and choreography for on screen viewing  
OK  Think for a minute  When you see a movie  is it just a film of people acting on a stage  Of course not  Movies use a variety of camera angles and creative editing  Movies can distort time  slow movement down  or speed it up  show actors fading in and out of scenes  etc  All of these   all of these film making techniques  things that can t be used in a live performance  are possible in a screen dance  Now  we ll cover these concepts in greater detail later  but you should be getting the idea that I don t want you to just film dancers on stage and turn it in as your screen dance project  Uh  Yes  Debbie  
Student  But isn t something lost here  Professor Watson  I am a dancer  and when I perform on stage  I am so energized by the audience s reactions  the applause  I actually  and for a lot of dancers  it   it really inspires us  
Professor  You re right  Screen dance  which is a relatively new  isn t for everyone  Uh  some dancers may seem reluctant to participate in your project  because they do thrive on the immediacy of performing live  If this happens  you could point out that screen dance offers other ways for dancers to connect to their audience  For example  dancers can express themselves  even change the whole mood of the scene through a facial expression  And you could film close up shots of their faces  Facial expressions aren t as important in live performances generally  because the choreographer knows that someone in the back row of a theater may not be able to see a dancer s face clearly  
Student  But   um  I have never used a movie camera or edited film before  How will we learn everything we need to know to     
Professor  Oh  don t worry  The cameras you will be using are pretty simple to operate  And you ll get to play with the film editing software several times before beginning your project  You ll also have the option of working with a student in the film department  someone who s familiar with the technology  But the choreography and the end result will be your responsibility of course  
Student  Could you talk some more about the film   making techniques  you know  the ones that work best forscreen dances  
Professor  I ll show some of my favorite screen dances next week to give you a better idea  But  uh  OK  Here s one technique that can create the illusion of flow in a screen dance  You film the same dancer  entering and exiting the frame several times  Moving slowly at first  then faster and faster  Then in the editing room  you can digitally manipulate these images  like you might put five or ten or twenty copies of that same dancer meeting himself in the middle of the screen  to make it look like he is dancing with himself  
Obviously  this can t be done in a live performance  Another example  in one screen dance I saw  the dancers leap through sheets of fire in a big abandoned building  Of course  the building wasn t really on fire  A technique called super imposing was used  The dancers were filmed and layered in the editing room  The fire was added to the background  
Student  That sounds awesome  But if anyone can watch a dance on a computer screen  Why would they pay to go see a live performance  What if screen dance got so popular that it replaced live dance  
Professor  Screen dance is an entirely different type of presentation  It could never replicate the immediacy  the kind of drama that live performance offers  There will be an audience for that  I think what screen dance will do  though  is heighten awareness of dance in general  Because it is a way   u h  it can reach people in their homes  in their workplaces  at anytime really  And if someone discovers that they love dance by watching a screen dance  there s a good chance they will get interested enough to buy a ticket to see a live performance

Conversation l Student & Clerk in the Bookstore
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and a clerk in the bookstore 
Student  Hi  Can you tell me where to find New Kind of Science  By  uh  by Stephen Wolfram 
Clerk  OK
Student     uh  I couldn t find it
Clerk  OK  Let me look it up on the computer for you  Who would you say the author was 
Student  It s a Stephen Wolfram 
Clerk  OK  Let s see    Hmm    no  it s not coming up  Hmm     I am not seeing it
Student  Um   hmm 
Clerk  This is for a course here at the university  right 
Student  Yeah  It s assigned reading for a class I am taking 
Clerk  It s for the semester  right  You are not buying it in advance for next year or anything 
Student  No  no  It s for a class I am taking now 
Clerk  Hmm   
Student  Oh  oh  you know what  Um  it s for a graduate class  Would that maybe make a difference  I mean  I am an undergrad  but I am just taking this one class in the graduate department  so   
Clerk  No  no  I don t think that s it  That shouldn t make any difference  But  hmm    let me see    maybe it s just   it could be that whoever that entered it misspelled the title or the author s name  so I can t find it on the computer and I can t tell if it s sold out  But if it s sold out  we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so 
Student  Well  uh  I was hoping to get it sooner because like we already have assignments and you know  I mean  I guess I can get it from the library 
Clerk  Right  of course  But I am trying to check  If we ve ordered more  then that back orders information should be in the computer too  Let s see    back order    Wolfram  Stephen     no  no  I am not seeing it  I am sorry  We just don t seem to carry it 
Student  Uh huh 
Clerk  This is odd though  What is   what s your professor s name  I could try searching for his or her classes in the database  That might help
Student  Um   OK  It s professor Kayne 
Clerk  K A N E 
Student  No  It s professor Kayne  K A Y N E  He s in the computer science department 
Clerk  Oh  It s for a computer science course  is it 
Student  Yeah 
Clerk  Well  that must be it  Computer science books are sold across the street in the computer bookstore 
Student  Are there signs up anywhere 
Clerk  I don t know 
Student  Maybe they should put some up  It could have save us both some time 
Clerk  Yeah  Well  anyway  I ll bet that s the problem  Check across the street  I ll bet they have it  But if not  come back  and I ll help you find it somewhere else  I can call around to see if other bookstores might have it  OK 
Student  OK  Thanks a lot  Bye
Clerk  Bye

TPO 24 Lecture l Biology  Crocodile Vocalization 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class 
Professor  OK  For today  let s look at a reptile  a predator that hasn t evolved much in the last seventy million years  No discussion of reptiles would be complete without some mention of crocodiles 
Now  we tend to think of crocodiles as  uh  kind of solitary  hiding out in a swamp  uh  kind of mysterious creatures  But we are finding out that they aren t as isolated as they seem  In fact  crocodiles interact with each other in a variety of ways  One way is with vocalizations  you know  sounds generated by the animal  This is true of the whole crocodile family  which includes crocodiles themselves  alligators  etc 
Take American alligators  If you were to go to a swamp during the breeding season  you d hear a chorus of sounds  deep grunts  hisses  these are sounds that male alligators make 
And some of them are powerful enough to make the water vibrate  This sends a strong  go away message to the other males  So the alligator can focus on sending other sound waves through the water  sound waves that you and I couldn t even hear since they are at such low frequency  But they do reach the female alligator  who then goes to find and mate with the male 
Vocalization is um   well  it is used for other reasons  like getting attention or just  um    letting others know you are distressed  Let s see  New born crocodiles  or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers  When they are born  croc    baby crocodiles have a sort of muffled cry while they are in their nest  Hatchlings are really vulnerable  especially to birds and small mammals when they are born  But their mother  who has been keeping vigil nearby  hears their cry for help and carries them to safety  meaning  to water  
So she takes them out of the nest  Uh  uh  all the eggs hatched at once  so she has about forty newborns to look after  Well  she takes about fifteen out of the nest at a time  carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water  While she is taking one load of hatchlings  the others wait for her to come back 
But do you think they are quiet about it  No way  They are clamoring for the mother s attention  sort of squeaking and practically saying don t forget about me 
I heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week  Anyone catched it  It had a few interesting bits  But you know  uh  you have to be careful  think critically  Sometimes I don t know where these shows find their experts 
Student  Excuse me  But  um    does all that crying defeat the purpose  I mean  doesn t it attract more predators 
Professor  Hmm   good question  I guess  well  I am guessing that once the babies have the mother s attention  they are safe  She s never too far away  and  and I think   I mean  would you mess with a mother crocodile 
So after the mother transports all the youngsters  they still call to each other  and to their mother  This communication continues right through to adulthood  Crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make 
There s   um   um… you have deep grunting sounds  hisses  growls  are many different sounds to interact or send messages  This is more typical of mammals than of reptiles  I mean  crocodiles  brains are the most developed of any reptile  In that sense  they are closer to mammals  brains than other reptiles  brains  And we know that mammals  dogs for example  dogs vocalize many different sounds  Crocodiles have a similar level of  uh  vocal sophistication  if you will  which makes them unique among reptiles 
Another thing would be  um  if a hatchling gets separated from the rest of its family  once the others get far enough away  its survival instinct kicks in  It will make a loud distress call  which its siblings answer  It calls again  And they continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again 
Another thing  something that wasn t on that TV show I mentioned  Um    mother crocodiles lead their young from one area to another  like when they have to find a different source of water  Usually she will lead them at night  when it is safer for them  moving ahead and then letting out calls of reassurance so that they will follow her  Her voice helps give the babies the courage they need to leave the area and go some place that s a more desirable home for them 

TPO 24 Lecture2 Art History  Modern Dance 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a dance history class 
Professor  As we have been studying  ballet  the classical ballet  is based on formalized movements  specific positioning of the arms  feet and the body  So  now let s move on to modern dance  also known as theatrical dance  Modern dance evolved in the late nineteenth  early twentieth century  and in most cases  audiences were very receptive to this radical new type of performing art 
Student  Um    what made modern dance so radical 
Professor  Well  for example  I think the best analogy to modern dance is modern art or modern music  Compared to their classical predecessors  these newer art forms are freer  more experimental  more improvisational  
Modern dance seeks to show how deep emotions and the music itself  how these intangible attributes can affect and inspire physical movement  and how movement can convey emotions to the audience  As I said  in classical ballet  emotions are conveyed through a set of strictly formalized movements 
Now  a pioneer of modern dance was Isadora Duncan  who was born in 1878  Isadora Duncan did study ballet briefly as a child  but she quickly developed her own unique style  which she called free dance  And by age fourteen  she was teaching her free dance to young children and giving recitals 
Her early dance technique was loosely based on the natural movements of children  running  skipping  acting out stories  also on motions from nature  waves crashing onto shore  trees swaying in the wind  Her expressive gestures were motivated from within rather than from being dictated by strict technique  Duncan also wore her hair down  ballerinas typically wear their hair in a tight bun behind the head  And instead of the short steep skirts and rigid toe shoes worn by ballerinas  Duncan wore loose  flowing tunics  and she dance bare foot  Now  that was something her audiences had never seen before 
Duncan performed in Paris composers  but avoiding set audiences  for the most part  and other European cities  dancing to the music of classical movements and steps  no two performances were alike  And adored her 
In 1904  she opened a school of modern dance in Berlin  And the next year she performed in Russia  But the Russian critics were not really kind  Some said Duncan s art form was closer to pantomime than to dance  But her style was a clear rebellion against ballet  and ballet is extremely important in Russia  A question  Julie 
Student  Yeah  What did Duncan have against ballet  I mean  she studied it as a child 
Professor  As a youngster  she might have found it too restrictive  uh  not creative enough  I think that feeling is exemplified by something that happened earlier in her career  in Russia  Duncan attended a ballet  and the lead dancer was the renowned Russian ballerina，Ana Pavlova  The following day  Pavlova invited Duncan to watch her practice  
Duncan accepted but was appalled by what she saw  To her  the exercises that Pavlova and the other ballerinas were doing seemed painful  even harmful  standing on tiptoe for hours  moving their bodies in unnatural ways  After seeing this  Duncan publicly denounced ballet as a form of acrobatics  uh  complicated and excruciating mechanism she called it  This critic generated I think some undue rivalry between ballet and modern dance  and it would take a long time  many years in fact  for the rivalry to calm down 


TPO 24 Conversation 2一Student & Geography Professor
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and his geography professor 
Student  Hi  Professor Brown 
Professor  Hi  Paul  What can I do for you 
Student  I have a question about the final exam  I mean  will it cover everything we ve done all term  Or just what we ve been doing since the mid term exam 
Professor  Everything we ve done all term 
Student  Oh  boy  You know  I am still not too clear about the hydrologic cycle  um  the transfer of water back and forth between the earth and the atmosphere  I really blew the question about it on the mid term exam  I want to do better on the final exam  But I am still having trouble with it 
Professor  Well  uh  have you been to the tutoring center 
Student  No  not for geography anyway  Isn t that just for when you need help with writing  like an essay or a research paper 
Professor  Oh  no  you can get tutoring in a lot of subjects  Some graduate students from this department tutor there  
Student  That s good to know  But I hardly go there because I have a part time job  I never seem to be free when they are open 
Professor  Well  they will be extending their hours when final exams begin  You might try then  But um    Well  since you are here now  can I help you with something 
Student  Well  the hydrologic cycle  I remember we went over a diagram in class  And from what I remember  water changes back and forth from water in lakes and oceans to vapor  and then back to water again when it falls as rain or snow  as precipitation  It s constantly being recycled through evaporation and condensation 
Professor  That s it  Basically  Um    so exactly what is it you don t understand 
Student  OK  I guess what I am really confused about is how the topography of the land  the mountains and valleys and stuff  affects precipitation 
Professor  OK  Good question  Precipitation is influenced by topography among other things  Um  why don t we talk about lake effect snow  It s a phenomenon that occurs anywhere you have a large lake that doesn t freeze and have cold air flowing over it  mostly in the Northern Hemisphere
Student  Like the great lakes in the United States 
Professor  Yeah  What happens is that the cold arctic air blows across the lake from the north in winter  And as the air crosses the lake  the lower layer is warmed by the lake water  which is much warmer than the arctic air  And as this air is warmed and picks up moisture  it becomes lighter than the air above it 
Student  So it starts to rise  right 
Professor  Yes  And clouds begin to form  When the air gets closer to the shore  it s slowed down by the land and starts to pile up  So it rises even faster because it has nowhere else to go  that s where topography comes into the picture 
Student  And then it snows because as the air rises  it cools off and loses its capacity to hold water vapor 
Professor  That s right 
Student  OK  Thanks  Any chance you ll have this question on the final 
Professor  I don t know yet  But you seem to have a handle on it 

TPO 24 Lecture3 Archaeology  Megafauna in North America 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class 
Professor  Between 11 000 and 10 000 B C E   North America was populated by a wide variety of great beasts  like mammoth and mastodons  both elephant like creatures with big tusks  and camels  giant sloths  the list goes on  By about 10 000 B C E   all those giant creatures  the Metgauna of North America were gone  We don t know exactly what happened to them  but there are some theories 
One theory is that they were hunted to extinction by humans  The humans who coexisted with these giant species in North America at that time were what we today called the Clovis People  And there is a Clovis site in a valley in southern California where the remains of thirteen mammoths were found  And spear points  tools for processing meat  and fire places 
That would appear to be some pretty compelling evidences  Mammoth bones have also been found at some other Clovis sites 
But then at other Clovis sites  there s also a lot of evidence that the Clovis people mostly gather plants and hunted small game  like rabbits and wild turkeys  Also there are several places in North America where you have natural accumulations of mammoth bones that look very similar to the accumulations at the Clovis site  except there s no human debris  where the mammoth almost certainly died as a result of some kind of natural disaster  So I think it is quite likely that those thirteen mammoths in southern California also died of natural causes  and that the Clovis people simply took advantage of the situation  Um   OK  That s the hunting theory 
Now let s look at another theory  uh  an alternative to the hunting theory  the climate change theory  At around 11 500 B C E ，the world was coming out of an Ice Age  And with that came increased seasonality  that is  the summers became warmer  and the winters actually became colder  These extreme shifts would have put a lot of stress on the bodies of animals that were used to a more moderate range of temperatures 
But the most important impact of this increased seasonality may very well have been its effect on the distribution of plants 
Today we take for granted that there horizontal bands of plant communities  In the far north  it is tundra  which gives way to forest as you move southward  And even farther south  grasslands take over  But during the Ice Age  these plant communities actually grew together  mixed with one another  So Ice Age animals had access to many different types of plants  different types of food  But when the seasons became more distinct  the plant communities were pulled apart  that meant  in any given area  there was less plant diversity  And as a result  uh  so the theory goes  the Ice Age animals that depended on plant diversity couldn t survive  And the great beasts were the ones that needed the most diversity in their diet  Again  we have what at first seems like a pretty attractive theory  but then  how do you explain the fact that this has happened before  You know  global cooling followed by global warming  and there was no extinction then 
Uh  you know  I recently read an interesting article about an archaeologist who tried to solve this puzzle with the help of his computer  What he did was  he wrote a computer program to simulate what would happen to mammoth under certain conditions  Say  for example  there is a drought for a couple of decades  or hunters are killing or five percent of the population  and so on  
One thing he found was that humans didn t necessarily have to kill these animals in great numbers in order to nudge them toward extinction  That s because very large animals have a slow rate of reproduction  so all you have to do is remove a few young females from the herd  and you can  fairly quickly  significantly reduce the population  And then he came up with a scenario that combined some hunting by humans with some environmental stress  and   Bang  The simulated mammoths were extinct within decades 
So it seems the mixture of hunting and climate change is a likely scenario  Uh  of course  computer simulations are not a substitute for hard evidence 
TPO 24 Lecture4 Astronomy  Shield Volcanoes on Venus 
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 
Professor  Many people have been fascinated about Venus for centuries because of its thick cloud cover  this so called planet of mystery and all of that  Well  what s under those clouds  What s the surface of the planet like  Some questions about the surface are still unresolved but  but we have learned a lot about it in the past several years 
First of all  let me talk about how we have been able to get past those clouds  First  there were Soviet modules2 that landed directly on the surface and sent back some images of what was around them  Second  we did some radar imaging from satellites from above  Radar can get through the clouds  So what have we learned  Yes  Karen 
Student  Well  I remember reading that there s not really a lot going on  that the surface of Venus is just flat and smooth in a lot of places 
Professor  Yeah  smooth in a lot of places  But that s not  um    that s not the whole picture  In other areas  you ve got canyons  ripped valleys  meteor craters  uh  lava domes  these lava formations that look like giant pancakes  And also volcanoes 
Well  one of the most interesting features on the surface are in fact the shield volcanoes  Shield volcanoes formed when magma comes out of the ground in the same spot over and over again  Remember  magma is hot molten rock that s underground  and it is called lava when it reaches the surface  Uh  so the lava builds up  and hardens  and a volcano forms 
Now  the lava on Venus is thin  It spreads out easily  So shield volcanoes have very gentle sloping sides  They are called shield volcanoes  because viewed from above  they kind of resemble shields  you know  like a warrior s shield 
But what s particularly interesting about these volcanoes is that most of the volcanoes here on Earth are not shield volcanoes  Instead  they are other volcano types  like strata volcanoes  for example  which are a result of tectonic plate movement  Remember tectonic plates 
Underneath the Earth s crust  there are a number of shifting slabs or plates that are slowly moving  And in the zones on the edges of the plates where different plates meet and interact  that s where we get most of Earth s volcanoes
On Venus  however  volcanoes are not clustered in discrete zones like they are on Earth  Instead  they are more or less randomly scattered over Venus s surface  Well  that s significant  Venus has mostly shield volcanoes  and they are randomly scattered  that indicates that Venus does not have moving tectonic plates  and that s a big difference compared to Earth  Here on Earth  moving tectonic plates are a major geological element  just crucial for the whole surface dynamic  right 
So why doesn t Venus have them  Well  there are a few theories  One of them is that this has to do with the fact that Venus has no surface water that s needed to kind of lubricate the movement of the plates  you know  like oceans on Earth  Yeah  I forgot to spell that out  Uh  Venus has no surface water 
Student  Wait a second  Did you say we have shield volcanoes on Earth  Can you give an example 
Professor  Sure  The volcanoes in the Hawaii islands  in the Pacific Ocean are shield volcanoes  They are formed over a hot spot of magma  So while on Earth we have several types of volcanoes  on Venus there s mostly the one type  Uh  Eric 
Student  Are the volcanoes on Venus still active 
Professor  Well  that s an interesting question  There is still some discussion on that point  But here s what we do now  First  the level of sulfur dioxide gas above Venus s clouds shows large and very frequent fluctuations  It is quite possible that these fluctuations  the huge increase and decrease of sulfur dioxide  happening again and again  It s quite possible that this is due to volcanic eruptions  because volcanic eruptions often emit gases  If that s the case  volcanism could very well be the root cause of Venus s thick cloud cover  And also we have observed bursts of radio energy from the planet s surface  These bursts are similar to what we see when volcanoes erupt on Earth  So this too suggests ongoing volcanic activity  But although this is intriguing evidence  no one s actually observed a Venus volcano erupting yet  so we can t be positive

Professor
Hi  Mark  What can I do for you 
Student
I am just filling out this approval for graduation form for the dean s office  and I don t know  I hope I will be able to graduate next semester 
Professor
Well  as long as you ve met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time  you shouldn t have any problem  Make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance and the electives too  
Student
Yeah  but as I look over the form  I got confused because of the way  um…they ve changed the requirements  So now I am not sure I will be qualified to graduate next semester  I know I would  before  under the old requirements  
Professor
Well  when the business department changed the curriculum to include more courses in international business  to     well  because of the increasing globalization of business  We made sure that students who have finished their second year  that is  those who are in their third or fourth year  wouldn t be affected  The new rules only apply to students in their first or second year  
Student
That s good to know  Uh    the department s hiring new faculty too I heard  to teach some of the new courses  But I want to    
Professor
Yes  One new faculty member has been hired  She will be teaching International Banking as a matter of fact  
Student
Actually  that s what I want to ask about   International Banking  I took International Banking l  but I never took International Banking 2  It used to be that the second semester of International Banking was an elective  but now it says it s a required class  
Professor
Yes  But that s one of the recent changes  So    
Student
Oh  Oh  OK  Oh  And     and I am planning to take a management course next semester  but I don t know if it s     if it will count toward my major 
Professor
What s the course 
Student
Organizational Behavior  
Professor
Yes  That will count toward your major  That s a difficult class  you know  But well worth it  So it looks like you will have all the required classes you need  You should be just fine  
Uh    I assume you have taken a seminar 
Student
Yeah  I took the marketing seminar  
Professor
OK  You are looking good  Just to be on the safe side  why don t you talk to someone in the dean s office before you give them the form  
Student
OK  So should I just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class  I don t have to take it 
Professor
Yes  You ve met the requirements for graduation  And if there s something I need to do     if I need to write a letter or whatever  just let me know 
Student
OK  Thanks  I ll let you know if I need that letter

One consequence of global warming is extinction  There s compelling evidence that global warming will be a significant driver of many plant and animal extinctions in this century  So we are considering various strategies to help some threatened species survive this unprecedented  this warming trend which  as you know  is caused mainly by greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels 
Um    the most radical strategy being debated among conservation biologists is Assisted Migration  Assisted migration means picking up members of a species  or members of a group of interdependent species and physically moving or translocating them  Um    translocating threatened species to a cooler place  to higher latitudes or higher elevations  for example 
Now  migration is a natural survival strategy  Over the past two million years  colder glacial periods have alternated with warmer interglacial periods  And so  um  in response to these gradual climatic swings  some species have shifted their ranges hundreds of kilometers 
So perhaps you are wondering why not let nature take its course now  Well  we can t  The main problem is today s fragmented habitats  During previous interglacial periods  when glaciers retreated  they left behind open land in their wakes  Today human development has paved over much of the natural world  Ecosystems are fragmented  Housing developments  highways and cities have replaced or sliced through forests and prairies  There are a few quarters left for species to migrate through without help  So conservationists are trying to save as many species as possible 
Now  assisted migration could become a viable part of our rescue strategy  but there are a number of uncertainties and risks  Without more research  we can t predict if Assisted Migration will work for any given species  A translocated species could die out from lack of food  for example  At the other extreme  we might successfully translocate the species  but within five or ten years that species could proliferate and become an invasive species  Like a non native plant that chokes out native plants by hogging the nutrients in the soil  Translocated animals can become invasive too  It happened in Australia  The cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying Australia s sugarcane plantations  But the cane toad itself became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent 
Also  many species are interdependent  intimately connected to one another  Like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relies on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil and on a certain insect for pollination  We probably have to translocate entire networks of species and it s hard to know where to draw the line 
And in addition to all that  it is not even clear that assisted migration or any migration for that matter  will help at least for some species  Earth was already in one of its warm interglacial periods when we started burning fossil fuels  And in the twenty first century  global temperatures are expected to rise two to six degrees  That rate of heating is far greater than during the last glacial retreat some 12 000 years ago 
Um     whether to use Assisted Migration  this debate is mostly within the biology community right now  But the ultimate decision makers  in the United States at least  will be the government agencies that manage natural resources  Assisted Migration really needs this level of oversight  and soon  Currently there s no public policy on using assisted migration to help species survive climate change  People aren t even required to seek permits to move plants or invertebrate animals around as long as they are not classified as pests  In one case  a group of conservationists has already taken it upon itself to try on their own to save an endangered tree  the Florida Torreya tree  through Assisted Migration 
There s only about a thousand individual Florida Torrey as left  And global warming is expected to significantly reduce or eliminate this tree s habitat  So this conservation group wants to translocate seedlings  Florida Torreya seedlings  500 kilometers north in order to expand the species  range  The group believed its effort is justified  but I and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out  because like I said  there could be unintended consequences 


Lecture2 Music History  Béla Bartók 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class 
Professor
So I just finished reviewing your papers on the influence of nationalism on the composers  music  And initially I was surprised none of you chose to write about Béla Bartók  that is until I remembered we haven t had a chance to discuss him in class yet  He was a wonderful and ground breaking composer 
Béla Bartók was a Hungarian  whose life stretched from the late nineteenth century to the middle of twentieth century  But he was not a fan of the Romantic style of music that was popular in his homeland during his youth 
Student
Wait  Hungary wasn t a country in 1900  was it 
Professor
You are right  I should have been clear  Bartok was born in Austria Hungary  a nation that broke apart when he was about forty years old  Actually  the town where he was born is presently part of Romania  The political history of that region is complex  Suffice to say that Bartok is generally known as a Hungarian composer 
So during Bartók s youth  the music played in the concert halls of Austria Hungary was dominated by Romantic pieces by mostly German composers  We discussed the Romantic style last week  These pieces were long and lyrical  They were meant to have a sort of grandeur about them  And in the early 1900s  composers who worked in the Romantic style were the most popular in Austria Hungary  But Bartok  he was part of the musical community that was trying to change this  And it led him to     well  the first thing it did was lead him to travel（此处，演讲者就是有语法错误，理解意思就行）  He looked at the countryside for the music of the farmers and the people who lived in small towns  and their music  well  you could say he discovered the music that was popular in those areas 
Student
What do you mean  
Professor
Well  all the music we have been talking about the past few weeks  it really was all in the cities  that s where the composers and the orchestras were  Out in remote areas of the countryside  in rural locations  music was more traditional  the same songs that were enjoyed by previous generations  Bartók went out  he travelled to a significant portion of Eastern Europe actually  He roamed the countryside and listened to the music heard in small towns and in all sorts of celebrations  He attended weddings  dances and religious ceremonies  where he heard a very different sort of music from the Romantic stuff being played in the concert halls in the cities  The music he heard is what we would consider folk music 
Student
And then he had those same songs played in the concert halls  
Professor
No  At first he went around to document the folk music  He really wanted to make sure the folk songs were written down before they disappeared  In fact  Bartók didn t start out the trip thinking of himself as a composer  He was an ethnomusicologist  He studied the traditional music of the region  But it turns out that what would later have a notable influence on European music on the whole  was the way Bartók used elements he heard in folk songs in his own compositions  He adopted a number of elements from what he heard  like unusual rhythms  And he liked to use the glissando as his hallmark  which he probably got from listening to Croatian folk music  A glissando is     well  I have got a recording of Bartok here  Let s wait until the music is fresh in our minds Susie  do you have something you want to ask first 
Student
Yeah  Before  you mention nationalism and…
Professor
Ah  right  yes  When Bartok had his new pieces performed  their folk music roots made them instantly popular  It happened to be a time of strong nationalism in Austria Hungary  so his compositions came at just the right time  He became very successful there  Particularly  when Bartok s ballet The Wooden Prince opened  there was great excitement for music that included musical elements from local folk songs  music that reflected the region s musical traditions  However  as popular as Bartok was in his homeland  he did not get much international recognition during his lifetime 

Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor  

Student
Well  you know  I am writing that paper about whales and the path they travel as they swim through the ocean  their migration patterns  
Professor
Yes  I remember  
Student
And well  I was thinking about it and I realized I don t understand how they hold their breath underwater  It s a little crazy for me to be writing about migration patterns without actually knowing how they stay underwater for so long 
Professor
Did you do any research to find out how they do it  
Student
Yeah  I did  I searched on the internet and there was a lot of information about whales  their habitats  the way they communicate  you know  their songs  But if there was anything about whales and how they hold their breath  I missed it  I ve got a bunch of books  Actually  I have got so much information  it s a little overwhelming 
Professor
I am surprised there is nothing about it in any of those books 
Student
Well  to be honest  I ve only skimmed them so far  I am still working on finding sources 
Professor
OK  I know I encourage everyone in class to look at a substantial number of sources  but I don t want you to get overwhelmed  Looking at a number of sources gives you a good knowledge base  but students only have a limited amount of time to work on each paper  I don t expect you to read a dozen books on whales for this assignment  Focus on just a few 
Student
Ok  Thanks 
Professor
You know  since you are already here  I can give you a quick summary of how whales hold their breath underwater  It s just a matter of certain adaptations in their anatomies  specifically in their circulatory system 
Student
So the blood flow is what makes the difference  
Professor
Yes  and in a couple of ways  First  blood makes up a larger share of a whale s weight than in other mammals 
Student
So they can store more oxygen because they have more blood 
Professor
Yes  but that s only part of it  They also have a greater capacity than land animals to store oxygen in their blood 
Student
So how does having more oxygen in their blood help them stay underwater longer 
Professor
It s the way the whale s blood carries oxygen to the rest of its body  Whales carefully conserve their oxygen when underwater in a couple of ways  When a whale dives  its metabolic rate drops  causing its heartbeat to slow down  And the blood flow to its muscles and some of its non vital organs  like its kidneys  is also cut off  A whale s muscles and non vital organs are able to function without oxygen for an extended period of time 
Student
I see  Well  now I can concentrate on my topic 


Lecture3 History  Egyptian Hieroglyphs 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history class  The professor has been discussing Egyptian Hieroglyphs 
Professor
Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the ancient Egyptian writings found in ancient Egypt on walls  monuments and on the inside and outside of temples  Hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 1600 years ago  And it mystified the most brilliant minds in the study of Egyptian artifacts and archaeology for many many centuries  Finally  the possibility of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery  in 1799  of the Rosetta Stone  
The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous archaeological artifact ever discovered  It contains the same exact text written in three different alphabets  Greek  demotic  hieroglyphic 
But we didn t even know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone contain the same information  And two of the three alphabets are ancient Egyptian scripts that stop being used  the hieroglyphic and the demotic the demotic script found on the Rosetta Stone  well  demotic was not as elaborate as hieroglyphic writing  It was used for more mundane matters  oh  like administrative documents  These ancient Egyptian scripts were replaced by Coptic scripts  But eventually  the Arabic language replaced Coptic and this cut off the linguistic link between ancient and modern Egypt 
Now  the Rosetta Stone was remarkable because as I said  on it  was the same text in three different alphabets  Greek  demotic and hieroglyphic  The Stone was essentially the dictionary that scholars needed to interpret the meaning of the hieroglyphs  And it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally decipher and understand what was written on the stone 
Thomas young  an English scholar  was the first to seriously attempt to decipher the symbols on the Rosetta Stone  He suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols  that they represented its sounds rather than pictures  Until then  all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs  that they symbolize objects or concepts  Thomas Young focused his attention on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word  the name of a King or Queen  He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler Ptolemy  since Ptolemy was also written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name  And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words  Strangely though  he gave into the dominant thesis of the day that hieroglyphs were pictographs  He actually dismissed his own findings as an anomaly because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek  not Egyptian  In other words  he figured it was an exception to the rule  It was phonetic because it was Greek  not Egyptian  How else could an Egyptian depict a Greek name other than spell it out  And that brings us to the hero of our story  Jean Francois Champollion 
Champollion built on Young s work  showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of Kings and Queens like Alexander or Cleopatra  But his critics noted that this was still not traditional Egyptian names  He hadn t done any more than Young had been able to do  so he couldn t disprove the dominant theory 
Then in 1822  Champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that contain traditional Egyptian names  The first two of these symbols were unknown  but Champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an  S  sound  He then drew on his linguistic knowledge to arrive at the solution to the problem  You see  unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to crack the code  Champollion happened to be fluent in Coptic  He wondered  and this was the real breakthrough  if Coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta stone  And if so  then perhaps that first disc shape symbol might represent the Sun  And the Coptic word for Sun is  ra   See where this is headed  So if the symbol were Coptic  the first symbol would be  ra   And then an unknown symbol followed by a double  S  sound  Was this  Champollion wondered  the name Rameses1  He was eventually able to confirm that it was  So  he had figured it out  Hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic  they represented sounds  not pictures  and the underlying language was Coptic  A lot of work remained  but Champollion had cracked the code  


Lecture4 Animal Behavior
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class 
Professor
All right  I hope you all had a chance to finish the assigned readings about animal play  because I want to spend some time discussing the different viewpoints presented in those articles  Let s start with the play as preparation hypothesis  Jerry  can you explain it  
Male Student
Yeah  Play as preparation  Young animals play in order to get really good at certain specific things they will need to do when they are adults  things like chasing  pouncing  climbing  In other words  they play in order to practice survival skills  like movements used in hunting and fighting  That hypothesis makes a lot of sense  like  maybe the most sense of all the theories we read about  
Professor
And what leads you to that conclusion 
Male Student
Well  like wolves  the young pups  they fight a lot and bite  you know  not to hurt each other  but     It just seems obvious why those wolf pups play like that  It gives them practice with skills that will make them better hunters or fighters as adults 
Female Student
Oh  I don t know about that  I mean  some of the things a young animal does while playing are totally different from the things they ll do as an adult  There was a really good example in the second article  I can t remember what it is called exactly  uh  self …
Professor
Self handicapping  
Female Student
Right  Self handicapping  Like during a fake fight  a play fight  if one of the animals is winning  the winning animal might just stop and give up its advantage 
Professor
Yes  And often it shifts to a submissive posture too  Of course self handicapping hardly ever happens in a real fight  Because in a real fight  well  the point is to win  So  this self handicapping  it is important to take this into account before just deciding to go with that first explanation  And in fact  there really isn t much in the way of solid experimental evidence to support the play as preparation hypothesis 
Female Student
What about the other one  The flexibility hypothesis  
Professor
Ah  yes  Let s talk about that  As you say  play is much more than just pretend fighting or practicing other adult behaviors  Apparently  it also contributes to the development of a brain that s flexible  a brain that s quickly able to get a handle on unfamiliar situations  This notion  the flexibility hypothesis  well  many of my colleagues find it quite persuasive 
Female Student
So  like with kids  a little kid might play a game with a friend  and then they might race each other across the field  So they are switching from one type of play to another  There s a lot of variety  I mean  they are learning to respond to whatever happens 
Professor
Well  that s the general idea  But let s hold off on talking about human behaviors from now  OK  According to the flexibility hypothesis  yes  the diversity  the variety in play can lead to a broader behavioral vocabulary 
Male Student
A broader behavioral vocabulary  Can you explain what that means  
Professor
Well  sometimes playing results in an animal doing something it would not normally do  That can lead to the animal learning to adapt  to come up with new behaviors that can help it cope with major problems later on  like staying safe or finding food 
Female Student
Yeah  And there was that brain study you had us read about too  
Professor
Oh  the one on how play affects development within the brain  
Female Student
Right  That s it  About the animals raised in an environment where they did not get opportunities to play 
Professor
Yes  Wasn t the conclusion interesting  That playing literally stimulates growth  creates connections within the brain  We need to do further studies  but   
Female Student
Excuse me  can we go back to play fighting for a minute  I am wondering  can the flexibility hypothesis really explain that  
Professor
Play fighting  Actually  that s something the flexibility hypothesis explains very well  Since play fighting includes variations in speed and intensity  and quick role reversals involved with self handicapping  An animal that s play fighting is constantly responding to changes  So it s earning to be flexible

Conversation1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university print shop employee 
Student
Hi  I saw your ad in the campus newspaper 
Employee
Oh  We don t have any job opening right now  
Student
Oh  no  I meant the other ad  about the services you provide for students  You see  I have been working at the campus tutoring center as a math tutor  But things have changed  including my schedule  And now I want to start doing tutoring work independently  But in order to  basically  start my own business  I need to get the work out 
Employee
Ok 
Student
I was thinking I should get something printed up that I can hand out to people 
Employee
Ah  Well  actually  I just printed up some great looking flyers for someone doing the same thing 
Student
Flyers  Yeah  that s an idea  I guess then I could post them around the campus 
Employee
Yeah  And you can hand them out too  But  oh  you know what  I did something really neat for someone last week  She didn t want to go the traditional route  you know  business cards  flyers  so we customized pencils for her 
Student
Pencils 
Employee
Yeah  You know  a little message printed on the pencil 
Student
Oh  that s cool 
Employee
Yeah  But you should know  it s not our cheapest option  Oh  and you know those little sticky notes 
Student
You do those too 
Employee
Well  we did once  I think those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters  You know  student use them all the time  so they should be good for business  I don t know why we haven t done more 
Student
Wow 
Employee
So you ve got some options 
Student
Right  Well  what about business cards  My friend has these business cards  She does tutoring too  And she got them at this place in town  but they were kind of expensive 
Employee
For business card  Well  I don t know what your friend paid  But we could do something real simple and it wouldn t be much  Like for a batch of 250 for one of our standard designs  20 dollars maybe 
Student
20 dollars sounds okay 
Employee
Now  there are some other choices that ll affect the cost  You know  like different background patters  using color ink  that sort of thing  And it also depends on how many words you want to include 
Student
Ok  Well  I know what I want them to say  But I am just thinking  I kind of like that pencil idea 
Employee
Yeah  I thought it was neat  Now  of course you can only fit your name and phone number  and like  in your case  math tutoring on it 
Student
Right  Well  I could custom design the business cards through  right  That s what my friend did  She said she designed them at the computer right there at the print shop 
Employee
Well  you can do that here too  But a custom design would be a bigger investment for your business than one of our standard designs 
Student
Well  I don t know  I am interested in business cards  so can I look at the standard designs 

Lecture1  Advertising  Green Marketing 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an advertising class 
Professor
Last class someone asked about green marketing  Green marketing refers to companies promoting the products as environmentally friendly  Companies often turn to advertising experts to help them do this 

Green marketing seems recent  but advertising professionals grew interest in it several decades ago  The seeds for green marketing were probably planted in 1970  when the first Earth Day took place  Rallies all over the United States were organized to protest environmental degradation  Some 20 million demonstrators participated in that first Earth Day  And it helped spark dozens of environmental laws  The biggest was the Endangered Species Act of 1973  which protects imperiled animal species from extinction  There was also passage of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act was strengthened 

Earth Day  Environmental Laws  Environmental Issues in the news  Being Green was entering the mainstream  And business started saying  hey  we can get involved in this  So in 1975  a major advertising trade group held its first workshop on ecological marketing  A few years later  we began seeing ads tapping into people s environmental concerns 

But some green marketers learned the hard way  green marketing must still involve all the same principles of a traditional marketing campaign  You ad must attract attention  stimulate consumers  interest  create a desire for your product  and motivate people to take action to buy your product 

So let me tell you about one green marketing campaign that failed at first and explain why  It was a compact fluorescent light bulb  We ll call it the eco light  It was first introduced  I believe  in the late 90s  It cost far more than a regular incandescent bulb  The advertising message was  basically   use this eco light and save the planet   But that message wasn t effective  Research shows that consumers don t want to let go off any traditional product attributes  like convenience  price and quality  Even though surveys indicate that almost everybody cares about the environment 

So the company reintroduced the eco light with a new message  one that emphasized cost savings  which the eco light lowers electric bills and lasts for years  So it s good for earth  cost effective and convenient because it doesn t have to be changed every few months  This ad campaign worked like a charm 

Something else  uh  the company that makes the co light  researchers would consider it an  extreme green company   not only because its product are energy efficient  but because the company tries to reduce its environmental impact in other ways too．Like in addition to selling Earth  friendly products  its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and use all sorts of recycled materials．A company that only recycles office paper  researchers would classify as a   lean green company ．And there are other degrees of greenness in between．

So if your green marketing strategy s gonna work  your message should be valid on all dimensions．When a company as a whole is credited for reducing its environmental impact  this can lead to brand loyalty．People will come back and buy your product more and more．However  let s say you re fine for violating the Clean Water Act while manufacturing products from recycled materials  The public would eventually find out．You can t just make the claim that a product is environmentally friendly and not follow through on．




Lecture2 Biology Carbon Cycling 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class
Professor
OK．Just before the end of the last class  we started talking about trace metals  metals found in living organisms in very small quantities that serve an important biological  important nutritive function in those organisms．And one trace metal that serves a nutritive function is zinc．

Zinc assists in a number of processes in humans  but we are going to focus on just one  one that applies to a number of organisms  not just humans．See  zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling  the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon  Iike carbon dioxide  into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use．So  take respiration．Our bodies  our cells produce carbon dioxide when they
break down sugars．We need to get the CO2 out of our bodies  so the CO2 is converted into carbonic acid  which the blood is able to carry to the lungs．Once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs  it s converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out．

Now  this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme．Uh  who remembers what an enzyme is  Bob 
Student
Uh  it s a protein  a specific kind of protein  one that speeds up chemical reactions 
Professor
Exactly．Different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions．Now  the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it．So this zinc enzyme is critical for getting CO2 out of our bodies through the lungs．And it s also extremely important for plants．Bob  can you tell us why 
Student
For making food  for photosynthesis 
Professor
Exactly．For photosynthesis．Plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans．So zinc is also important for plants．

OK．But zinc is scarce in certain environments．And it s particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans  which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all．In fact  there are a lot of marine plants that survive  that grow and reproduce in surface waters．In particular  there are a lot of diatoms．
Diatoms are microscopic  photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean．There are a number of different types of diatoms  and  well  diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process  because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean．The carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten  say  by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean  or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor 

So how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce  Well  recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a different enzyme that serves the same purpose．But this enzyme doesn t contain zinc．Instead this new enzyme incorporates another trace metal  cadmium．Kelly  you ve got a question 

Student
Yeah．I thought cadmium was toxic．Didn t you say that 
Professor
It is poisonous to humans．Uh  actually  we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life  that it didn t serve any biological purpose．But new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc  that organisms can use it instead of zinc when there isn t enough zinc in their environment．

Now  the discovery of this cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons．It s actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium．So it s possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes  that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce．And there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmium
to cycle carbon．

But there s something else to think about．What is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere  one of the major culprits in global warming．Carbon dioxide  right 

Now  if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface  converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean  well  maybe there s more to that whole process  that cycle  something that we ve overlooked．So further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too．

Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her biology professor．
Professor
Hi  Jean．How was the…uh  the conference  right  the conference on volunteerism  That s where you were last week．
Student
Yeah  It was great  I met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area．Now it would be a lot easier to get students to volunteer in the community．Plus  I ve never been to any of the beaches here before．Being at the beach was definitely a plus．
Professor
Well  I hope you had time to look over the notes from the class you missed．You did get the notes  right 
Student
Yup．I II look them over before tomorrow s class．
Professor
Good．And let me know if you have any questions 
Student
Well  there is something that I wanted to ask you now．It s about something I noticed at the beach．
Professor
Oh  what s that 
Student
Well  see  there are a lot of jellyfish there  floating in the water 
Professor
That couldn t have been pleasant 
Student
Not for swimming  But it was interesting  I mean  the jelleyfish were glowing．I swear they were．And I am wondering what that s about．
Professor
Ah  glowing jellyfish．That is interesting  Uh  it s called bioluminescence．And actually we are going to talk about it later in the semester．Basically  bioluminescence is light that s produced by a chemical reaction 
Student
Really  Inside the jellyfish 
Professor
Well  not all jellyfish  about half of them．Actually  a lot of marine organisms have this ability  especially in deeper parts of the ocean．
Student
Oh  I get it  Like the darker it gets  the more the fish needs light  right 
Professor
Well．bioluminescence serves a number of functions．Most aquatic organisms use it for communication and for attracting prey．But jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators．Some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators  to  uh  to startle them．But jellyfish closer to the surface  probably like the jellyfish you saw  they use bioluminescence to hide．The light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight  so they blend in  and  uh  and predators can t see them．
Student
Wow  really  Well  I am looking for a topic for my term paper  so maybe I could do it on these glowing jellyfish．That s why I wanted to ask you about them  you know  to find out if there was really something to write about．
Professor
It s a great topic．But you II have to make sure the topic is manageable．Like I said  about half of all jellyfish are bioluminescent  so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence in the same way  or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence  on  on the chemical process  or…Here s an idea．You seem to be very involved in local issues．See if you
can identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the local ecosystem．
Student
Yeah  you know  some of the environmental groups I met last week might even be able to help me．





Lecture3 Astronomy  Comets 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 
Professor
0K．We have been looking at some of the smaller members of our solar system  comets．You already know about the structure of comets．Let s continue our discussion now by talking about orbits  especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets．These are the comets that circle around the Sun pretty regularly．They return again and again  predictably  after a certain period of time．That s why we say their orbits are periodic．Probably the most famous and brightest of these is Halley s comet．

Halley s comet comes from far out in the solar system  goes in close to the Sun  and then out again．At its closest approach to the Sun  Halley s comet is about twice as close to the Sun as Earth is．And at its farthest．It s about thirty five times farther from the Sun than we are  which puts it out beyond Neptune  Basically  the idea here is that a periodic comet  with its very elongated orbit  just keeps coming back around again and again．With Halley s comet  well  it returns every 75 years  roughly．

But where is Halley s comet during most of this time  Well  like all orbiting bodies  a comet moves faster when it s closer to the Sun．So it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood  inside the orbit of Jupiter．Most of its time is spent way out beyond Jupiter s orbit  poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit．Because of this  we can only see Halley s for a few months every 75 years  first on its way in toward the Sun  and then on its way out again．

Now  you remember from our previous discussion that a comet s nucleus  its core  is made up of ice and dust  like a frozen snowball．And as it approaches the Sun  it starts to heat up．And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus．The gases that vaporize from the comet  the comet never collects them back again  so on every orbit  the comet leaves part of itself behind．

OK．How old is this solar system  Four and a half billion years．remember  And Halley s is going around the Sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time．So the comet should be long gone by now  right  I mean  how come Halley s is still there  After four and a half billion years．How could it be  Well  the answer is that this comet hasn t always been in such a short periodic orbit  since once a comet gets into
an orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently．Well  that comet s probably not going to be around too much longer  So this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet s life．A phase that just precedes its final breakup．We ve seen comets do that  going toward the Sun and then come back around  torn into pieces．

But lots of comets aren t like that．They come in  pass behind the Sun  and then travel back out．But with an orbit so large  and its farthest place so far away from the Sun that we just don t know how far out it goes．We just can t determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see．So these are often called parabolic orbit comets．Parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end．Actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the Sun eventually  but the period might be tens of thousands of years．And basically  we can t determine it．So we just  we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets．

So  what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the Sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor  Well  gravitational interaction with planets  right  lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to Jupiter or Saturn or one of the other planets  then the pull of that planet s gravity might alter the orbit  maybe make it much shorter．So this comet  if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way  it can be drawn into a new orbit  one that ll capture it and keep it coming back around the Sun much more often．




Lecture4 Art Conservation  Archimedes Palimpsest 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art conservation class 
Professor
So far we have been talking all semester about restoring and preserving pieces of art，like ancient frescos，early oil paintings，etc．But although our field is called art conservation，it also involves…what 
Student
Um．．．preserving other types of cultural materials too
Professor
Very good．Not just art．Old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies  all contain important historical information．In fact，let me give you an example．You ve heard about the Greek scholar Archimedes，who lived more than 2，000 years ago，I am sure．Archimedes was a great mathematician．For example，he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere．Not much of his work has Survived，but what has Survived is brilliant．And then in 1906，a Palimpsest of Archimedes  writing was discovered．

Now  a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that s hidden because something else was written over it later．I ll explain in a minute．This Archimedes palimpsest  as it s now called，is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen．Because it contains the only known existing copy of Archimedes treatise  called Method．Archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems  which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere，for example．This maybe commonplace today  but was revolutionary in his time．A few years ago  the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars．It could have ended up tucked away in a private collection，but fortunately  the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word Archimedes wrote，so the contents can be shared with the world and studied．

But there are two main problems．What do you think the first one might be 
Jennifer 
Student
Um…well，it sounds like it s extremely old．So probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust 
Professor
True．And some are moldy  and some were eaten away at by bookworms．This thing s really decayed．But on top of that，there s another issue．And this is the reason why it s a palimpsest．You see，the text apparently sat around in a library in Constantinople until 1229 A．D．But then a scribe erased，scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on．Why would he
do that  Take a guess．
Student
Must have been a paper shortage 
Professor
Well  they used parchment to write on  but yes  there was a parchment shortage．
Student
So you are saying the parchment was basically recycled 
Professor
Correct．Then，even later on，in the twentieth century  a forger painted
ancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value．So unfortunately  that s quite a history．
Student
But professor Wilkens，if the scribe scraped away Archimedes  words and if these paintings covered the pages，how can the original work be recovered 
Professor
Ah  that s why I am telling you the story．That s our task as conservationists  isn t it  To find a way．There were still faint traces of Archimedes  words on the pages．First，we tried to make the Archimedes  words stand out with a variety of technologies，using ultraviolet light．But that didn t work on every page．But then，there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach．
Student
Spinach 
Professor
Yes．Spinach．This physicist，Uwe Bergman，does research that involves studying iron in spinach．He was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original Archimedes  ink．So he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages．And his idea worked．Bergman s technique allows X rays to pass through the forged paintings  pass through the scribe s writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original Archimedes  text and create an image just of the iron on the pages．The iron based letters seem to just pop off the page．The original text and diagrams emerged，line by line．diagram after diagram  And that s kind of typical of our field．There s a lot of interdisciplinary work．People from several different fields might be
involved in working with a single art．

Hi  Can I help you 

Student
Where do I go  besides the computers  to look for books on New Zealand  

Librarian
OK  You mean you don t want to use the computer 

Student
Well  I haven t had any luck on the computers here 

Librarian
OK  I mean the reason I am asking is you pretty much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is  But I can help you find it on the computer if you like 

Student
That would be great  I just spent half an hour and I couldn t find anything  

Librarian
I know how you feel  When I first started working here  I couldn t find anything either  So you are looking for information on New Zealand  is that right 

Student
Yes 

Librarian
Is it like travel information that you are looking for 

Student
Uh… No  Actually what I am looking for is information on a volcano in New Zealand 

Librarian
Oh  OK  Because I know a travel agency that specializes in tours in New Zealand and Australia  

Student
Oh  I d love to go  I heard it s beautiful  

Librarian
Yeah 

Student
Maybe someday  

Librarian
Yup  OK  Let s see … OK  If you want to search the library holdings and don t know the author s name or the exact title of the book or an article  you have to set up a keyword search  It is a special function  Then you can just type in some keywords and let the computer do the search  

Student
I see 

Librarian
OK  Oh  how about if we search for volcanoes and New Zealand 

Student
Sounds good 

Librarian
It s for a geology class 

Student
Mhmm 

Librarian
Ha  You must be from Professor Simpson s class 

Student
No 

Librarian
Oh  Well  he is a volcano expert  so I thought he might be teaching your class 

Student
No  I ve heard he is really good though 

Librarian
Yeah  That s what everyone says  Do you know the name of the volcano  

Student
Mount Ruapehu 

Librarian
Can you spell that 

Student
Sure  It is R U A P E H U  

Librarian
OK  Mount Ruapehu  Let s see  So are you a geology major 

Student
Hem  Hardly 

Librarian
Let me guess  you have to take a science course and you don t want to have to deal with biology  chemistry or physics 

Student
Exactly  But it s actually turned out to be a pretty interesting class 

Librarian
Well  that s good  Um… does it have to be a book  Or could you use a journal article  

Student
Mhmm… no  either one would be fine  

Librarian
OK  Well  here s a journal article  Let me check to see if we have it  OK  We have the article  but it is from 2001  Is that OK  you think  

Student
Well  I d like to have a look at it  The focus is really on eruptions in the last five years  but it might have some useful background material 

Librarian
OK  Well  let s see what else we can find  

Student
Sounds good 




Lecture1 Marine Biology  Coral Reefs 

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class 

Professor

So we have been fairly thorough in our discussion about coral reefs  which of course are prominent  oceanic features made of hard limestone skeletons produced by tiny coral animals  We ve gone over where coral reefs are usually formed – along the edges of shallow ocean banks in tropical or subtropical regions  and the fact that they are declining at an alarming rate  But I don t want to leave you with the impression that all is lost  There are several techniques being employed today that could prove useful in assuring the future of the reefs  

Now  we ve talked in depth about coral bleaching  or whitening  which as you recall  is a symptom of …well that the coral is suffering  As you know  coral is very sensitive to water temperature  Even though one or two degree Celsius rise in sea surface temperature for a relatively short amount of time can cause bleaching  Recently  researchers have used data collected by monitoring surface water temperatures to improve the ability of a reef to recover from bleaching  One future possibility is that improved monitoring can help predict where and when bleaching will occur  which might potentially enable us to mitigate its effects  

And there s another technique that s been experimented with to try to help coral reefs recover from bleaching  It s called coral transplantation  This involves moving young coral from a healthy reef onto a degraded reef  you know  in an attempt to regenerate the degraded reef by encouraging young healthy coral to take over  There has been some success with this  but it s still somewhat controversial  Some scientists support it because  well for one thing  it means you don t have to rely on the existing coral to reestablish itself because it might not be able to  But in my opinion  transplanting coral should only be used as … well as a last resort  I mean  this method is not only costly but it s … well even if it s successful  it still fails to address the ongoing problem  the root causes of the degradation  which really is paramount to devising an effective solution  So I don t really take comfort in the successes they have had with transplantation  

Perhaps some more constructive use of our time could be spent at researching corals that do survive  like in areas known as refugia  Refugia are areas on the reef that are seemingly  well resistant to bleaching  See  when coral reefs experience bleaching  it s rarely a case of the whole reef being affected  There are almost always pockets of coral on the reefs that remain unaffected  And these are often the lower areas of the reef  those located in deeper water  where temperatures are lower 

Now  we have evidence that corals in these locations are able to escape the destructive bleaching that affects portions of the reef in shallower or warmer water  So in my mind  it s these refugia that are the key components of overall reef resilience  These should be the area of concentration for researchers to locate and protect those regions as a way to sustain coral reefs  

And we can also protect the reefs by protecting the surrounding ecosystems  like mangrove forests and seagrass beds  Both of these grow in coastal waters  often in the vicinity of coral reefs  By protecting these areas  we also protect the coral  Let s take  for example  the mangrove forests  Mangrove root systems have the ability to absorb and well trap sediments and pollutants in water that flows through them before they enter the ocean  This of course has beneficial results for the nearby coral reefs  

And fishery s management is another key strategy  Overfishing can be seriously disruptive to coral  Let me give you a couple of examples  Overfishing certain species of fish and shellfish like snappers  barracudas and even lobsters  Well all of these creatures feed on snails  worms and other organisms that eat coral  So depleting the number of lobsters  for example  means that we are adding to the threat of coral decline  Sea urchins are another example  They eat algae and prevent it from overwhelming the coral  Since the disappearance of sea urchins from the waters up the coast of South Florida  many coral reefs there have been smothered by the uncontrolled growth of algae  
Lecture2 History of Musical Instruments  Violins 

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history of musical instruments class  

Professor

So musical instruments evolved in ways that optimize their acoustical properties  how the instrument vibrates and sends those vibration through the air to our eardrums  

Now professional musicians are very particular about their instruments  they want instruments that help them fully express the intent of the composer  which of course translates into a more enjoyable listening experience for the audience members  Yet most audience members probably aren t even aware of how much the instrument matters  I mean  OK  Think about the last concert you attended  When you applauded  what went through your mind 

Student 

I recently heard a violinist who totally blew me away  So when I applauded  I guess I was showing my appreciation for his skill  the hours of practicing he must have put in  

Professor

And his violin  

Student 

Didn t really think about it  It looked exactly like mine  which is inspiring in a way knowing my violin could also produce beautiful tones  that maybe I would sound that good someday  

Professor

I hope you do  But if your violin isn t as good as his…

Student 

You mean he might not sound as good playing my violin  

Professor

As I said  tone quality differs from instrument to instrument  The question is why  Why does one instrument sound more beautiful than another  even if they look identical  

There s a particularly interesting case with an extraordinary generation of violins made in Northern Italy  in the city of Cremona  back in the late 1600s   early 1700s  These vintage Cremonese violins are considered the best in the world  But it s not like the makers of those violins were any more skilled than their modern day counterparts  They weren t  Today s top violin makers can pretty much replicate all the physical attributes of a Cremonese violin  But it s generally thought that the acoustical quality of modern violins doesn t live up to the quality of the vintage ones  

Student

So what attributes of the old violins have been replicated  

Professor

Oh  their dimensions  shape  their fingerboard height  uh  general craftsmanship  For a long time  people thought the varnish used to coat and protect the violins was special  But research showed it was the same ordinary varnish used on furniture  However  researchers have discovered that there are something special about the wood the violins were made from  And recently they have been able to replicate that too  

Student

How  Unless the trees that Cremonese used are still alive  

Professor

The trees weren t replicated  just the wood  specifically the wood s density  Density is determined by how trees grow  Trees  old trees that don t grow in the tropics grow seasonally  they grow faster early in the year in the springtime than they do later in the year  So early growth wood is relatively porous  Late growth wood is denser  less porous  And this variation shows up in the trees growth rings  The denser layers are generally darker than the less dense layers  We call this variation the density differential  Variations in wood density affect vibrations  and therefore  sound  When scientists first analyzed the wood of vintage Cremonese violins in compared with the modern violin wood  they calculated the average density and found no difference  Later  other researchers measured the density differential and found a significant difference  Modern violins had a greater variation  a larger differential  

Student

So you mean the density of the wood in the Cremonese violins is  is more uniform 

Professor

Correct  

Student

But Northern Italy isn t in the tropics  

Professor

No  But climate matters  Turns out the Cremonese violins were made from trees that grew during a Little Ice Age  a period when temperatures across Europe were significantly lower than normal  So the trees grew more evenly throughout the year  making the density differential relatively small  

Student

But you said someone replicated the Cremonese wood  

Professor

The density differential was replicated  

Student

What did they do  Try to simulate an Ice Age climate in their greenhouse and grow some trees in there 

Professor

No  what happened was a material scientist figured out a way to process wood to make it acoustically similar to the Cremonese wood  He basically exposed the wood to a species of fungus  uh  a mushroom  In the forest  fungi are decomposers  They break down dead wood  But this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood  leaving other layers alone  As a result  the density differential of the fungi treated wood approach that of the Cremonese wood  

Section2

Conversation2 Hydroponics  Chinampas 

Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and the professor of his history of technology class  

Student
Would it be okay to focus on something related to agriculture 

Professor
Sure  farming technology is fine  as long as it s pre modern  But this isn t a long paper  so are you going to need to pick a specific area of pre modern agriculture  like irrigation or food crops of ancient Greece  

Student
I am actually interested in hydroponics 

Professor
Hydroponics  Growing plants in water instead of soil  

Student
Well  not in pure water  in water that has the proper mix of nutrients 
 
Professor
OK  But is it a pre modern technology  I mean  hydroponics isn t really my specialty but from the research I have read  we are talking the nineteenth century  maybe the seventeenth century if you really stretch it  

Student
Oh  But the Aztec civilization back in the thirteenth century in basically where Mexico city is today … An article I read said the Aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called … I have got the word right here  Um  Chinampas  

Professor
Chinampas  the so called floating gardens 

Student
Exactly  So yeah the chinampas  the article said very clearly these floating gardens are proof that the Aztec invented hydroponic farming  

Professor
Well  chinampas are artificial islands built up in shallow lakes  Islands made from packed earth and weeds and uh  material from the bottom of the lake  They may have appeared to be floating in the water  but in fact they reach all the way to the bottom of the lake  So the primary growing medium  what the plants draw nutrients from  is actually soil  not water  

Student
So the article was wrong about that  Too bad  it seems like a great topic  but I guess…

Professor
Wait a minute  Just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn t mean this couldn t be an appropriate topic for your paper  Chinampas were still a great technological achievement  I mean  they enabled the Aztecs to grow plenty of food in an area without much available farmland 

Student
But I wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic  

Professor
Well it s pretty common for writers to generalize  say use a term like hydroponics to describe other types of agriculture  Personally  I would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in liquid  The crops on chinampas definitely benefited from the water surrounding them  But… hydroponic…

Student
OK  So I will go with chinampas but leave out with the hydroponics part  


Professor
Actually  there s an important lesson here  We should pay attention to what happened in history but also how historical events are presented  Why  for example  would writers use a word like hydroponics so casually  

Student
I guess  cause it s a popular topic people want to read about 

Professor
Or to help modern day readers to understand something historical  maybe these writers think a familiar frame of reference is needed 

Student
Well that article was in a popular magazine  not a scholarly journal for historians 

Professor
OK  But historians sometimes do the same thing  

Student
So I guess then that all historians might not describe chinampas in quite the same way either 

Professor
Good point  Why not look into that too  And include it along with your description and analysis  Lecture3 Zoology  Sauropods 

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a zoology class  

Professor

Your reading for today touched on dinosaur fossils from the Mesozoic era  which ended about 65 million years ago  Today we will be discussing the sauropods  I think our discussion of sauropods will illustrate what we can learn by comparing the fossil record to modern animals  By fossils  we mean traces of prehistoric animals such as bones  which become mineralized  or impressions of bones or organs that are left in stone  

Now sauropods were among the largest animals to exist ever  They were larger than blue whales  which are the largest animals alive today  They weigh up to one hundred tons  twenty times as much as elephants  Also  they were an extremely successful kind of dinosaur  There s evidence of sauropods in the fossil record for an unusually long time  over one hundred million years  

So  why were sauropods so successful 

Biologically speaking  sauropods shouldn t have been successful  Large animals like elephants  say  they require much more food and energy and have fewer offspring than smaller animals  This makes maintaining a population harder  The largest animals today don t live on land  But in the ocean where food is easier to find  a blue whale  for instance  can eat up to 8 000 pounds of food a day  And they give birth only once every few years  We also know that body heat  that… well  large animals can t easily get rid of excess body heat  But for an oceangoing whale  that s not a problem  For a 100 ton land animal  it can be  

For years  we have assumed it was the abundant plant life of the Mesozoic that allowed these giants to thrive  However  we now know that since oxygen levels were much lower in the Mesozoic than we assumed  there was much less plant life for sauropods to eat than we thought  

So now  well  we are looking at other… we are  we are trying to understand the biology of sauropods  comparing their fossils to the anatomy of modern animals to get a better idea of how they lived  What we ve found is that sauropods were experts at conserving energy  They had enormous stomach capacity  the ability to digest food over a long period  converting it to energy at a slower pace  saving it for later  For animals with small stomachs  it takes lots of energy to constantly look for food and then digest it  With larger stomachs and slower digestion  you don t need as much energy  Joseph 

Student
 
Does… do scientists actually know about sauropods from looking at… I mean  how much can we actually learn looking at some ancient bones compared to all we can learn from modern animals  And  comparisons between animals that lived millions of years apart  well  it just seems… more like guessing  

Professor

There s always some guesswork when studying extinct animals  But that s exactly what leads to discoveries  a hypothesis  a type of guess is made  We guess the hypothesis by looking for evidence to support it  Then some questions are answered  which may lead to new questions  For example  let s look at one of these comparisons  

We know sauropods couldn t chew food  Their skulls show they had no chewing muscles  Lots of modern animals  like birds and reptiles  also can t chew food  They need to swallow it whole  But modern animals have an interesting aid for digesting food  They swallow stones  stones that are used to help grind up the food before it s actually digested in the stomach  These stones are called gastroliths  Gastroliths make food easier to digest  essentially smashing food up  just as we do when we chew  Over time  gastroliths inside the animal are ground down and become smooth and rounded  

Now  sauropod fossils are commonly found with smooth stones  For years we thought these were gastroliths  They look just like gastroliths and were found in the area of the sauropods  stomachs  A recent study measured the gastroliths in modern animals  in ostriches  And the study showed that ostriches need to ingest about one percent of their total body weight in gastroliths  But we have been able to determine that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally  less than a tenth of one percent of their body weight  

So now we are not quite sure what these sauropods  stones were used for  It could be they were accidently ingested as the sauropods foraged for food  that they served no real purpose  Other researchers speculate that sauropods ingested these stones as a source of some the minerals they needed  such as calcium  

So the original hypothesis that the stones found with sauropods were gastroliths  even though it hasn t been supported  has helped us to make new hypotheses  which may eventually lead to the answer  

Lecture4 Studio Art  Primary Colors 

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a studio art class  

Professor

OK  As you probably know  primary colors are  theoretically speaking  the basic colors from which all other colors can be made  But as you ll find out when you start working on your painting projects  the three primary colors – red  blue  yellow – don t always make the best secondary colors  Combining red and blue  you will probably never get a fantastic violet  To get a nice violet  you ll have to add white  Combining yellow and blue  you will almost never get a satisfactory green  You are better off using a pure green pigment  

The idea of primary colors  and specifically the idea of red  yellow and blue being THE primary colors  didn t exist until about 200 years ago  Until then  the dominant theory about color was one that had been proposed by Isaac Newton  Newton gave a scientific and objective explanation of colors  He used a prism to break white light down into the various colors of the spectrum  And he theorized  rightly so  that different colors are essentially different wavelengths of light  But he made no mention of primary colors  That idea came from  or was at least published by a man named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  

Goethe was a well known author  He wrote many famous novels  plays  poems  So why did he start thinking about colors 

Well Goethe was part of the Romantic Movement in western literature  And he was a Romantic  through and through  meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual  emotional impact they had  as opposed to explaining them in terms of their scientific nature  He rejected an objective understanding of color  in favor of a more subjective understanding  He believed that when we see color  it stimulates our emotions  And different colors appeal to or inspire different emotions in different people  



Student

That sounds like psychology 

Professor

Well  color theory is used in psychology too  Some psychologists do use their field s version of color theory to diagnose and treat patients  Um… anyway  Goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to figure out which colors corresponded to which emotions  And in terms of that goal  he wasn t very successful  But his experiments actually did show a lot about the relationships between colors themselves  about how colors change when placed next to other colors  about how they interact with one another  Scientists studying optics and chromatics today still marvel at his findings  But Goethe wasn t really able to establish a clear connection between colors and emotions  

Then in 1806  he received a letter from a relatively unknown German artist  a painter named Philipp Otto Runge  In the letter  Runge outlined his own color theory  specifically the connections he made between colors and emotions  And his ideas about what colors symbolize  about the emotions that different colors inspire were based on the colors red  yellow and blue  Runge s choice of red  yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern day chromatics  it had to do with Runge s complex system of symbolism  his experience of nature  particularly with his experience of the quality of light at various times of the day  morning  noon and night  So each color had a specific symbolic value  

Well  four years later  Goethe published a book entitled Color Lesson  In Color Lesson  Goethe COINCIDENTLY cites the same colors as primary colors  At this point  Goethe was already a well known author  so he was easily able to popularize this idea of primary colors  and specifically the idea of red  yellow and blue as THE primary colors  


Student

But he didn t mention Runge 

Professor

Well  he did put Runge s letter in the book  at the end  But he added a disclaimer implying that Runge s letter didn t influence his work  Apparently  what Goethe was saying was that they just HAPPENED TO come up with the same theory at the same time

I am so sorry I am late  Professor Mills  I just finished at the student medical center  I twisted my ankle playing soccer this morning  It took longer than I expected to see the doctor  

Professor
That s okay  Don t worry about it  David  So let s get started  Your paper on John Dewey s political philosophy has a few issues I d like to cover  You gave a great biographical sketch in the beginning  Okay  

But then as you get into his political philosophy  I don t think you ve done enough to situate his philosophy within the time period  In other words  you haven t connected Dewey s philosophy to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time  

Student
So I haven t captured the most critical influences  the influences that were most significant to his political thinking 

Professor
Exactly  OK  Now  look back up at the section here  where you wrote about Dewey s view of individuality  This is all good content  But you haven t presented the information in a systematic way  I really think this portion on individuality needs to come later  after your paragraphs on Dewey s intellectual influences  

Student
After my revised paragraphs on what influenced them  

Professor
Yes  Revised  Let me ask  Uh  When you were finished writing  did you go back and ask yourself if all of the material was relevant 

Student
Well  no  

Professor
I do think there are areas that can be cut  I guess what I am saying is that your paragraphs aren t really presented in a logical order  The direction of your argument isn t crystal clear  And there s some unnecessary material getting in the way  

Student
OK  Sounds like I have a lot to do  

Professor
And one more thing  do you have a copy of the department s document on the correct format for index  citations and references 

Student
No  I mean  I look at it online when I was working on this assignment 

Professor
You really should print it out  You are going to need it for every paper you write in the political science department  It looks like you are getting it mix up with another referencing system  

Student
Oh  Yeah  I used something different in high school  It s so confusing switching to a new system  

Professor
I know  But remember  everything needs to be consistent when it comes to referencing  It is a very important academic convention 

Oh  also  I wanted to ask you… Will you be at the political science club meeting Saturday

Lecture1 Philosophy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a philosophy class 

Professor
Okay  So  uh  to continue our discussion… When philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge  they don t mean the source of information about any particular subject  They mean how we know what we know  

Let s start with one philosophical view foundationalism  

Foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims  what we think we know  that is  they need to have a base  And think of knowledge as a house  you need a solid foundation on which to build your house  And if you have a strong foundation  your house is more likely to be solid  Well  foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge  If you have a solid base for your knowledge claims  then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong  valid  true  

First  you need some good foundational knowledge claims  and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these  Now  as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational  well  that s where this gets particularly interesting  in fact it sort of depends on which philosopher you ask  Take John Locke for instance  

Locke s viewpoint essentially was that when humans are born  their minds are like blank slates  that is  we don t have any kind of knowledge when we are born  We get our knowledge from our senses  you know  taste  touch  smell  sight  hearing  So  when we look at the world  first as babies and then as we grow  that s where our knowledge comes from  Our senses  our experiences serve as the foundation for our knowledge  

Now  for a very different view  let s turn to another philosopher René Descartes  

Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations  He believed that our senses are not to be trusted  So he wanted to find a more solid foundation for knowledge  He began with what has come to be called methodological doubt  And when we say methodological doubt  well … Descartes believed that everything should be questioned  that is  approach it with doubt and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false  that one thing would serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims  

So unlike John Locke  Descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses  He points out that at some time or another  everyone has been deceived by their senses  We have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong illusions  perhaps  mirages  When driving in a car on a hot summer day  you may see what looks like shimmering water on the road  which  as science tells us  is really just a mirage  an illusion caused by the heating of the air  Our senses are wrong  they ve deceived us  And Descartes thinks that since our senses can deceive us  we ought not take for granted that what they tell us is really true  That s the first step in his methodological doubt  

From there he wonders  well  ok  I can doubt my senses  but can I doubt that I am sitting in this room  Can it seem that we are not really here  That we are somewhere else  He conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room  But then he says  well  couldn t I just be dreaming  He s had dreams that were so real that he thought he was awake when in fact he was actually asleep  And this is another good point  It s really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming  Yet another proof for Descartes that we can t always trust what our senses are apparently telling us  We could be dreaming  And there s really no good way to prove that we are not 

So the common sense picture of reality  that the world is really the way it looks to us  Descartes shows that we cannot just assume this to be true beyond all doubt  And he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming  But consider this  he says  while one is thinking or doubting  or doing any of those sorts of mental activities  one has to exist  right  To even think that I doubt that I exist  you have to exist  And so what Descartes has done is find at least one thing that he can be certain of  He says   I exist   And that s a start  And other knowledge he tells us can be based on that foundation 
 


Lecture2 Animal Behavior
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class 

Professor
As you know  researchers have long been interested in discovering exactly how intelligent animals are  Today we are going to talk about a particular cognitive ability some animals seem to have the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror 

Student
Oh  I ve heard about that  Chimpanzees have it 

Professor
Right  Chimpanzees and other primates  chimps  gorillas  orangutans  and of course  humans  But it s also been found in elephants and bottlenose dolphins  a bit of a surprise  It s very rare  Most animals don t have it  And it s called mirror self recognition  or MSR 

Student
Well  how does it work  I mean  how do researchers know if elephants or chimps recognize themselves  

Professor
Researchers give them a mirror mark test  In the mirror mark test  researchers put a mark on the animal where the animal is unable to see it or smell it or feel it  like on the side of their head  without looking in the mirror 

Now  typically  when animals first see themselves in the mirror  they think they are seeing another animal  Often they will look for this animal behind the mirror  They may even exhibit aggressive behavior  

But some animals  after this period of exploration  exhibit behaviors that show they know they are looking at themselves  For instance  elephants will touch the mark on their heads with their trunks  

Now  it s been assumed that primates and some other mammals stood alone at the top of the hierarchy of cognitive evolution  But recently  birds have been found to possess some of the same cognitive abilities  In particular  researchers have discovered these abilities in corvids  birds of the corvidae family  

Corvids include ravens  jays  crows and magpies among others  And what kinds of cognitive abilities are we talking about  Well  corvids and some mammals have the ability to plan for the future  to store food for instance  in places where they can find it later  It s been suggested in fact that jays  corvids known for stealing each other s food  may hide their food precisely because they are projecting their own tendency to steal onto other jays  

So let s talk about a study recently conducted with magpies  As I said  magpies are corvids  And because corvids have these other cognitive skills  researchers wanted to see if they were also capable of mirror self recognition  So they gave them the mirror mark test  placing yellow sticker on the birds  black throat feathers  At first  the magpies all engage in the same social behaviors that other animals do looking behind the mirror  etc  But eventually  some of the birds  while looking in the mirror  kept scratching at the mark until they got rid of it  And they didn t scratch at it when there was no mirror around  So they passed the test  

Student
Wow  Do any other birds have this ability 

Professor
Well  not that we know of  There was a study using pigeons  where researchers attempted to reduce MSR to a matter of conditioning  that is  they claimed that the ability to recognize oneself in a mirror could be learned  So these researchers basically trained some pigeons to pass the mirror mark test  

But two things are noteworthy here  One  no one s ever replicated the study  But more importantly  it misses the point  The issue isn t whether some behavior can be learned  It s whether a species has developed this ability spontaneously  

Student
So what does the test tell us about corvids or chimpanzees 

Professor
Good question  For one thing  it is important because it sets animals with a sense of self apart from those without a sense of self  But more importantly  many researchers believe that MSR is indicative of other advanced cognitive abilities  Self awareness  even in its earliest stages  might entail an awareness of others  the ability to see their perspective  to look at the world from another s point of view  This is crucial  because it implies a high level of cognitive development  It s perhaps the first stage toward the development of empathy  

Student
But birds  brains are so small compared to primates 

Professor
True  Though corvids do have unusually large brains for birds  But size isn t the whole story  It s thought that primates are so intelligent because of a certain part of their brains  which birds simply don t have  But there is an area in birds  brains that researchers believe governs similar cognitive functions  

So primates and birds  brains have evolved along different tracks  but ended up with similar abilities

Student
Hi  Sorry  I m late  Professor Blane  

Professor
No problem  Jim  So you ve got some questions about your senior thesis requirement 

Student
Yeah  I ve got a couple of problems actually  So  the first thing is  you normally write it during the first half of the academic year  Right  In your final year of studies  

Professor
Right  

Student
But I have my student teaching scheduled for that time  I want to teach high school English after graduation  So I really need to give that my full attention  And I just worry that I won t be able to if I am writing my senior thesis at the same time  I mean  it s supposed to be 35 to 40 pages  That s a serious commitment  

Professor
You are right  But it really isn t a problem  

Student
Really 

Professor
No  A lot of English majors get teacher certification  so we have students like you do their senior thesis after their student teaching  It works out well  because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper  So you ll just enroll in a thesis seminar for the second semester  

Student
Well  that s a big relief  But it brings us to my second problem  I d really focus my studies on old and middle English literature  I am even thinking about doing a graduate degree with a concentration in that after I taught for a while  So I was hoping to do my senior thesis on Chaucer  on The Canterbury Tales  because that would obviously be useful if I do go on  But …

Professor
Ah  But Professor Johnson …

Student
Exactly  Professor John is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in France during the second half of the year  So without him around  I am not sure how I could do a senior thesis on The Canterbury Tales  I mean  the focus of his teaching and research is unique around here  

Professor
Yes  I understand  It would be difficult to do your paper without professor Johnson around  Hmmm… would you allow me to try to sell you on an alternate plan 

Student
Well  you can try  But Chaucer is sort of my hero  if you know what I mean 

Professor
Well  I am teaching a course on the literature of the Renaissance in the first half of the year  It ll meet late in the day  so it won t interfere with your teaching  And I haven t offered it in quite a while now  so I doubt you ever studied that period on the college level  

Student
No  I haven t 

Professor
If you would be interested in taking the course  I d be happy to give you supplemental readings  and I d also be happy to be your advisor for your paper later on  

Student
Well  I never looked at that area before  but I have always had an interest in it  So that does have a certain appeal  


Professor
Well  if you do decide to go this route  I would make that decision soon and I would use this summer productively  After all  this is not going to be like taking an intro course  
Lecture3 Botany

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class 

Professor
OK  Last time we talked about photosynthesis  the process by which plants use light to convert carbon dioxide and water into food  Today I want to talk about another way light affects plants  I am sure you all know from physics class about how light moves in microscopic ways and that we can only see light when the wavelength of that light is in a specific range  Plus  depending on the wavelengths  we see different colors  

Well  plants are also capable of distinguishing between different wavelengths of light  Now  I don t want to confuse you  It is not like plants have eyes  Plants don t see in the sense that humans or animals do  but they do have photoreceptors  

Photoreceptors are cells that respond to light by sending out a chemical signal  And the organism  the plant  reacts to this signal  In fact  the signals that plants get from their photoreceptors sometimes cause significant reactions  

And many plants are seasonal  And one way they know when winter is ending and spring is beginning is by sensing the change in light  The time when an adult plant flowers is based on the amount of light the plant senses  Certain plant species won t flower if they sense too much light and some plants will only flower if they sense a specific amount of light  Of course  these aren t conscious reactions  These plants just automatically respond to light in certain ways  

Plants are also able to distinguish between specific wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot even see  Specifically there s a wavelength called far red  Although why they call it far red … I mean  it is not red at all  It lies in the infrared range of the spectrum  We can t see it  but plants can sense it as a different wavelength  

OK  Now I need to mention another thing about photosynthesis  I didn t explain how different wavelengths of light affect photosynthesis  When a plant absorbs light for performing photosynthesis  it only absorbs some wavelengths of light and reflects others  Plants absorb most of the red light that hits them  but plants only absorb some of the far red light that hits them  They reflect the rest  Remember this  because it s going to be relevant in an experiment I want to discuss  

This fascinating experiment showed that plants not only detect and react to specific wavelengths of light  plants can also detect and react to changes in the ratio of one wavelength to another  This experiment was called the Pampas experiment  

The idea behind the Pampas experiment had to do with the response of plants to changes in the ratio of red light to far red light that the plants sense with their photoreceptors  Some biologists hypothesize that a plant will stop growing if it s in the shade of another plant  a reaction that s triggered when it senses an unusual ratio of red light to far red light  OK  

Imagine there are two plants  One below the other  The plant on top would absorb most of the red light for photosynthesis  but reflect most of the far red light  That would lead to the plant in its shade sensing an unusual ratio  There will be less red light and more far red light than normal  

What that ratio signifies is important  A ratio of less red and to more far red light would cause a reaction from the plant  It would stop growing taller  because that plant would sense that it wasn t going to get enough sunlight to provide the energy to grow large  

To test their hypothesis  researchers took some electrical lights  um… actually  they were light emitting diodes  or LEDs  These light emitting diodes could simulate red light  So they put these LEDs around some plants that were in the shade  The LEDs produce light that the plants sensed as red  But  unlike sunlight  the light from these LEDs did not support photosynthesis  So the plants sensed the proper ratio of red light to far red light and reacted by continuing to grow taller  while in reality these plants were not getting enough energy from photosynthesis to support all of that growth  And because they weren t getting enough energy to support their growth  most of the shaded plants died after a short time  


Lecture4 Archaeology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class  

Professor
It s every archaeologist s dream to find a lost civilization  to make some huge discovery  to find artifacts no one else has laid a hand on in millennia  You might think that this never happens any more  given all the research in archaeology that s been done  But in the late twentieth century  archaeologists discovered the remains of a sophisticated people whose settlement might have been the hub of a civilization few people even thought existed  

They found this site at the edge of a desert in Turkmenistan  in central Asia  where a series of mounds rise up from the plains  Now  you might remember because we ve talked about this  archaeologists know that mounds such as these are the kinds of geological features that indicate the presence of ancient settlements  Jim 

Student
Um…mounds can be different things  right  Some are burial places…

Professor
Exactly  And some are the remains of cities  The inhabitants would build houses and temples you know  what have you  And over time  those buildings would fall down or be torn down and then be built over  Over time  generations of building and rebuilding in the same area would result in a large hill the size of a city  Careful excavation and documentation of layers in a mound can reveal a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people in a settlement over many periods of occupation  

Now  this particular site is called Gonur depe  What was found at Gonur depe was amazing  the ruins of a huge palace complex  the foundations of shops and houses  the remains of thick walls and towers that fortified the city  There was even an elaborate canal system and a lot of very intricate jewelry  All these findings seem to indicate that they are the remains of an ancient civilization that was every bit as advanced as other more famous civilizations of the time  Like those in Egypt  or  or China  And the site dates back to 3 000 B C E 

Student
Did they trade with those other civilizations  Because if they did  wouldn t there ve been some evidence of that  You know  an artifact found in the ruins of other civilizations  

Professor
That s a good question  I mentioned Jewelry  well  Jewelry have been found in Mesopotamia and at archaeological sites in modern day Pakistan  But archaeologists didn t know where it came from  Only after the site at Gonur depe was excavated were archaeologists able to identify it as coming from Gonur depe  Uh  Sheryl 

Student
I wonder why nobody found this site before  

Professor
Well  before the discovery of this site  it was commonly believed that central Asia had always been occupied by mostly nomadic people  So there would be no record of major settlements  A couple of small finds have been made in the area  but really  no one had looked very hard  

Now  one mystery regarding this site is that archaeological records show it was inhabited for only a few centuries  

Student
What happened to the people who lived there  

Professor
Well  the site was close to the Murgab river  which they would have depended on for their water  And the Murgab river  which runs toward the west  is the kind of river that shifts its course over time  So one theory is that the river s course shifted toward the South  and they simply followed it and built new towns to the South  

Another theory is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements  But we might never know the truth  

One thing we do know is that in the decades since Gonur depe was discovered  the site has deteriorated significantly  I mean  it s been disturbed for the first time in millennia  And being exposed to the Sun and wind has taken its toll on the ancient city  

So now the question is  do we partially restore and rebuild the site before the entire thing disintegrates  It will take a lot of funding to restore it and I am not sure it ll be made available  which would be a pity  Even a partly altered site can provide valuable information  which would be lost otherwise

Well  I am kind of confused about my schedule  I printed it out this morning  But one of the classes I registered for is missing  

Employee
OK  Let s see if we can figure this out  What s your name 

Student
Lisa Johnson  

Employee
Alright  I am bringing up your schedule on the computer  Hmmm…It looks like you re registered for Introduction to Astronomy  Survey of American Literature  and Introduction to Government and Politics  

Student
Well  yes  but I also registered for a language class Level One Japanese  Did they…I don t know  maybe cancel it  

Employee
I doubt it  The Japanese classes are quite popular  But let s take a look at the list of Japanese classes being offered this semester just to make sure  Um… what section did you register for  

Student
I don t remember the section number  But it s the one that meets at eleven  

Employee
Ah  That would be section five  Well  according to this  the class is completely full  Are you sure…you  um  you registered online  right 

Student
Yeah 

Employee
Did you get a confirmation message 

Student
What do you mean  

Employee
Well  once you ve successfully registered for a class  the computer gives you a message saying you are in  

Student
Oh  You mean that message at the bottom of the screen that says you re now registered for this class  Actually  I didn t get that message  I got one that said  instructor s signature required   I thought I just needed to get to professor s signature on the first day of class  

Employee
Well  you do  But the professor might no sign it  It depends on how full the class is and how many additional students the professor is willing to let in  

Student
So that means I am not registered for the class  Not unless the professor signs me in  What  uh  what should I do now  

Employee
Let me give you the form the professor needs to sign  Go to the class on the first day  get there early  so you can talk to the professor before class starts  Find out if he or she is willing to let you in  If so  bring the signed form back here and we ll register you for the class  

If not  well  you ll have to find a different class  I d start looking for alternatives now  just in case  

Student
What do you think my chances are of getting into this class 

Employee
Students often add and drop classes once the semester begins  so there is a real chance a seat would open up  But of course there are no guarantees  

Student
It s just that I need a language course to graduate and that s the only Japanese class that fits my schedule  

Employee
Yes  But according to our records  you are only in your first year here  If you can t take the class this semester  you still got time  

Student
I know  I was just hoping to take care of my requirements earlier rather than later 

Employee
I understand  I just wanted to make sure you know you had options  





Lecture1 Ecology Pedodiversity 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a plant ecology class  

Professor
So far we have covered biodiversity in the hard wood forest here in the upper peninsula of Michigan from a number of angles  We ve looked at everything from how biodiversity relates to species stability  to competition for forests resources and more  

But now I want to discuss what s called pedodiversity  Pedodiversity is basically soil diversity  When we analyze pedodiversity within an area  we are measuring how much variability there is in soil properties and how many different types of soil there are in a particular area  

So we look at soil chemistry  For example  how much nitrogen or magnesium there s in the soil in one spot  And we compare it with the chemistry of the soil a short distance away  

Until recently  there hasn t been a whole lot of attention paid to pedodiversity  But that s changing rapidly  More and more studies are being done in these fields  There s a link between biodiversity and pedodiversity  an obvious relationship between soils and flora and fauna  which is why pedodiversity really should be considered in forest management  

A high degree of soil variability in a small area is common  particularly within forests  If you compare soils from a forest with soils that don t come from a forest  the amount of variability will most likely be greater in the forest s soil  It generally has more diversity  

Um…OK  There are three main causes of pedodiversity within old growth forest here in our region of Michigan  

One is tree species  Different species have different influences on soil formation and soil properties  For example  pine trees drop pine needles  And those needles add a lot of acid to the soil  The organic litter of another tree species might add less acid but more of something else  A lot of different types of trees in an area might mean more pedodiversity  

Another cause  Gaps … created when trees fall  You see  where there are gaps  open areas in the forest  the soil there changes  Um… for instance  without a tree to absorb radiation from the Sun  to offer shade  the full intensity of that radiation reaches the ground  The soil where the tree used to be heats up  And without a tree to soak up moisture from the ground  the soil remains wetter than in the surrounding forest  With a higher temperature and more moist conditions  the process of organic matter decomposition speeds up  In other words  organic matter gets broken down and added into the soil more quickly in these gaps than in the surrounding forest  

OK  And the third cause trees being uprooted  When a tree is uprooted  it might fall into some other trees on its way down  thus falling only partway over  Or it might crash all the way down to the forest floor  Either way  if its roots are pulled up from out of the ground as the tree topples over  then there s usually a big hole  a pit left in the ground where the roots used to be  And there s still a lot of soil attached to the roots  clinging to the roots  As that soil is eventually shed from the roots by rain and wind and the movement of squirrels climbing around  things like that  Um    as the soil is shed  it drops down and forms a little hill of dirt  a mound  

Pits and mounds have significantly different soil properties than other areas in the forest  You get a redistribution and mixing of soil as deep roots are ripped up from the ground  Rock fragments can be pulled up too  if they ve gotten entangled with the roots over the years  So rock fragments from the subsoil can end up concentrated on the surface  

There are forests management implications I want to point out  Forests management impacts soil quality  And when we better understand pedodiversity  we will be better able to predict the impact of forest management on soil  But in general  for positive impact  forest management practices should mimic natural forest processes  And the goal should be to promote pedodiversity  and through this  biodiversity in general  

I have a handout  an article on pedodiversity in a section of forests near here  I want you to read it  because it makes a point that I ve only touched on  From what I have been saying about the causes of pedodiversity  you might assume that the relationship between forest dynamics  what happens to the trees  and pedodiversity is a one way street  As the article explains  forest dynamics affects pedodiversity  But pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics  It s worth bearing in mind  




Lecture2 Architecture Reverberation 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an architecture class  

Professor
Today I d like to talk a bit about the relationship between the built world and sound  Uh  the design of buildings like concert halls or theaters  So  what s the most important aspect in the design of such a building 

Student
Acoustics 

Professor
Yes  Now  people have been concerned about how sound carries in auditoriums and theaters for at least 2 000 years  But it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that architectural acoustics became a scientific field  That was when the physicist Wallace Sabine started to do extensive studies on reverberation  

Sabine wanted to find out why the audience could not understand speakers at a lecture hall in Boston  He designed a series of studies on reverberation to figure it out  So  what is reverberation  It s the persistence of sound in a room after the source has stopped making sound  You see  sound made in a room reflects off the walls  floors and ceiling  That s the reverberant sound  The time it takes for the reverberant sound to die down is important for the acoustic quality of a room  Sabine recognized this and he came up with an equation to measure a room s reverberation time  

So  what happens if the reverberation time is very long  

Student
Wouldn t it be difficult to hear new sounds if you can still hear the old sounds  

Professor
Exactly  A long reverberation time may cause musical notes to drown one another out  

On the other hand  if the reverberation time is very short … meaning  the reverberations are absorbed very quickly  the room is called dead  Performers would feel they have to struggle to fill the room with sound  We don t want that  In a concert hall or theater  we prefer a live room  where the sound has fullness  

So we need to control the reverberation time  After all  we don t want the listeners or the performers have to struggle  right  

So what are some important considerations when we design a theater or a concert hall 

Student
The size of the place  

Professor
Absolutely  The larger the room  the longer the reverberation time  So we ll have to take into account what the room will be mainly used for  since music requires more reverberation than speech  A room intended for music needs to be designed differently from a room intended for drama  For music  we need a very large room  a concert hall  actually I should say for full orchestras  Because for a single instrument  say something like a piano recital  a room with a short reverberation time is better  So for a solo piano a smaller room works well  Yes 

Student
I read that concert halls designed for symphony orchestras have too much echo for jazz music  

Professor
That doesn t surprise me  Most small jazz groups would need rooms with a shorter reverberation time  

But besides the size of the room  another variable affecting reverberation is the shape of the room  Let s say you design a rectangular box like space with bare walls and ceiling  this would allow the sound to act like a ball in a racquetball court  you know  bouncing around and hitting some parts of the walls and ceiling but missing many others  If that happens in a concert hall  audience members may hear some sounds  but not others  

So what can be done to distribute the sound evenly in every direction  The answer is  avoid straight  parallel walls  
Karen 

Student
But I think I ve seen photos of rectangular concert halls 

Professor
Right  Older concert halls from the 1800s are generally rectangular  But they all have a lot of decorations on the walls inside  lots of ornamental plasterwork like statues  which distribute sound very efficiently  reflecting it in all different directions  

And that brings me to another variable we need to consider  The acoustic characteristics of the building materials as well as the wall and floor coverings  In fact  most objects you see in a concert hall or theater serve double duty  The plush chairs absorb sound and soften reverberation  And the beautiful crystal Chandeliers  They are very good at diffusing sound  You see  everything must be planned down to the last detail in order to predict the acoustic performance of a room  

That being said  there s something that can t be controlled by the architect  The audience has an effect on acoustics too  The heads of people are good diffusers of sound  And Architects try to account for this effect in their design  but they can t guarantee a full auditorium

Listen to a conversation between a student and his music history professor 

Student
Um  professor Jenkins  The listening journal you assigned us to keep for the Intro to World Music class  well  I am not sure I understand what to do  I listened to the pieces you assigned this week more than once  but when I tried to write about them  I didn t know what to say  

Professor
Well  it s not easy to write about music  even for people who are supposedly expert at it  

Student
That makes me feel a little better  But I am just not familiar with how you keep a listening journal  I ve kept journals for other classes  summarizing and writing about how I felt about readings 

Professor
Well  a listening journal isn t all that different  I want you to note your feelings about musical compositions too  

Student
OK  There were pieces I like more than others  but I think you want our comments to be a little more…I don t know  analytical  Right  

Professor
Well  whether you like a piece or not is important  but you should be able to explain why you like a particular piece and be able to talk about its historical and musical context  Actually  the listening journal is a tool to help you listen to music actively  to think about what you are hearing  

Student
Maybe I am finding it difficult because I am not real familiar with most of the music you assigned  I mean  if it s hip hop or something I listen to with my friends…

Professor
Yes  because hip hop is a form that s familiar and meaningful to you  But you ll see as the semester progresses and you start learning more about musical forms  you ll become a more adept listener  And you ll start noticing patterns  

Student
OK  So the songs we listened to this week  the …the Canto  

Professor
The Cante jondo  You remember we said it means  deep song  in Andalusian Spanish  Not only because it s sung in a deep register  but also because it s a song about deeper or serious matters  certainly not lighthearted  

Student
Really  Hmm…I guess I didn t catch the double meaning  That s kind of cool  But anyway  even with the translations you gave us for the lyrics and everything  I don t know  I could tell it s sad  but I wasn t trying to analyze it  from a musical perspective that is  

Professor
OK  So this is what you should do  Go back and listen to the song selection and this time pay attention to the melody  to repetition  to the …

Student
There was plenty of that  Some parts sounded like the same note played over and over again  

Professor
That s exactly the kind of observation you would record in a listening journal  So  melody repetition  rhythm  how the piece is structured  as well as your reasons for liking or disliking it  

You know what  I thought everyone was clear about this  but you ve just given me a great idea  I am going to draw up a list of questions everyone should keep in mind when they are writing their journals  Other students may be having the same problem you are having  Lecture3 Archaeology Clovis Culture 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class  

Professor
We will be looking at the original settlement of the Americas next  and I ll spend the next few classes talking about the Clovis people and the two big questions archaeologists have about them  

The two big questions are  when did the Clovis people arrive in the Americas  And of course  were they the first people in the Western hemisphere  And we ll get to that  But for today  let s try to get an idea about  well  a question that s not addressed as much as the others and that s – what was their culture like  And how do we figure that out 

Now  again  there s a great debate about when the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas  And I am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back  so let s use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11 000 years ago  The Clovis people were likely settling North America 11 000 years ago  And leave it at that for now  



Now  most of what we know about the Clovis people comes from one of their tools the Clovis point  When we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that s worked to a sharp point  in this case probably to be attached to a spear  The Clovis point may be the most analyzed artifact in archaeology  And the point used by Clovis people differs slightly from later points  in the way that the base of the stone is thinned  uh  it s thinner toward the base  the part that s attached to the spear  So when one is found  it s usually not confused with points made by later groups  

Clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites  which you might expect  But another fascinating place we find them is in Clovis caches  A cache is just something stored or hidden away  It s also the term for the place where it s hidden  

The Clovis caches are collections of tools  stone points and other tools made of stone or bone  often at various stages of manufacturing  some were left unfinished  The traditional explanation is that these were emergency supplies  uh  meant to be used at a later time  Since the Clovis people were highly mobile  it s plausible that they would set up spots along established travel routes where they keep a variety of items  Either so that they wouldn t have to carry everything with them or so they could save time once they arrived at a site by not having to make stuff from scratch  

But there s another theory about the caches based on the quality of some of the points we ve found  You see  the points in some caches differ from other points  from points at Clovis camp sites for example  For one thing  these cache points are quite large  up to twice as large as regular points  so big that you couldn t attach one to a spear say  and expect to throw the spear accurately over any distance  So what were they for 

Well  it was originally thought that they were unfinished  that someone was working away a point  then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later  The problem is  it s unlikely that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches  that would be a lot of stone to chip away  A toolmaker starts with a smaller piece  And actually  far from being unfinished  a lot of these points really show excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail  And not just with respect to the skill  but also with respect to the raw material  it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone  

So we have to ask could these points have served another purpose  Maybe be they weren t just tools  Look at it this way  When the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas  they had a lot to learn about their new environment  Over time  they would have begun to recognize some places as special  important for some reason  Maybe there was always water available there  Or the hunting was especially good  So maybe the cache was a way to mark the place as significant

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a structural engineering class 

Professor
Today let s begin to look at structural engineering in the Space Age  Uh  new problems…new possibilities mean we can think in new ways  find radically different approaches  So let s consider…uh  well  what would you say is the biggest obstacle today to putting structures  equipment  people …uh  anything really  into space  

Student
Well  the cost  right 

Professor
Exactly  I mean  just taking the space shuttle up and back one time is hugely expensive  Uh  why  

Student
I guess a lot of it is for fuel  right  To…to get the rocket going fast enough  

Professor
OK  Fast enough to…

Student
To escape Earth s gravity  

Professor
Good  So we are burning up an enormous amount of fuel at every launch just to get the rocket up to what s known as escape velocity  Now  escape velocity is around 11 kilometers a second  pretty fast  But do we really have to go this fast  

Student
Well  yeah  I mean  how else can you  um…escape  I mean  that s the whole point of escape velocity  right  Otherwise gravity will pull you back down to the Earth  

Professor
Actually  that s a common misconception  Escape velocity is simply the speed of an object that s …uh  let s say  shot out of a cannon the minimum initial speed so that the object could later escape Earth s gravity on its own  But that s just if there s no additional force being applied  If you keep on supplying force to the object  keep on pushing it upward  It could pull away from Earth s gravity at any speed  

Student
Even really slow  So you re saying …like  if you had a ladder tall enough  you could just climb into space 

Professor
Yeah  Uh  well  theoretically  I mean  I can see some practical problems with the ladder example  Uh  like you might get just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so  uh  especially with all the oxygen tanks you ll have to be hauling up with you  

No  I was thinking more along the lines of an elevator  

Student
Wait  You are serious 

Professor
Sure  An elevator  That s a new idea to most of us  but in fact it s been around for over a century  If we could power such an elevator with solar energy  we could simply rise up into space for a fraction of the cost of a trip by rocket or shuttle  

Student
But wait  elevators don t just rise up  It have  sic  to hang on some kind of wire or track or something  

Professor
Uh  true  And for decades that s exactly what s prevented the idea from being feasible or even just taken seriously  Where do we find the material strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a cable or track  I mean  we are talking 36 000 kilometers here  And the strain on the cable would be more than most materials could bear  

But a new material developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond  yet it s much more flexible  I am talking about carbon nanotubes  

Student
OK  I ve read something about carbon nanotubes  They are strong  alright  but aren t they just very short little cylinders in shape  

Professor
Ah  yes  But these cylinders cling together at a molecular level  You pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes  and its neighbor s come with it  and their neighbors  and so on  So you could actually draw out a 36 000 kilometer strand or ribbon of nanotubes stronger than steel  but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair  

Student
OK  Fine  But what s going to hold this ribbon up and keep it reach enough to support an elevator car 

Professor
Well  we definitely have to anchor it at both ends  So what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the equator and a satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth  There s a reason I mentioned that figure of 36 000 kilometers  That s about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the equator to constantly remain directly above the exact same spot on the rotating planet Earth  So once you are in this geostationary orbit right over the tower  just lower your carbon nanotube cable down from the satellite  tether it to the tower here on Earth  And there you have it  

Student
So you really think this is a possibility  Like  how soon could it happen  

Professor
Well  the science fiction writer Arthur C  Clarke talked about building a space elevator back in the 1970s  And when someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality  his reply was   Probably about fifty years after everybody quits laughing

Student
This is the administrative office  right 

Employee
Uh huh  How can I help you 

Student
Well  I am stopping by to reserve a place for my school club that meet and work  pretty much on a regular basis  Ideally  our preference would be to have our own office 

Employee
Hmm…well  we are out of private offices  But we do have some semi private options still available  

Student
What do you mean 

Employee
Well  it s a setup where you ll have a larger workspace shared by two other clubs  In other words  each club would have its own work area within that one room  

Student
Oh  Are there any divider  walls or anything 

Employee
Oh  yes  There will be a couple of dividers  so there s some privacy  

Student
Um  We ll work with that then  I wouldn t want to be without an office  

Employee
OK  Here are the two forms you have to fill out  Why don t you do it now while I set that up through out computer system 

Student
OK 

Employee
So what s your club s name  And the last name of the club president 

Student
Oh  it s the photography club  And it s Williams  That s me  John Williams  

Employee
Hmm…that s not pulling up anything on my screen  Um…let me try something else  Uh  how about your faculty advisor s name  

Student
Sarah Baker  She is in the Arts Department  

Employee
Hmm…No  Strange  You know your club is just not showing up in my online records  Is this an established club 

Student
No  Actually it s a brand new one  

Employee
Hmm…have you completed the registration process 

Student
Yeah  last week  That was my very first step  

Employee
Right  Well  for my purposes  a club definitely has to be registered before I can proceed further  At the moment  however  it appears that there s no record of your club s registration  

Student
Really  I thought everything was finalized last week  

Employee
Well  it is surprising  Usually there s a 24 hour turnaround in our computer database  So then do you have the registration approval letter from the review committee  That would give me the verification I need  

Student
Yeah  I do  I mean  well  I don t have it with me  But … I… I  uh  can get it from my dorm room  bring it back with me and submit it with those forms you need from me  

Employee
Great  That ll work  And just so you are aware  there re lots of benefits to being registered  

Student
Oh  yeah  I think the university will give us permission to set up a website  right  I want to get students sharing their ideas on the website  you know  establish a photography blog 

Employee
Yes  You ll be able to do that  And…um…actually there s more  You ll be allowed the use of audiovisual equipment at no cost  You ll receive a club mailbox and a club email address  You ll be allowed to post your flyers and posters around the campus for publicity  And you could be eligible for funding for club events  

Student
Well  we are definitely interested in hiring a professional speaker at one of our campus events at some point in the semester  And speakers almost always charge a fee  So I ll definitely follow up on that 
Lecture1
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class 

Professor
We ve been talking about animal cognition the study of animal intelligence  Now  much of the research in this area is motivated by the search for animal analogues  or parallels to human cognitive processes  And one of the processes we ve been investigating is metacognition  

What is metacognition  Well  it s being aware of what one knows or feels  uh  um… having an awareness of one s state of mind  And making decisions about behavior based on what one knows  Researchers have long been interested in whether animals possess this capability  but…but couldn t test it because animals aren t able to report their feelings  

But recently one group of researchers found a way to solve this problem  They did studies with…with monkeys and dolphins that provide evidence that these animals have the ability to feel uncertainty  to feel unsure about something and…and…well  to know that they are uncertain  

So how could these researchers figure out if an animal feels uncertainty  Well  it began with a study one of them did on a dolphin  who had been trained to recognize a particular high pitched tone  The dolphin was taught to press one of two paddles depending on whether it heard the high tone or one that was lower  Food was a reward for a correct response  But if the wrong paddle was pressed  the dolphin had to wait several seconds before it could try again  The task varied in difficulty according to the pitch of the second tone  The closer it came in pitch to the first one  the hard it became for the dolphin to correctly identify it as low  And the researcher noted that the dolphin is quite eager to press the paddle when it was sure of the answer  but exhibited hesitation during difficult trials  

Next the researcher introduced a third option  a third paddle that would initiate a new trial  giving the dolphin the choice of passing on difficult trials  Once the dolphin figured out the result of pressing this new paddle  it did choose it frequently when the trial was difficult  The researcher took that as an indication that the animal wanted to pass because it didn t know the answer and knew it didn t know  

But there was a problem  Other researchers protested that the… the opt out response was simply a learned or conditioned response  You remember intro to psychology  right  In other words  by pressing the pass paddle  the dolphin avoided having to wait and hasten the possibility of a full reward by moving directly to the next trial  So the experiment didn t necessarily indicate that the dolphin had knowledge of its own uncertainty  just that it wanted to avoid negative consequences  

So more recently  our researcher and his colleagues devised a new study  this time using monkeys  In this experiment  the monkeys had to identify certain patterns displayed on a computer screen  These patterns were analogous to the tones used in the dolphin study  One type of pattern was of a specific density and was to be classified as dense  while the second type of pattern could vary in density  but was always less dense than the first one  And the monkeys  task was to identify this second type as sparse  So the denser the second type of pattern was  the more difficult the task became  

And as in a previous study  the monkeys were given a third choice that would allow them to pass on to a new trial  But unlike in the dolphin experiment  the monkeys had to complete four trials before they got any feedback  They didn t know if they responded correctly or incorrectly after each trial because there was no reward or punishment  At the end of four trials  feedback was given  The monkeys received a full reward for each correct response  And a time out during which a buzzer was sounded for each incorrect response  But the monkeys had no way to tell which reward or punishment was associated with which response  And they didn t get either reward or punishment for choosing the pass option  the…um…the uncertainty response  But nevertheless they still chose this option in the appropriate circumstances when the trial was particularly difficult  And this is evidence that it wasn t a conditioned response  because that response didn t guarantee a faster reward  

So what does all this tell us about animal consciousness or animals  awareness of themselves and their state of mind  Can we really know what s going on in the minds of animals  No  Of course not  But exploring the metacognitive capacity of animals could become an important criterion in highlighting the similarities and differences between human and animal minds  







Lecture2 Paleontology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a paleontology class  

Professor
As we ve discussed  birds are apparently descendants of dinosaurs and shared many commonalities with some dinosaur species  like…um…feathers and maybe even flight and of course egg laid  OK  

So  many paleontologists  myself included  have wondered about other similarities between dinosaurs and birds  Since adult dinosaur fossils have sometimes been discovered near or on top of nests  we ve been looking at the dinosaur parenting behavior  

Student
Parenting behavior  well  that sounds so gentle and caring  But dinosaurs were ferocious reptiles and reptiles don t take care of their young  do they 

Professor
Well  some reptiles incubate their eggs  crocodiles do  And as for popular attitudes towards dinosaurs…well  take the Oviraptor for instance  

In the 1920s  a paleontologist discovered the fossil remains of a small dinosaur near a nest containing eggs  He assumed the dinosaur was stealing the eggs  so he named it Oviraptor that means egg thief in Latin  which fueled the generally negative public image of such dinosaurs  

But by the 1990s  other experts had convincingly made the case that instead of robbing the nest  the Oviraptor was probably taking care of the eggs  You see  dinosaurs  closest living relatives – birds and crocodiles – display nesting behavior  And dinosaur fossils have been found in postures that we now believe to indicate brooding behavior  that is  sitting on the eggs until they hatch  

So we are curious about the type of care dinosaurs gave to their young  And we d like to figure out which dinosaur parent  the male or the female gave the care  

Student 
Shouldn t the behavior of crocodiles and birds give us some clues then  

Professor
Well  with crocodiles  it is the female who guards the nest  and with birds  it depends on the species  it can be the male or the female that takes care the eggs  or both  In over 90 percent of all bird species  both parents take care of the eggs and the young birds  

Student
But sometimes it s just the male  

Professor
Well  exclusive care by the male parent is much less common  but it does occur  Now  for animals other than birds  the care of young by both parents is pretty unusual in the animal kingdom  Males contribute to parental care in fewer than five percent of all mammalian species  It s even less frequent among reptiles  And exclusive care by the male is very rare  So researchers have wondered about the evolution of male parenting behavior in birds for quite some time  And now there s research showing that for some of the birds  dinosaur relatives  it s likely that the male parent was also in charge of taking care of the eggs  

Student
How did they figure that out 

Professor
Well  first they looked at clutch volume  that s the number of eggs in the nest of crocodiles  birds and three types of dinosaurs  including Oviraptors that are thought to be closely related to the dinosaur ancestors of birds  

So when researchers examined fossilized remains of nests  they found that the dinosaurs had larger clutch volumes  more eggs in the nests that is  than most of the crocodiles and birds that were studied  But  and this is important  their clutch volumes matched those of birds that have only male parental care  You see  bird species in which only the males take care of the nest tend to have the largest clutches of eggs  

Student
So what s the connection between bird and dinosaur behavior 

Professor
Well  researchers now believe  because of this study  that the male parenting behavior of these birds might have its origins in the behavior of dinosaurs  

Student
Based only on evidence of clutch volume size  the number of eggs  

Professor
No  there s more  They also examined the fossilized bones of those three types of dinosaurs that were found on or near nests to determine their sex  You see  adult female birds during egg production produce a layer of spongy bone tissue inside certain long bones  And so did female dinosaurs of the kinds that were investigated  This spongy tissue serves as a source of calcium for eggshell formation  But when the dinosaur fossils were examined  there were no spongy bone deposits  

Student
Meaning that those dinosaurs on the nests were probably adult males who wouldn t have needed calcium for making eggshells  

Professor
Exactly  And then there s this  birds like the kiwi  the ostrich and the emu  they share certain physical characteristics with these dinosaurs  And interestingly  they also show a consistent pattern of nest care by the male

Professor
How was the museum 

Student
Great  I hadn t been there for a few years  

Professor
Did you enjoy the Van Gogh painting 

Student
That s the thing  Looks like I have to change my topic  

Professor
Hmm… we are getting close to the deadline  You were writing about the theme of night in the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh  
It s a wonderful topic  

Student
I know  People don t usually think of Van Gogh as an artist of nocturnal themes  They think of brightness  sunshine  all that yellow and orange  

Professor
You are right of course about the intense light associated with his daytime paintings  But his night paintings don t exactly lack brightness  

Student
That s the paradox that I really like  the paradox of painting a nighttime scene using so much color and light  So I was planning to focus mostly on his painting Starry Night  

Professor
But 

Student
When I went to the museum to look at the actual painting  like you told me to  It wasn t there  

Professor
Really  Isn t it part of the permanent collection  

Student
Yes  But it s on loan right now to a museum in Europe  

Professor
Ah  I see  Well  I am strict about having students write about paintings they can observe firsthand  

Student
Well  I found another painting I could study instead 

Professor
OK 

Student
I read that there are two paintings called Starry Night  The first one was done by the French realist painter Millet  It may have been the inspiration for Van Gogh s painting  Millet s painting is located near my family s house in Connecticut  And I am going there this weekend and could study it then  I made sure it s not out on loan  

Professor
That definitely would work then  Van Gogh copied many of Millet s compositions  We know that he really admired Millet s work  And a lot of us think Van Gogh saw this particular painting by Millet in Paris in the late 1700s  

Student
Yeah  Although Millet was a realist painter  and Van Gogh a post impressionist  the two paintings still share lots of features  not just the name  The most striking shared feature has got to be the amazing light effects  I am excited to go see it  But one other thing …

Professor
Uh huh 

Student
I was thinking about getting a head start on my next assignment while I am at the gallery in Connecticut  the assignment on miniatures  They have a lot of miniature portraits of children as part of their permanent collection  

Professor
American miniatures 

Student
Yeah  So I figured I could also get started on that essay  study a few while I am there  I d focus on the meaning of the objects that some of the children are holding  some are holding flowers  one child has a rattle  another a toy violin…

Professor
That would be fine  Uh  those objects…we call them attributes  The attributes chosen to be included in a particular miniature was often meant to communicate parents  hopes and dreams for their child  So I think you ll learn a lot about how people viewed children at the time the miniature paintings were done 
Lecture3 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 

Professor
There s been a lot of talk recently about life on Mars  at the level of microorganisms anyway  mainly because of a few important discoveries and inventions  

For example  one major discovery was that at one point water was present on Mars  How do we know  Well  in 2004  an exploration robot discovered jarosite there  

Jarosite is a yellowish brown mineral with a crystalline structure that s also found on Earth  It contains iron  potassium and hydroxide  The interesting thing is that on Earth at least it needs highly acidic water to form  So we ve got water or had it at one point  And since most planetary scientists believe that water is essential to life  the presence of jarosite means that one prerequisite for life was once present on Mars  

But there s another thing about jarosite  One step in its formation on Earth involves microorganisms  they actually speed up the formation of jarosite dramatically  Now  theoretically it is possible for jarosite to form without the help of biological life forms  But we don t really know for sure if this happens  cause… well  because every corner of Earth has some form of biological life  

But jarosite on Earth incorporates all kinds of microorganisms into its crystalline structure  So it s possible that if the jarosite on Mars was also formed with the help of microorganisms  we might be able to detect remnants of them in the samples we find  And we have instruments now that will enable us to try to do this  For example  there s a new instrument called the micro fabricated organic analyzer  or M O A 

The organic analyzer is an amazing tool  It will be able to collect soil samples and analyze them right there on Mars  pure  untouched samples  It will let us eliminate the risk we would take of contaminating the samples if they were brought back to Earth  And what they ll look for specifically in the soil is amino acids  
Amino acids  as you may know  are the building blocks of proteins  In fact  there are twenty standard amino acids involved in making proteins and lots more that aren t  

And here s the important thing  Amino acids are what we call handed  They can exist in two forms  which are mirror images of each other like hands  Right and left hands have the same number of fingers in the same order plus one thumb  But right and left hands are not the same  they are mirror images  Well  like hands  amino acids can be right or left handed  And the twenty that make up the proteins on Earth are all left handed  

Now  one reason the M O A   the organic analyzer is so impressive is that it tests not just for the presence of amino acids but also for the handedness of amino acids  If amino acids are found  it would be especially interesting if they show a prevalence of one type of handedness  either left  like amino acids on Earth  or right  

See  other physical processes in space  processes that don t involve living organisms  can create amino acids  But the ones synthesized through abiotic processes  which is to say not involving microorganisms  occur in equal numbers of right  and left handed  

So  a prevalence of left handed amino acids would indicate they were biological in origin  which would be amazing  A prevalence of right handed ones…well  that would be really amazing   Because the organisms that created them would be unlike anything we have on Earth  which produce only left handed ones  

Lecture4 Music History
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class  The professor has been discussing music of the twentieth century 

Professor
And what instrument comes to mind when you think of rock  n  roll  

Student
The electric Guitar 

Professor
Exactly  I think it s fair to say that the sound of the electric guitar typifies the rock  n  roll genre  which became popular in the 1950s  But really the instrument we know today was the result of a continuing development that started for our practical purposes in the 1920s  

But long before that even  people were experimenting with ways to modify traditional acoustic guitars  The first guitars were wooden  This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products  Then came steel strings  And that led to the lap guitar  which is also called the steel guitar because the player slides a steel rod up and down the neck  And those are all acoustic guitars  OK  

But then eventually we have electric guitars  Over the years  many inventors and musicians contributed to the design of these instruments  And each design was intended to alter the sound in some way  at first at least with the electric guitar  to make it louder 

So let s get back to when the steel guitar was first introduced in the United States  It was right after the Spanish American war in the late 1890s  US sailors who were stationed in Hawaii then a US territory were very enamored with the music they heard there  Uh  Hawaiian music was based on the steel guitar I just described  Some sailors learned how to play the steel guitar and brought it home to the States  Before long  Hawaiian steel guitar music was all the rage in the mainland US  It actually had a strong influence on the development of several musical genres  rock  n  roll most notably  but also jazz and blues  

Anyway  by the 1920s  with the advent of the public dance movement  people were gathering in large groups to listen to steel guitar music  But they had trouble hearing it  especially in large public settings  As I mentioned  the instrument was played horizontally  on the lap  Since the strings faced upward  the sound was projected toward the ceiling rather than outward toward the audience  Something had to be done  because the music venues and the audience kept getting larger and larger  So what would you do 

Student
Find a way to amplify the sound 

Professor
Yes  And to do that  inventors started attaching electronic devices  electrical coils to the acoustic guitars  And the electronics worked  But attaching electronics didn t just affect how loudly you could play  It also changed the quality of the sound  These early electric guitars were hollow and these early amplifiers caused vibrations in the bodies of the instruments  So as the sound got louder  it became more distorted  fuzzy sounding  And what musicians at the time wanted was a pure  clean sound 

Student
So where does Les Paul fit in  Wasn t he the first to electrify acoustic guitars 

Professor
Uh…no  Electrified guitars already existed by the time Les Paul came into the picture around 1940  What Paul did was experiment with ways of removing the distortions and he succeeded  He designed a guitar with a solid body that relied solely on electronics  Paul s solid body eliminated the vibrations  and thus the distortions  

Student
Excuse me  But when I think of electric guitar music  I think of Jimi Hendrix 

Professor
Jimi Hendrix  one of my favorites  

Student
But Hendrix s style really was all about distortion  that s what s so great about his music  all those special effects  I think a lot of rock  n  roll fans prefer that to a pure sound  

Professor
Yeah  You are getting ahead of me here  But good  because the point I was going to make is that the sound of rock  n  roll changed over the years  And the designs and technology of electric guitars made those changes possible  

So whereas Les Paul s goal was to remove the distortion  later musicians wanted to produce it  And by the time Jimi Hendrix came around  Well  essentially  Hendrix reinvented the electric guitar  in the sense that he created amazing effects and vibrations that changed the sound of rock  n  roll completely  So eventually  people tried to improve on Les Paul s model  well  to modify it I should say

Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her United States History professor 
Professor 
So  Amanda  you ve asked a lot of questions about trade during the colonial period of the United States  Has our discussion clarified things for you 
Student
Well  yeah  but now  I think writing about trade for my paper isn t going to work  
Professor
Oh  so your questions about shipping routes were for your research paper 
Student
Yeah  But now  I see that I probably need to come up with a new paper topic  Actually  there was one other idea I had  I have been thinking about doing something about community planning in the early British settlements in Eastern North America 
Professor 
Oh  OK  I am curious  Why are you interested in doing something on community planning in colonial times 
Student
Well  I am much more into architecture  It s my major and I mean  planning out a town or city goes along with that  I mean  not that I don t like history…I am interested in history…really interested…But I think  you know  for a career  architecture is more for me 
Professor 
That s great  I ve gotten some very thought provoking papers from students whose interests go beyond history 
Student
OK  But for the paper you wanted us to try to include a comparison  right 
Professor 
Yes  Actually  that was really the purpose of the assignment  The way the United States developed or perhaps I should say the colonies  since the land that would become the Eastern United States…uh…there were British colonies there four hundred years ago  But anyway…uh… development in the colonies differed greatly depending on geography  I am looking for papers that have ideas about something that happened one way in the Northern colonies happened a different way in the Southern colonies  
Student
Is that true in terms of urban planning 
Professor 
Very true  Towns in the Northern colonies were centralized and compact  They provided a meeting point for exchanging goods  for participatory government  and for practicing religion  Houses would be built along the roads that led into town  And just outside the developed area  there would usually be an open area of some sort for grazing animals and also group activities  Actually  the model for planning a town in the Northern colonies was not unlike the model for the development of towns in medieval Europe  After all  the colonists had just come from Europe and the medieval period was just ended  
Student
Medieval Europe  But what about the South  If I remember correctly… In the South  at least initially  they didn t build towns so much as they built trading posts  
Professor 
That s right  Most of the settlers in the North wanted to start a whole new life  But most of the people who came from Europe to the South just wanted to make some money and then go back  It is not surprising that some of most common buildings were storage facilities and port facilities

Lecture1 Music  Ancient Greek Music & Plato 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music class 
 
Professor 
Today we are going to do something a little different  In the past few classes  we ve listened to traditional music from around the world and we ve talked about the characteristics of these music  what makes these styles distinctive  what kinds of instruments are used  And you ve talked about what sounds familiar to you and what sounds strange  And many of you found some of what we ve listened to very strange indeed  
Well  today I want to start talking about western music and I am going to start in ancient Greece  But  now here s the part that s different  We re not going to talk very much about the actual music  Instead  we are going to talk about what the Greeks believed about music 
Now  there are some very good reasons to approach the material in this way  First  well  we don t have very much ancient Greek music studied  Only about 45 pieces survived…uh…these are mostly records of poems and songs  And we are not sure how well we can reproduce the melodies or rhythms  because they were apparently improvised in many cases  So we really don t know all that much about what the music sounded like  
What we do know about   and this really is the most important reason I am approaching today s lecture the way I am   is the Greek philosophy about music and its continuing influence on western attitudes toward music  
Now  if we re going to understand the philosophy  we have to first understand that music for the Greeks was about much more than entertainment  Yes  there was music at festivals and we have sculptures and paintings showing people listening to music for many of the same reasons that we do  But this isn t the whole story 
The important thing about music was that it was governed by rules  mathematical rules  And for those of you who are also studying music theory  you ll see that it is in fact highly mathematical  
Um…and for the Greeks  the same mathematical principles that govern music also govern the universe as well as the human character  the essence of personality  People s characters were believed to be very sensitive to music  If you started playing around with the rules  you know  messing up the mathematical order  you could do serious harm  That s why music was considered so powerful  If you knew the rules  it could do great good  But if you broke them  you could do great harm to the character of the listener  
So  we have this Greek idea that music is directly related to human character and behavior  
The philosopher  Plato  talks about this in the context of education  For Plato  music is an important element in education  but only the right kind of music  That means the kind of music that builds the kind of character a good citizen or a future leader would need  Yes  For Plato  there is a kind of music that instills the qualities of leadership  just as there is a kind of music that makes a person soft and weak  
Now  Plato has very specific  very conventional kinds of music in mind  He is not fond of innovation  There were musicians in Plato s day who were experimenting with different melodies and rhythms  A definite no no for Plato  He thinks that breaking with tradition leads to all sorts of social problems  serious problems  even the breakdown of the fabric of society  I am thinking back now to when I first started listening to rock  n  roll and I remember my father saying it was a bad influence on us  I think he would have gotten along well with Plato  
Anyway  I don t need to tell you what I think about Plato s ideas about innovation  do I  Though I have to say it s interesting that the same arguments against new music and art are still being made  Perhaps like the Greeks  we recognize  and maybe even fear the power of music

Lecture2 Geology  Movement of Tectonic Plates 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class  
 
Professor
As we ve discussed  Earth s crust is made up of large plates that rest on a mantle of molten rock  These plates…uh…now these tectonic plates support the continents and oceans  Over time  the tectonic plates move and shift  which moves the continents and the ocean floors too  Once it was understood how these plates move  it was possible to determine past movements of Earth s continents and how these slow movements have reshaped Earth s features at different times  
OK  Well   as studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past  it can conceivably tell us about their location in the future too  right  So  in recent years  some geologists have used plate tectonic theory to make what they call geo predictions  Geo predictions are guesses about what Earth s surface might look like millions of years from now  
So  we know how certain continents are currently moving  For example  the continents of Africa has been creeping north toward Europe  And Australia has been making its way north too  toward Asia  
Does anyone know what s happening to the Americas  I…I think we ve talked about that before  Lisa  
Student
They are moving westward  away from Europe and Africa  Right 
Professor
Right  And what makes us think that  
Student
The Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading and getting wider  so there is more ocean between the Americas and Europe and Africa  
Professor
OK  And why is it spreading 
Student
Well  the seafloor is spilt  There is a ridge  a mountain range that runs north and south there  And the rock material flows up from Earth s interior here  at the split  which forces the two sides of the ocean floor to spread apart  to make room for the new rock material  
Professor
Good  And that means  over the short term…uh… and by short term I mean 50 million years  that s a blink of the eye in geological time  Um…over the short term  we can predict that the Americas will continue to move westward  farther away from Europe  while Africa and Australia will continue to move northward  
But what about over the long term  Say 250 million years or more  Well  over that length of time  forecasts become more uncertain  But lots of geologists predict that eventually all the continents  including Antarctica  will merge and become one giant land mass  a super continent  one researchers callingPangaea Ultima  which more or less means the last super continent  The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird 
Now  how that might happen is open to some debate  Some geologists believe that the Americas will continue to move westward and eventually merge with East Asia  This hypothesis is based on the direction the Americas are moving in now  But others hypothesize that a new super continent will form in a different way  They think that a new subduction zone will might occur at the western edge of the Atlantic Ocean  
Paul  can you remind us what a subduction zone is  
Student
Yeah  Um…basically  a subduction zone is where two tectonic plates collide  So if an ocean floor tectonic plate meets the edge of a continent and they push against each other  the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one  So the…um…the oceanic plate is made of denser and heavier rock  so it begins to sink down under the continental plate and into the mantle  
Professor
Right  So the ocean floor would kind of slide under the edge of the continent  And once the ocean plate begins to sink  it would be affected by another force – slab pull  Slab pull happens at the subduction zone  
So to continue our example… As the ocean floor plate begins to sink down into the mantle  it would drag or pull the entire plate along with it  So more and more of this plate  the ocean floor  would go down under the continent into the mantle  OK 
So  as I said  currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading  getting wider  but some researchers speculate that eventually a subduction zone will occur where the oceanic plate meets the continental plate of the Americas  If that happens  slab pull could draw the oceanic crust under the continent  actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the ocean floor to get smaller  That is  the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up  narrowing the distance between the eastern edge of the Americas and Europe and Africa  So they form a single super continent  ?

Conversation2  Credits for Internship 
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university center for off campus study 
Student
Hi  I am Tom Arnold  I am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research  I am doing an internship there this summer  
Employee
Yes  I have it right here  The mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago  
Student
Thanks  Um…I wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship  I don t know if…
Employee
I might be able to help you with that  Is there a problem 
Student
I just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected  The system should show that I am registered to earn four credits  But as of Friday  nothing was showing up yet  I was told it would be fixed this morning  
Employee
Well  I can check on the computer for you  Tom Arnold  right 
Student
Yes  
Employee
Well  it is showing credits…but only three  
Student
Really   So now what  These all have to be finalized last week  
Employee
Well  yes  The course enrollment period ended last week  But since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for you before then… Let me see what I can do 
Uh…did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship  Because the other students at the center for marine research are only getting three 
Student
Um…I am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center s aquarium  taking classes in marine biology and then teaching visitors about the various displays  I am doing a special research internship with the center  We ll be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean 
Employee
Oh  That sounds quite advanced 
Student
Well  the internship requires me to have scuba diving certification and to be a senior oceanography student  I want to do advanced study in oceanography when I graduate  So I really want to get a sense of what real research is like  
Employee
I see  Now let s try and see if we can… Oh  OK  I see the problem  There are two kinds of internships listed here regular and research  Yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits  
Student
Can you switch it  
Employee
Not yet  But it lists Professor Leonard as…
Student
She is in charge of all the internships  
Employee
She just needs to send an email so I have an official record  Then I can switch it  And that should solve everything  
Student
Great  And I know Professor Leonard is in her office this afternoon  so I can go there later  It will be such a relief to get all these paperwork completed

Lecture3 Marine Biology  Coral Reefs & CoT starfish 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Marine Biology class 
 
Professor
We ve been talking about the decline of coral reefs in tropical areas all over the world…um… how natural and man made stresses are causing them to degrade  and in some cases  to die 
So now let s focus on a specific example of a natural predator that can cause a lot of damage to coral reefs the Crown of Thorns  or CoT starfish  The Cot starfish is found on coral reefs in the tropical Pacific Ocean and it eats coral  Now  in small numbers  the starfish don t affect coral reefs dramatically  But periodically  starfish population explodes  And when that happens  the reefs can become badly damaged or even destroyed  something we are trying very hard to prevent  For example  during the 1960s  there was an outbreak of CoT starfish in the Great Barrier Reef  off the east coast of Australia  Luckily  the CoT starfish population gradually declined on its own and the reefs recovered  
But we were left wondering – what cause the population to increase so suddenly  Well  over the years  we ve come up with a few hypotheses  All still hotly debated  
One hypothesis is that it s a natural phenomenon  that the starfish naturally undergo population fluctuations following particularly good spawning years  
There are also several hypotheses that suggest some sort of human activities are partly responsible  like fishing  There are fish and snails that eat starfish  particularly the giant triton snail  which is the main predator of the starfish  These fish and snails have themselves experienced a decline in population because of overfishing by humans  So with a decline in starfish predators  the starfish population can increase  
Another hypothesized human related cause is fertilizer runoff  People use fertilizer for their crops and plants and a lot of it eventually makes its way from land into the seas  It s fertilizer  so it has a lot of nutrients  These nutrients have an effect on the starfish  because they cause an increase in the growth of phytoplankton  Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that grow in the ocean  Larval CoT starfish eat phytoplankton in their first month of life  so more fertilizer in the ocean means more phytoplankton  which means more starfish  bad for the reefs  
Now  the final hypothesis has to do with storm events  If some reefs are destroyed by storms  starfish populations that inhabited those reefs would have to condense and concentrate on the reefs that are left  So this can cause a kind of mass feeding frenzy  
So we have ideas  but no real answer  And because we aren t sure of the causes for starfish population increases  it s difficult to prevent them  I mean  some progress has been made  For example  new survey techniques have enabled us to detect population increases when the starfish are quite young  so we can be ready for them  But meaningful progress requires much better evidence about the cause 
On the bright side  in all the research being done on causes  we have discovered something related to how starfish populations might affect coral reef diversity  We think that when reefs are damaged  after a few years  the fastest growing corals repopulate the areas  And these fast growing species can grow over the slower growing species of coral  denying them light and preventing them from recovery  However  the faster growing species are the preferred food of the CoT starfish  So when an outbreak of CoT starfish occurs  they thin out the fast growing coral and may give the slower ones a chance to reestablish  So without the outbreak  the diversity of coral would be reduced

Lecture4 Anthropology  the Botai People & Horses 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class  
 
Professor
So now that we ve discussed how people in ancient societies tamed animals like cows and chickens for food and other uses  I d like to talk about an ancient culture that domesticated horses  It s the Botai people  
The Botai culture thrived over 5 000 years ago in central Asia  in what is now northern Kazakhstan  Pretty much all of what we know about the Botai comes from three archaeological sites  And we learned that the Botai were able to build large perennial villages  sometimes with hundreds of homes  We also found horse bones at these sites and these can be traced back to the time of the Botai settlements  The climate that the Botai culture lived in…it was harsh  And the Botai people…they didn t really seem to have much in the way of agriculture going on  So their whole economy was really based on horses  And because horses can withstand the tough climate  they can survive ice storms and they don t need heated barns  the Botai people could settle in one place and rely on the horses for food  clothing and transportation  
Student
So the Botai were the first to domesticate horses 
Professor
Well  we are pretty sure that horses were first domesticated a bit earlier  to the northwest  in the area that is now Ukraine and western Russia  It s quite possible that some of those people later migrated east to Kazakhstan 
Student
But what exactly tells us that these Botai people  that the horses in their area were really domesticated  
Professor
As with most ancient history  there is not much that we can be certain about  But we know there was a significant population of wild horses in that area  So there were plenty of opportunities for the Botai people to find horses to domesticate  We also know that horse milk was an important source of food for the Botai people  What  Milking a wild horse  Well  now  that would be impossible…to milk a wild horse  And then… there s the…
Oh  Yes  Eric 
Student
So you said last week that for some animals  like for dogs  there were physical changes taking place over the course of generations of dogs because of domestication  So can we tell from those horse bones if it was sort of the same for horses  
Professor
Actually  it wasn t  We know that horses have not changed a lot physically as a result of domestication  So those ancient horse bones don t tell us much about domestication  But…we ve found that…um…we ve found what maybe pens or corrals in the Botai settlements  And not too long ago  a new approach was used to find out if the Botai people were keeping horses  Soil samples from these pens or corrals show ten times the concentration of phosphorus 
Student
Um…phosphorus 
Professor
Yes  Phosphorus is a very significant indicator that horses  large numbers of horses were being kept in the settlements  You see  horse manure  horse waste is rich in phosphorus and also nitrogen compared to normal soil  But nitrogen is an unstable element  It can be washed out when it rains or it can be released to the atmosphere  whereas phosphorus combines with calcium and iron  and can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years  
The soil from the Botai settlement sites was found to have high concentrations of phosphorus and low nitrogen concentrations  which is important since it suggests that what we ve got is really old  not something added to the soil more recently  
Student
Wait  So if horses have been there recently  there d still be lots of nitrogen in the soil  
Professor
That s right  Yes  Karen 
Student
I just read an article  It said that one way to determine if there was an ancient fireplace at an archaeological site was to check the soil for phosphorus  So couldn t the phosphorus at the Botai sites just be from the frequent use of fireplaces  
Professor
You are absolutely right  However  when a fireplace leaves behind a lot of phosphorus in the soil  we d also find an unusually high concentration of potassium  But the soil at the Botai settlements  it was found with relatively little potassium  which makes it far more likely that the phosphorus came from horses  OK 
Now  later on  people of the same region  northern Kazakhstan  started raising sheep and cattle  And that led to a more nomadic culture  Since sheep and cattle can t survive harsh climates  they needed to be taken south every winter  Moving around meant working harder but the trade off was far richer  fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep

Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a bookstore employee 
 
Employee
Hi  Can I help you 
Student
Yeah  I need to sell back a textbook  Are you the person I speak to about that 
Employee
I am  But we can t buy textbooks back just yet  because the bookstore s buyback period isn t until next Thursday 
Student
I thought it started this week 
Employee
It is only in the last week of the semester after classes are over 
Student
Oh  Well  can you tell me if this book will be on the buyback list 
Employee
I can look  But we are still putting the list together  Professors have to tell us what books they ll definitely need again next semester  and the deadline for them to let us know isn t for a couple of days  So the list I have here is not really complete  Um…what class was the book for 
Student
Intro to economics  with Professor Murphy  
Employee
Professor Murphy  OK  I checked earlier and I know she hasn t gotten back to us on that class yet  So we don t know if she ll use the same book next time  Usually if an updated edition of a textbook is available  professors will go for that one 
Student
Um…so if this book doesn t end up on the buyback list  what can I do  I spent over a hundred dollars for it  and I want to get something back 
Employee
Well  if a professor didn t assign it for a class here  we could buy back for a whole seller who would distribute it for sale at another university bookstore  
Student
OK 
Employee
Anyway…if Professor Murphy does put it on the list  it is important thatyou come in as early as possible next Thursday  There s only a limited number of books we would buy back  Once we get the number of books we need for next semester  we would stop buying them 
Student
OK  So how much money will I get for the book 
Employee
Well  if it s on the buyback list  we ll pay fifty percent of what the new price was  But that also depends on what condition the book is in  so it needs to be cleaned up as much as possible 
Student
Cleaned up 
Employee
Because used books show wear and tear  you know  water stains  scruffy covers  yellow highlighting…You really need to make sure there are no pencil marks on the book  The price you can get for a text depends on the shape it s in  
Student
You mean I have to erase all the pencil marks 
Employee
If you want the best price for it…
Student
And what if you decide the book is too beat up and don t buy it back 
Employee
That does happen  Hmm…well  one more thing you can try is to place an ad in the student newspaper to see if you can sell it directly to another student 

Lecture1 Archaeology  Bananas & African History 
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class 
 

Professor
One of the important aspects of the field of archaeology…one of the things that excites me about the field…is that seemingly insignificant things can suddenly change the way we think about a culture We are always making new discoveries that have the potential to challenge widely held beliefs  

Take something like the banana  for example  It turns out that this ordinary fruit may be forcing scientists to rewrite major parts of African history  We know the bananas were introduced to Africa via Southeast Asia  And until recently  we thought we knew when they were introduced about 2 000 years ago  But discoveries in Uganda  that s in Eastern Africa  are throwing that into question  Scientists studying soil samples there discovered evidence of bananas in sediment that was 5 000 years old  
Now  let me explain that it s not easy to find traces of ancient bananas  The fruit is soft and doesn t have any hard seeds that might survive over the ages  So after 5 000 years  you might think there would be nothing left to study  Well  fortunately for archaeologists  all plants contain what are called phytoliths in their stems and leaves  Phytoliths are microscopic structures made of silica  and they do not decay  When plants die and rot away  they leave these phytoliths behind  Because different plants produce differently shaped phytoliths  scientists can identify the type of plant from ancient remains  
So  those scientists in Uganda  dug down to sediments that were 5 000 years old  And what do you think they found  Banana phytoliths  Obviously this meant that we had to rethink our previous notions about when bananas first arrived in Africa  But  well  this discovery had other implications for history  
As soon as bananas appear in the archaeological record  we know we have contact between Africa and Southeast Asia  It would appear now that this contact occurred much earlier than previously thought 
Al…although…now here s where the uncertainty comes in…we don t really have any solid evidence of trade between the peoples of these two regions that long ago  Presumably  if people were bringing bananas to Africa  they d also be bringing other things too  pottery  tools…all sorts of objects made for trade or daily use  But any such evidence is missing from the archaeological record  

The early appearance of bananas also suggests that agriculture began in this part of Africa earlier than scientists imagined You see  bananas  at least the edible kind  can t grow without human intervention  They have to be cultivated  People need to plant them and care for them  So if bananas were present in Uganda 5 000 years ago  we would have to assume…that…that…that someone planted them  
The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird
But  there are questions about this too  We know that bananas can be a staple food that can support large populations  as they did in Uganda in the more recent past  If bananas were grown thousands of years ago  why don t we see evidence of large populations thriving in the area earlier  

So  we are left with this mystery  We have what appears to be strong biological evidence that bananas were being cultivated in Uganda as early as 5 000 years ago  But we are missing other kinds of evidence that would conclusively prove that this is so  
Clearly  more research needs to be done  Perhaps by some new scholars from this university  At least give it some thought  



Lecture2 Biology  Populations in an Ecosystem 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
 
Student
Professor  since we are going to talk about changes in animal populations in the wild  I d like to ask about somethingI read in an article online  about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species  and how other environmental factors come into play too  
Professor
Right  Relationships between animal species in a given ecosystem can get pretty complex  Because in addition to predator prey relationships  there are other variables that affect population size 
Student
The article mentioned that populations of predators and their prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden  
Student
Oh  Yeah  I read about that in my ecology class  It happens in cycles  I think that s called a boom and bust cycle  Right 
Professor
OK  Well  hold on a second  First I want to go over some key concepts  Let s say there was a species that had access to plenty of food and ideal conditions  Under those circumstances  its population would increase exponentially  meaning it would increase at an ever accelerating pace  
Student
Wow  That sounds a little scary  
Professor
Well  it doesn t usually happen  Like you said  a rapid population growth is often followed by a sudden decline  But we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they are transplanted into a new environment  Um…because they face little competition and have favorable growing conditions  
But for most species  most of the time  resources are finite  There s only so much available…which leads me to my point  Every ecosystem has what we call a carrying capacity  The carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by the resources of a particular ecosystem  Resources are  of course  food  water  and just as important  space 
Although every species has a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase  assuming ideal conditions for the species in its environment  There are always going to be environmental factors that limit population growth  This is called environmental resistance  Environmental resistance is important becauseit stops populations from growing out of control  Factors such food supply  predation and disease affect population size  and can change from year to year or season to season  
Student
OK  I think I get it  
Professor
Well  let s look at a case study  That should make things clear  Some years ago  some of my colleagues conducted an experiment in an oak forest involving three different species  white footed mice  gypsy moths and oak trees The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928  
OK  Now let me explain what the situation is in this forest  Oak trees produce acorns  and acorns are a primary food source for white footed mice  Another food source for the white footed mice is the gypsy moth  So the size of the gypsy moth population is controlled by the white footed mice  which is a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillars are considered pests  They strip away the leaves from the oak trees every ten years or so  
Student
So the mice eat both acorns from the oak trees and gypsy moths  And the gypsy moth caterpillars eat oak tree leaves  
Professor
Right  Now  what makes this set of relationships particularly interesting is that oak trees only produce a large number of acorns every few years  
Student
So during the years with fewer acorns  the white footed mice have to deal with a smaller food supply  
Professor
Yes  But in the years with large amounts of acorns  the mice have more food  which leads to… 
Student
The white footed mice population growing 
Professor
And the gypsy moth population decreasing 
Student
How can we know that for sure  It seems like a big jump from more acorns to fewer gypsy moths  
Professor
Well  we can know for sure because in this oak forest  the researchers decided to test the links between acorns and the two animal species  In some parts of the forest  they had volunteers drop a large number of extra acorns on the forest floor  And in another section of the forest  they removed a number of white footed mice  In the forest areas where extra acorns had been dropped  the gypsy moth population soon went into a significant decline  But in the section of the forest where the white footed mice had been removed  the gypsy moth population exploded  









Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and an anthropology professor 
 
Professor
So how was the field trip to the Nature Center yesterday  You are in that biology class  aren t you 
Student
Yeah  I am  The trip was amazing  We took a hike through the woods and our guide pointed out all kinds of animal and plant species  She could identify every bird  every tree…I have to tell you  I was very impressed with her knowledge  
Professor
I am glad to hear you enjoyed the trip  
Student
Well  I am interested in getting an advanced degree in forestry after I graduate from here  So I love all this stuff And actually  yesterday s trip got me thinking about my research paper for your class 
Professor
Wonderful  Tell me more 
Student
So our guide was talking about how the human need for resources had shaped the environment  And I just assumed that the human impact on the environment was always destructive  
Professor
Ah…but that s not necessarily true  
Student
Yeah  That s what she was telling us  She said there s archaeological evidence that some prehistoric cultures relied heavily on dead wood for fuel  or…um…just cut off some of the branches of trees instead of killing the whole tree  
Professor
It is so funny you mentioned that  I was just reading an article about an archaeological site in Turkey where scientists found evidence that ancient people had been harvesting the branches from pistachio and almond trees The above text is a transcript of this conversation prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928   Of course  when you prune these trees  cutting off just the branches like that  you are actually encouraging more growth  And you end up with a bigger crop of nuts  So this was a pretty smart strategy for collecting wood  
Student
See  that s what I d like to write about  I want to look at ancient methods of wood harvesting that didn t result in the destruction of the whole forest  
Professor
Hmm…so you want to write your entire paper on wood harvesting 
Student
Is…is that a problem 
?

Professor
Well  it s certainly a timely topic  Researchers are investigating this now  Uh…it s just that…well…I am not sure how it fits with the assignment  Remember you are supposed to be focusing on a particular culture or region 
Student
Yeah  Um…actually I was planning on writing about the wood harvesting practices of the people who lived here  You know  the Native Americans who were living in this area and what that might tell us about how they lived  
Professor
OK  Well  that s a possibility  I just want to make sure you can find enough information on that topic to write a well developed paper  I d like you to get started on your research right away  Maybe even talk to that nature guide and show me what information you can find  Then we can talk about whether or not your topic will work  


Lecture3 Earth Science  the Copper Basin 
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class  The professor is discussing an area of the United States called the Copper Basin 
 
Professor
Now  you may not have heard of the Copper Basin  It s in the Eastern United States  in the Tennessee River Valley  It got its name because settlers discovered copper there in 1843  And soon afterwards  it supported one of the largest metal mining operations in America  At one time  four mining companies employed 2500 workers in the Copper Basin  For that time period  it was a huge operation  
Well  this mining operation turned the Copper Basin into a desert  In the 1840s  when mining operations started  it was a dense green forest  But in the 1940s  100 years later  it was as barren as the moon 
Efforts to reclaim the land and restore the basin to the fertile valley it once was…well  actually  those efforts are still ongoing  It s been a long and tedious process  In fact  it was many years before any results were seen  Copper mining had gone on there for more than 90 years  The damage couldn t be reversed overnight 
Although I should mention that by 1996  the water in one of the rivers flowing through the basin was clean enough that it was the site of the Olympic white water kayaking competition  And that river is still used now for recreation  
But…anyway…let s analyze the problem  It wasn t the mining itself that caused such massive destruction  It was what happened after the copper ore was extracted from the mines  It was a process called heap roasting  
Copper ore contains sulfur  And heap roasting was a way to burn away the sulfur in the copper  so they d be left with something closer to pure copper  Well  in the process  large vats of raw copper ore are burned slowly  for two or three months actually  to lower the sulfur content  And this burning  well…let s look at the results 
First  the mines were fairly remote  so there was no way to bring coal or other fuel to keep the fires going  So they cut down local trees for fuel  And like I said  the fires burned for months  Uh…that s a lot of fires and a lot of trees  Deforestation was occurring at a rapid rate  And it was accelerated by the smoke from the burning ore  Big clouds of sulfuric smoke  which was toxic to the trees  formed over the areas  Trees that hadn t been cut for fuel were killed by the fumes  
The sulfur also mixed with the air and created sulfur dioxide  And the sulfur dioxide settled in the clouds fell to the land in droplets of rain and sank into the soil  This is what we now call acid rain  You ve probably heard of it  But no one used the term back then  Anyway…the acid rain created highly acidic soil  Well  soon the soil became so acidic that nothing could grow  nothing at all  Vegetation and wild life disappeared  
And it wasn t just the land and the air  it was the water too  What do you think happen to the rivers  Well  there are no trees to absorb the rain  and there was a lot of rain  So the rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers  This is called silting  when soil particles are washed into the rivers  And the silting continued at an alarming rate  But this was toxic soil and toxic runoff  the acid and metals in the soil made the once clear rivers flow bright orange  
So it was really that one step in the process of producing copper…the problems just built up and up until there was a desert where a beautiful forest used to be  
OK  Now let s look at reforestation and land reclamation efforts  







Lecture4 Architectural History  Irwin & Hexagonal House 
Listen to part of a lecture in an architectural history class  

Professor
So last week we started our unit on residential architecture in the United States  So today we ll be surveying a number of architects who made contributions to residential architecture in the 19th century  
Now  it s worth noting that people who designed homes at that time probably had to deal with a certain amount of discouragement  Since there were other architects who thought it was more respectable to design the kind of buildings…and maybe other structures…that were less…less utilitarian in their function  In fact  an article from an 1876 issue of a journal called The American Architect and Building News stated that  and this is a quote  they stated that  the planning of houses isn t architecture at all  
So keep that journal article in mind as we look at the work of an architect named Harriet Morrison Irwin  Harriet Morrison Irwin was from the South  born in North Carolina in 1828  At the time  there weren t many architects from the southern United States   And as you might imagine  very few of them were women  So Irwin was really a pretty exceptional case  And she wasn t even formally trained as an architect  Her educational background was in literature  The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928  
Yes  Vicky 
Student
So she just had like…unnatural gift for architecture 
Professor
Yes  She was actually a writer for several years  But she did have a penchant for math and engineering  so she read a lot about it on her own  Um…especially the architectural essays written by the British critic – John Ruskin  And John Ruskin believed what 
?
Student
Um…that buildings should have a lot of access to the outdoors  to nature  Ruskin said that being close to nature was great for people s mental and physical health  
Professor
Right  So that was an influence 
Now  Harriet Irwin s contribution to architecture was relatively minor but still quite interesting and unique  She designed a house with a hexagonal shape  Josh 
Student
A house with six sides  Instead of the standard  you know  four sided home 
Professor
Yeah  The rooms inside the house were also hexagonal  six sided  So one important thing was that the rooms were arranged around a chimney in the center of the house  which could provide heat for the whole house through flues  uh  small air passageways into each room  as opposed to having a fireplace in every room  which would require more cleaning and make the air inside the house dirtier  
The house s shape also allowed for more windows  Each room had a large wall that could fit a couple of big winters  giving every room a nice view of the outdoors  
Student
Plus there would be good airflow through the house  
Professor
Yes  In warm weather when you can open all the windows  Good  

The doors to the house as well…uh…the house didn t have a main entrance or any hallways  So there could be a couple of entry doors in different places  which like the windows  provided ready access to the outdoors  
So  what other advantages might there be to hexagonal rooms 
 Pause…no response 
OK  Think about cleaning  What part of a room is usually the hardest to clean  Like…to sweep with a broom 
Student
Oh  The corners  Because in square or rectangular rooms  the corners are at 90 degree angles  It s hard to reach all the dust that gathers in the corners  But if Irwin s rooms were closer to a circle than a square  it would be easier to reach all the dust and dirt with a broom  Right  
Professor
Exactly 
Now  um…biographers who wrote about Irwin in the 19th century  I feel  sort of downplayed the ingenuity of her design  But I think if she had designed this house today  the same biographers would praise her for coming up with a floor plan that emphasized function  efficient function of a house  as well as a design that s creative and unique  
In any cases  three houses were built in Irwin s time that used her hexagonal design  And in 1869  when she was 41  Irwin became the first woman in the United States to receive a patent for an architectural design  And that speaks volumes  if you ask me

Student
Hi  I am a little lost  Um  is this the housing maintenance office  
Employee
You found it  How can I help you 
Student
Oh  good  I have a quick question  Are we allowed to keep electric heaters in our rooms 
Employee
Actually  you are not  What s going on  Your room cold 
Student
It s freezing in my room  I think the heat went out or something 
Employee
Are you sure it s out  Maybe it just got turned out too far 
Student
Oh  no  I tried adjusting the  uh  the heat control  but it doesn t make any difference  It s so cold in my bedroom I can t sleep at night  I ve actually been sleeping on the sofa in the front room  The heat still works in there  Actually  we get hot air in all the bedrooms except ours  
Employee
Wow  Do you have a roommate 
Student
Yeah  But she said she isn t bothered by the cold  But on the sofa  I am kept up by the noise out in the hall  The dorms can sometimes get pretty noisy  So what can be done about it 
Employee
Well  OK  There s a couple of things we can do  I can have a custodian take a look at it and see if he can do something  
Student
Actually  I asked the custodian yesterday to take a look  But he said he couldn t find anything wrong  He said that some of the other rooms have lost heat also and that if we d come here you guys would fix it 
Employee
Oh  he did  That s weird  because I would have…well  the custodians themselves are usually supposed to report any problems right away  OK  In that case  then what you need to do is…here  fill out this form  
Student
I have to fill out a form 
Employee
Yeah  but at least that ll put your heater problem in a work order for the maintenance crew and they ll get to you as soon as possible  Just so you know  because it s not winter yet and it s not as cold as it could be  it may take a few days for a maintenance crew to get to you 
Student
A few days  I can t even sleep in my own room  Can t we just get an electric heater 
?
Employee
I am sorry  But students just aren t allowed  OK  I can see that this is a problem  and not just with your room  So if you can get the form back to me this afternoon  I ll try to get a maintenance crew to look at your problem by tomorrow  How s that 
Student
Oh  that would be great  Seriously  I have to take off now  But when I fill this form out  I give it to you  right 
Employee
Right  And if I am not here  just put it in my box and I ll get it

Lecture1 – Archaeology  The Great Pyramid  
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class 

Professor
The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt might be the most famous building in the world  We know exactly when it was built  Construction started in 2547 B C E   about 4500 years ago  We know who had it built  That was the pharaoh Khufu  We know who oversaw its construction the pharaoh s brother  We know so many things about it  but the funny thing is  we still don t know exactly how it was built  
This picture will give you an idea of the size of the Pyramid and the size of the blocks it s made out of that  About two million stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid and they are incredibly massive  The average weight is two and a half tons  
The problem that has puzzled scholars for centuries is how were these blocks lifted up the height of this massive structure and then fit into place and without the benefit of modern technology  Of course  there ve been a lot of theories over the centuries  
The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus  He visited Egypt around 450 B C E   when the Pyramid was already 2000 years old  His theory was that cranes were used  much like we use cranes today to construct tall buildings  And Herodotus may have seen Egyptians using cranes made of wood  But the problem with this theory has to do with simple mechanics  A crane needs a wide and sturdy base to stand on or it will fall over  Well  as you get toward the top of the Pyramid  there s really no place for a crane to stand  The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a base  Well  so much for that theory  
The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to drag a stone block up the side of the structure  Of course the ramp can t be too steep  It has to have a long gentle slope  And that s the problem  If you build a ramp with a slight slope up to the top of a Pyramid that s over 130 meters high  it would have to be almost two kilometers long  Well  the Pyramid is built on a flat area called the Giza Plateau  The Plateau is simply not big enough to accommodate a two kilometer long ramp  
OK  So what now  Well  if you ve ever driven on a mountain road  you d know that it has a lot of twists and turns and bends in it  because that s how engineers keep the road from having to be too steep  So why not wrap the ramp around the Pyramid  Building the ramp around it as you go  Sounds like a pretty good idea  Except it s got a serious problem  See…one of the most remarkable things about the Great Pyramid is how accurate the proportions are  The dimensions are almost perfect  To get that perfection  the engineers must have had to measure it repeatedly during construction  And the way you d measure it is from the four corners of the base  Well  if you got a ramp spiraling up from the base of the Pyramid  those corners would be buried by that ramp during construction  
Well  who says the ramp has to be on the outside of the Pyramid  And now we get to the latest idea  If the ramp were on the inside of the Pyramid  the corners at the base would be exposed  so the engineers could do their measurements while they were building  
Well  an architect named Houdin has spent a few years working on making computer models of the building of the Pyramid  And what Houdin believes is that an exterior straight ramp was used to construct the bottom third of the Pyramid  this ramp would have been fairly short  It probably rose less than 50 meters  Then the rest of the Pyramid was constructed using an internal ramp that spiraled around the inside of the Pyramid  
But how can we test this idea  Well  there are several ways to look inside the Pyramid  
One is called microgravimetry  Microgravimetry is a technique that s used to detect voids inside a structure  You can then take the data and generate an image that shows any empty spaces in the interior  Well  in 1986  French scientists completed a microgravimetric survey of the Pyramid  And one of the images they produced showed an empty spiral shaped space inside it  The shape of that space corresponds exactly to what Houdin thought the ramp would look like  I think Herodotus would be convinced  We might very well be at the end of centuries of guessing

Lecture2 – Environmental Science  Water Management
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class

Professor
I d like to continue with the topic of managing water resources  but I want to focus on a particular case  Uh  um  an example of water management that s made us reconsider the methods we use when we make these decisions  So let s look at what s happening in the Colorado River basin
The Colorado River basin is a region in the Southwest United States  Seven states rely on the Colorado s water  And as you can imagine  as the populations of these states began to grow  it became clear that a system to distribute  uh  to make sure each state got its fair share of water…some kind of system had to be created  And in 1922  a water sharing agreement was made  Elizabeth  you have a question
Student
Well  how exactly do you figure out how to share a river  I mean  you can t…like cut it up into pieces
Professor
Well  let s start with the first step  And that s trying to figure out how much water on average flows through the river each year  Now  researchers had started gathering data on water flow back in the late 1890s using instruments they placed in the river  When the 1922 water sharing agreement was made  there were about twenty years of data on water flow available  The average annual flow was calculated  And  well  the agreement was based on that calculation  The same basic agreement is in effect today
Student
Wait  That was all the data they had  And they based their decision on that
?
Professor
Yes  And we ll why that was a bad decision in a moment  OK  As decades passed  it became clear that measuring river flow was much more complicated than we had thought  See…a river has periods of low flow and periods of high flow  And this wasn t taken into consideration when the 1922 agreement was made  In the 1970s  the population of the area was rising while the amount of water flowing through the river seemed to be falling  By this time  we had…what  A hundred years of recorded data to look at  That s still a pretty short time for an ancient river
To get more data  we looked at a different source a source that was able to tell us about hundreds of years of the river s history tree rings  OK  Let me explain
You probably know that we can determine a tree s age by counting the rings on a cross section of its trunk  Each ring represents one year of the tree s life  So if you know the year the tree was cut  you can count inwards and date each ring all the way back to the center  You can also tell how much moisture the tree got during each of those years by looking at the width of the rings  A wide ring means plenty of water while a narrow one indicates less
Fortunately for us  certain areas of the Colorado River basin are home to some very old trees  some 800 years old and older  Researchers can drill core samples  uh  basically get a cross section of a tree without having to kill it  look at the rings and get a picture of what the climate was like in the basin for each of the tree s years
Well  the results tell us something we wouldn t have known without this data  that over the past 500 years or so  the Colorado River basin has experienced severe droughts  some worse than any we ve ever recorded  They also showed that the early to mid 1900s  when most of the data that led to the water sharing agreement was collected…well  this was the wettest period in the past 400 years  Well  obviously  had water management officials known then what we know now  the 1922 agreement would have been handled differently
But today we can use the past to help prepare us for the future  With the demand for water in the basin stays increasing and with the real likelihood of lower flows in the river  if history is our teacher  we can develop innovative methods of water conservation and reevaluate how water is distributed  ?

Hi  Dennis  You are right on time  Come on in and have a seat 
Student
Great  Thanks  
Professor
So like I told you in class  I just wanted to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations for next week are all in order and coming along well  And as you know  you are supposed to report on some area of recent research in genetics  something…you know…original  
Student
Well  I think I found just the thing  It actually occurred to me a couple nights ago while I was eating dinner in the cafeteria  Tell me professor  do you like broccoli 
Professor
Broccoli  You mean the vegetable broccoli  
Student
Yeah  
?
Professor
Well  I guess not really 
Student
Me neither  I have never liked it or most other vegetables for that matter…Brussels sprouts  asparagus  cauliflower…you name it  They just taste bitter and…well…nasty to me  My mother always called me a picky eater  
Professor
OK…And 
Student
And so I got to wondering  I mean  I am obviously not the only person like this  So is this just because of some…like trauma from our childhoods  Some bad experience we ve had with some vegetables  Or could there be some genetic explanation for why some people are picky eaters and others aren t 
Professor
OK  I see  Well  I suppose it s a possibility  
Student
Actually  it turns out it s more than a possibility  I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently  
Professor
Well  I guess that s not too surprising  And this is great stuff actually  So what s the verdict 
Student
Well  this guy seems to have discovered a particular gene that actually makes it possible for people to taste the bitterness in certain green vegetables  But people who have a mutation in that gene cannot taste the bitterness  
Professor
Well…that s certainly fascinating  But…so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some sort of sensory deficit  Sort of makes us picky eaters than normal ones  doesn t it  I mean  that s kind of turning things on their head  isn t it 
Student
Well…then again  it wouldn t be the first time  would it  Think of it this way  humans originally needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be poisonous  But at some point  as people figured out what they could safely eat  this need became less crucial and a segment of the population lost that ability  
Professor
OK  Well  you make a compelling case  I can t wait to hear more about this when you deliver your report

Lecture3 – Biology  Notothenioids 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 

Professor
Ways in which animals adapt to their environment are often quite ingenious actually  And as an example of this  let me tell you about a fish  a group of fish known as the Notothenioids  There s over 90 known species of Notothenioids and they inhabit both shallow and very deep waters  mostly around Antarctica  Many are fairly small  though the largest species can weigh up to 150 kilograms  
Notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes  which are covered by a thick insulating layer of clear tissue  This tissue protects their eyes from freezing  Remember  the freezing point of ocean water  salt water  is lower than for fresh water  negative 1 9 degree Celsius   1 9°C   So it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean  say  than in a river or lake  So this means that the ocean waters around Antarctica are cold enough to freeze most types of fish  but Notothenioids don t freeze  In fact  they thrive  They account for some 95% of all fish in the southern ocean  the ocean that surrounds Antarctica  
So  how unusual is that  To have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean  I mean  think of…say  tropical or temperate marine environments  which have incredibly diverse fish populations  Coral reefs  for example  support over 4000 types of fish  along with sponges  crustaceans  and many other organisms  
So  exactly when and how did the Notothenioids come to dominate the southern ocean 
Well  around 30 million years ago  the waters around Antarctica were a lot warmer than they are today  Um   at that time  Antarctica was connected to South America  which means that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up the Antarctica waters  Because the water around Antarctica then was relatively warm  it supported many types of fish  And we know this from fossil evidence  
But the 90 or so species of Notothenioids that exist today didn t exist at all back then  In fact  only one ancestral Notothenioid species existed  But somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago  two major changes took place  
First  what we call a chance mutation  A tiny genetic change occurred in that one Notothenioid species  Its DNA allowed for the production of a special protein  a protein that prevents the fish from freezing  The way this…this anti freeze protein works is  it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish  This binding action prevents the ice crystals from growing larger  And this is what prevents Notothenioids from freezing  
Now  at that time  the waters the Notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold  so the protein didn t really make a difference as far as the fish s survival  But this would change  because in the same period of geologic time there was a shift in the earth s continental plates  Continental drift caused Antarctica to move apart from the landmass of South America and to drift into the Southern Polar Region  This resulted in a powerful water current encircling Antarctica  which prevented the Antarctic waters from mixing with warmer water  So the southern ocean  isolated from that warm airflow from the north  cooled down drastically  to the kinds of sub freezing temperatures we associate with it today 
Now  most fish species couldn t survive in this frigid environment and they became extinct  But that one Notothenioid species  with its unique ability to produce that anti freeze protein  thrived  It had virtually the entire southern ocean to itself  
So  Well  there was little or no competition for food or space  You might think of it as…um…as a…a kind of ecological vacuum  And the Notothenioids exploited fully  The species migrated into different habitats throughout the southern ocean  And its population increased dramatically  with various sub populations migrating into different parts of the ocean  Over time these sub populations in all those different habitats…well  they developed very different physical traits  They adapted to survive in their particular ecological niche  their…their position within a particular ecosystem  
We call this type of species diversification within a species adaptive radiation  And what adaptive radiation is is  an evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new species in order to fill multiple ecological niches  So in the case of the Notothenioids  that single species started colonizing empty habitats to such an extent that it evolved into a broad range of new species  the 90 or so Notothenioid species that we have today  So let me switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that s also been very successful  ?


Lecture4 – Art History  Renaissance Gardens 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 

Professor
OK  We have been talking about the art and architecture of the Italian Renaissance  from around A D  1400 to around A D  1600  Last class  we had a look at some of the magnificent palaces and villas built during this time period  And just as class was ending  someone asked about the gardens associated with these palaces and villas  And so I d like to say a few things about them before we move on 
Now  when I say gardens  I don t mean vegetable gardens or simple flower gardens  These were lavishly constructed  finely detailed gardens that covered hundreds of acres  with exotic plants and ornamental statues  And they were just as much a symbol of their owners  social position as their palaces and villas were  Again  what was the inspiration for the Renaissance  Rebecca 
Student
Classical art and architecture of the ancient Greeks and Romans  
Professor
That s right  As we ve said before  the main point of the Renaissance was to revive the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans  which is why designers of Renaissance gardens designed them as the ancient Romans would have designed them  or at least as they imagined the ancient Romans would have designed them  
Student
How did they know what ancient Roman gardens look like  
?
Professor
Well  they didn t have any pictures  But they did have some very detailed descriptions of ancient Roman villas and their gardens that had been written by famous Roman authors who lived during the height of the Roman Empire  And at least three of those authors  one was a scholar  one was a poet  and one was lawyer  were very authoritative  very reliable sources  
Ah…and interestingly enough  there was another source that didn t describe classical gardens but still became a great influence on Renaissance gardens  It was also written back during the height of the Roman Empire by a mathematician known as Hero of Alexandria  Hero was a Greek  But he lived in Alexandria  Egypt  which was at the time part of the Roman Empire  Hero compiled descriptions and sketches of seventy some clever little mechanical devices  most of which utilized compressed air to cause water  or in some cases wine  to flow from one place to another  or sometimes to squirt or to make some kind of noise  Yes  John 
Student
Could you give an example 
Professor
Well  one of the devices was a sacrificial vessel that was obviously designed for a temple  not for a garden  Anyway  if you drop money into this vessel  water would flow out of it  Well  creative minds in the Renaissance realized that this little device could be nicely repurposed as a nifty little fountain  Designers of Renaissance gardens loved this sort of thing  They loved to incorporate novelties and tricks  things to amuse and impress guests  
Student
And that was the purpose  To impress people 
Professor
Sure  As a nobleman or wealthy landowner  one purpose of having a fabulous villa with a fantastic garden was to impress people  It was a way of proving your social position  
?
Student
Well…OK  You also mentioned tricks  
Professor
Well  for example  some gardens had plaster or marble birds that sang when water flowed through them  Some fountains were designed to squirt people with water  
Student
And these things were popular 
Professor
Yes  They may have been the most popular features of the gardens  I mean  flowers and statues can be nice to look at  but these things were a lot more fun  And the more clever the device is  the more famous the garden and the greater prestige the landowner enjoyed  Yes  Rebecca  
Student
What about mazes  I read that they were a major part of the Renaissance gardens 
Professor
Oh  yes  They certainly were  Mazes or labyrinths  as they re also called  were very common in Renaissance gardens  How that came to be though is a bit of a mystery  Mazes have a long history going back to the ancient Egyptians  but they started appearing in gardens only during the Renaissance  or perhaps just a little bit prior to that  According to one source  what happened was  in the late 1400s  a highly respected expert published a book on architecture  And readers somehow mistakenly inferred from that book that ancient Romans had mazes in their gardens  So then designers of Renaissance gardens thinking they were following in the footsteps of the ancient Romans…well…guess what they did

Ready to check out 
Student
Just about  Before I do though  this book on early navigation…I have been using this book quite a bit for a research project  And I would like to own it actually  And well…it s an old book  and there were two copies on the shelf just now  so I was wondering if I could buy one  I was talking to this guy the other day  and he said the library sold books on occasion  Is that right 
Librarian
He is probably talking about our annual book sale  We have one every spring  
Student
OK  How do you decide which books to sell  Are they duplicates 
Librarian
A lot are duplicates  If we have more than one copy of a title and it hasn t been checked out in a few years  in that case it might end up at the sale  
Student
I ve actually tried to find this book online but no luck so far  I was really hoping to buy it 
Librarian
Well  that particular book…well  it probably won t be up for sale this year  Most books in the sale come from off site storage 

Student
Off site storage 
Librarian
That s where we keep books that haven t been used for several years  They are still in the catalog  which means they can be checked out if you fill out a form  It takes maybe a day or two to retrieve one of them  
Student
I see 
Librarian
And then before we decide to include a book in the sale  we review its circulation history again  which can take a while  We ve got a lot of books in storage  
Student
So it s basically the unpopular books that get put up for sale then 
Librarian
Well  that…plus the main thing is to make sure students have access to the information in the books  A lot of them are available in electronic format these days  even the really old ones  You know  they have been preserved that way 
Student
So most of the books for sale are older books  
Librarian
Well  we get book donations too  And lots of those are new  Again  a librarian reviews them and decides whether to catalogue them or put them up for sale  
Student
Is this sale open to the public 

Librarian
On the second day  It s a two day sale  The first day is for students  faculty and staff though  which is great  We usually need about twenty volunteers for the sale  And well  if you volunteer  you get first shot at everything in advance 
Student
Really  What do volunteers have to do 
Librarian
You help sort the books and set up the tables  But keep in mind those positions fill up quickly  
Now  about this particular book  it wouldn t hurt to send a formal request to the collection department  They might be able to let you know if it would be up for sale  
Student
I ll do that  Thanks

Lecture1 Art History  Dadaism 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 
 
Professor
All right  So last week we started talking about the painters and sculptors who were part of the art movement called Dada  But I don t want you to think the ideas we introduced last time were limited to painting  sculpture  that sort of thing  So today I want to move beyond the visual arts and talk a bit about Dada in the performing arts  in theater 
But let s start by reviewing what Dada is  OK  As you will recall  Dada began in Switzerland  in the city of Zurich  in 1916  The artists who studied it were reacting against traditional notions of beauty  of reason  of progress  which had been standards of western thought since the 18th century  They looked around  And well  I mean  the First World War was raging  so they didn t see much beauty  reason or progress in the world  Instead  they saw a world that was chaotic  random  a world that didn t make sense  And if that s the way the world was  well  they wanted their art to reflect that  
So let s…let s review a couple of key ideas that were the backbone of Dada art 
First  the Dadaists wanted to completely reject the classical idea of art  Classical ideas like proportion  balance…all the things you think about when you think about great art  Great art involved reason  the logic  the beauty that the Dadaists wanted to overthrow 
So  well  you know  to a Dadaist  classical artwork was a reflection of outdated thinking  That s why Dadaists created sculptures like the ones we saw last week  Remember the stool with the bicycle wheel mounted on top  I wouldn t exactly called that beautiful  would you  But of course it wasn t meant to be  That was the point  
OK  
So another key Dada idea we talked about was the embracing of randomness  Right  Uh…if life is random  said the Dadaists  why would we make art that has order and logic  And so we have that collage we looked at  with an artist took different  you know  cut out squares of colored paper  threw them onto the canvas  and wherever they landed  that was the composition of the work  The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird  QQ5l9626928  
Another favorite of the Dadaists was something called chance poetry  A chance poet would pull words out of a hat and that would be…that would make up the poem  And this idea of chance and randomness was a key element of Dadaism because the whole world seemed so random to them  
So now let s take a look at how Dadaist ideas represented to audiences in highly unconventional…well…I am not even sure how to categorize these theatrical events  I suppose you just have to call them shows  These shows started in Zurich in a place called the Cabaret Voltaire  
The rejection of classical western art  well  you see this in the nature of what took place at the Cabaret Voltaire  They didn t put on plays or operas there  What they did was throw out all conventions  
They mixed everything and anything together  They would…it might start with somebody reading a poem  Then somebody else playing an instrument  followed by a display of paintings  followed by somebody else chanting  followed by somebody else banging on a big drum  and someone dressed in a robot costume jumping up and down  So it s not like a play  There s no real plot development here like you d find in the traditional theatrical performance  
The performers at the Cabaret Voltaire would also get the audience involved  which was extremely unusual  Think about a traditional play  The action s self contained  The actors act as if there is no one watching  right  It s like a world unto itself  Well  at the Cabaret Voltaire  audience members could get up on stage and dance  or chant  or shout and sing from their seats  
And every night would be different  because there would be a different audience and a different set of acts and displays  
So all these could get pretty chaotic  No barriers between the performers and the audience  and no barriers between kinds of art either  Think about it  poetry  paintings  music  dance…all on the same stage and often at the same time  
This is what the Dadaists had in mind  When they set out to make art that reflected their own idea of reality  it didn t make sense  But why should it

Lecture2 Environmental Engineering  APS digestion 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental engineering class 
Professor
At the end of yesterday s class  we were discussing landfills and the hundreds of millions of tons of everyday garbage which are deposited into them each year in the United States  It s a growing problem  Quite simply  we are running out of space to put our garbage  And this is especially true for solid organic waste  food scraps from home or food processing plants  waste from farms  that sort of thing  Did you know that two thirds of the waste sitting in our landfills is organic material  We have government recycling programs for materials like plastics  glass and metal  yet widespread solutions for organic waste materials haven t really been addressed in the United States  I think this is just asking for trouble in the future  
So today I want to talk about a technology that offers a potential solution to the problem Anaerobic Phased Solids digestion  or APS digestion 
First of all  what does anaerobic mean  Anyone  
Student
Without oxygen 
Professor
Correct  APS digestion uses anaerobic bacteria  ones that thrive in the absence of oxygen  to consume  to break down organic material  
Student
Excuse me  Professor  Um…those anaerobic bacteria you are talking about…well  aren t anaerobic bacteria also used in waste water treatment plants 
Professor
Yes  They are  Would you like to explain this to the class 
Student
Sure  So when waste water is treated  one of the byproducts is a thick liquid called sludge  And aren t anaerobic bacteria used to break down the sludge 
Professor
That s right  Anaerobic bacteria have been used in waste water treatment for decades  
Student
So how is this technology different 
Professor
Good question  The anaerobic digestion systems used in waste water plants are designed to treat sludge  not solids  Now  in the past  researchers have attempted to treat solid organic waste with that same equipment  
But there was always a problem  
In order to process the solid waste  the kind we find in landfills  you had to pretreat the solids to turn them into sludge  
First  by breaking the material apart mechanically into small particles and then adding a lot of water until you got a kind of thick  soupy mix that the equipment could handle  But that extra step took time and required a lot of energy  
Student
That sounds like it would cost a lot  

Professor
That s right  But APS digestion is designed specifically to handle solid waste  So it is much more cost effective 
The new technology processes organic waste in two phases  Remember  APS stands for Anaerobic Phased Solids digestion  
First  the waste material is loaded into a large  closed container  along with different types of anaerobic bacteria  The bacteria break the solids down into acids and hydrogen gas  The hydrogen is extracted and the remaining acids are transferred into a different container for the second phase of the process  There another type of bacteria converts the acids into methane gas  
Student
Aren t hydrogen and methane gas bad for the environment though 
Professor
The answer in this case is no  because they don t escape into the atmosphere  The gases are captured and can be burned to produce electricity  which saves a lot of money and ultimately decreases our need for fuels like petroleum and coal  which are not only expensive but are also polluting 
Student
So organic waste from landfills could be processed this way 
Professor
It is certainly one possibility  And APS digestion systems are very versatile  They can be installed just about anywhere  See  anaerobic digestion systems used at waste water treatment plants are huge tanks that hold thousands of gallons of waste water  But the APS containers are small enough to be set up on site  where the waste is generated  like at food processing plants or on farms  So garbage doesn t have to be transported long distances  As a matter of fact  a couple of universities successfully set up demonstration projects  They collected food scraps from dining halls and local restaurants and process them in APS facilities  Not only did the university save money  we are also learning even more about the APS process 
What is the next step forward  
Well  APS digestion uses several different types of anaerobic bacteria  right  So what are the most efficient bacteria in the process  If researchers can figure that out  the highest performing bacteria mix for a system could be determined  Ultimately the goal would be to grow enough of these particular bacteria to support large scale commercial APS systems

Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her creative writing professor 
Student
Hello  Professor Thomson  Could I talk to you for a minute 
Professor
Oh  Hi  Laura  We missed you last class 
Student
Yeah  I was sick for a few days  Um…I was wondering   did I miss a lot of work  
Professor
Let s see…well  we discussed the story that you have been assigned to read for class  A Memory by Eudora Welty  And then we listened to a recording of an interview with Welty  The recording is on reserve at the library  You ll need to listen to it  So…did you have a chance to read the story 
Student
Yeah  I did  
Professor
What did you think  
Student
Well…I was a little surprised  I mean  the first time I read it anyway  
Professor
What surprised you 


Student
You know  it just seemed like there was nothing going on in the story  I mean  a girl is just sitting at the beach thinking about one of her memories  And at the same time  she is watching other bathers on the beach  and sort of just thinking about what they are doing too  And that s all that happens  So at the end of the story  I thought  that s it  
Professor
I know what you mean  There s no surprise ending like in O  Henry s story The Gift of the Magi or some big adventure like in Faulkner s The Bear 
So you didn t like the story 
Student
Well  actually  while I was reading it the second time  I sort of realized that you don t need surprises or excitement to have a great story    The girl s memory and the stuff she was thinking about while she was watching the other people on the beach were really interesting to read about  And you know  it made me think that when I write my story  the one we have to write for this class  I can maybe use my own memories to get me started 
Professor
Well  in fact  I d hoped you d see that  Of course  there are many levels to the story  But what I really wanted the class to take away from it was that you don t need to write about the great exciting world when you write you stories  Even writing about a memory can work  
Student
Like I could write about one of the times I took a walk in the woods when I was a kid 
Professor
Exactly  You know  as the due day of your stories approaches  I am hearing from a lot of students that they are worried because they don t have anything exciting enough to write about  But Welty said in the interview we listened to and in her autobiography that her worst stories were the ones where she tried to write about people or places that were unfamiliar to her  That s why a lot of her stories are set in Mississippi  where she is from  Welty stressed that  for her anyway  familiarity with her subject matter was the key to a successful story  
Student
Familiarity  That makes sense  Thanks Professor Thomson 
Professor
No problem  Now  don t forget to listen to that recording

Lecture3 Botany  Plants and Pollinators 
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class 
 
Professor
When we talk about pollination ecology  we are talking about the relationship between a plant and its pollinator  From the plants  perspective  the ideal pollinator is an animal that is under fed  ready to eat and in a hurry  The pollinator  on the other hand  wants to remain well fed with as little effort as possible  These factors help drive the evolution of plants and their pollinators  both of which depend on this balanced and delicate relationship  Sometimes only certain insects or birds can pollinate certain plant species  So to really understand pollination ecology  both the flower and its pollinators must be studied  
Let s start with flowers 
There are several important factors associated with pollination  when and how often a plan flowers  how long the flowering cycle lasts  and the number of flowers that open at the same time  For example  flowering may coincide with the migration of a certain animal species that pollinates the plant  or producing many flowers at once may increase the number of pollinators a plant attracts  
Other characteristics of flowers are also important  Features such as color  scent and shape attract pollinators  as does the reward in the flower  the pollen or the nectar  that feeds the pollinator  For example  flowers that attract bats tend to be green or cream colored  because visibility is important  Bats are practically blind  remember  And these flowers bloom at night when bats are active 
Now  there s a flower in the Amazon rainforest called a royal water lily and the characteristics of its flowers change during the pollination process  The royal water lily uses color  temperature and scent to attract the beetles that pollinate it  When the flowers of the royal water lily first open up  when they first bloom  they are white  They also emit a strong odor and their temperature rises  Producing heat serves two purposes  It magnifies the scent of the flower and it helps the beetles maintain their body temperature  When a beetle arrives at the flower  the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that the beetle becomes covered with pollen  Then when the flower opens  its color changes to red and it cools down  When the beetle flies out  it carries the pollen to a different  heated  white  fragrant flower  
As you can see  plants go to a lot of trouble to attract attention  So what kind of attention are they attracting  And why  
Well  sometimes flowers provide shelter for insects  a place to lay eggs for instance  But usually the attraction is food  nectar and pollen  Nectar is mainly a sugar solution  while pollen is a grain made up of part of the plant s cell structure   In both nectar and pollen production  quality and quantity vary over time  But they are always related to the needs of the pollinator  
You can see that the relationship between pollinators and plants are delicate  so any number of factors can disturb them  
Human development is one  And agriculture is generally believed to be the most harmful  It can fragment habitats in a variety of ways  reducing the number of pollinators  which in turn may reduce the number or size of the flowers  which of course affects the animals that feed on them  Exotic plant species not native to the area can move in and compete  Even bees brought in to pollinate crops can alter natural pollen dispersal systems of rainforest plants  
On the other hand  recent studies have shown that the disruption of one aspect of the pollination cycle doesn t usually lead to the extinction of other species  It turns out that plant pollinator relationships are more adaptable to change than we thought  So really it is hard to know just how agriculture affects the pollination of plants  ?

Lecture4 Business Management  The Life Cycle of Innovation 
Narrator
Listen to part of a discussion in a business management class 
 
Professor
Last week we were talking about innovation in business  Remember the graph I showed you  
Student
The curve that looked sort of like the letter S 
Professor
Right  Cathy  Let s take another look  Do you recall  Cathy  How this S curve represents the life cycle of innovation 
Student
Sure  Starting on the left  the new innovation  let s say it s a new product  Almost nobody s heard of it or at least nobody takes it seriously  Then its popularity increases  uh  slowly at first till sales really start accelerating quickly  They are where the line goes up steeply in the middle as more and more get excited about the product and they go out and buy it  But eventually  moving over to the right side there  interest begins to fade and the growth and sales levels off 
Professor
At which point the market has matured for that product  We can still sell it and even marginally improve it  but it s not new anymore  It no longer offers exciting growth opportunities  So a business leader might face a choice  either stick with this old  safe  proven idea or move on to the next big idea  a fresh innovation  But innovations are risky  They may succeed or they may not  
OK  A case study  
George  I have heard your Thursday night program on the campus radio station  You like Jazz  right  
Student
Huh   Uh…yeah…sure  But…what  
Professor
OK  Stay with me here  On your program last week  I heard an old Miles Davis album  Tell us about that  
Student
Uh…Miles Davis  Trumpet  I played a CD of a Jazz classic he recorded in the 1950s called Kind of Blue  It s my all time favorite Jazz recording  
Professor
Mine too  Would you call that recording innovative for its time  
Student
Absolutely  Nothing at all like what he had recorded up till then  I mean  before that Miles Davis played things so complex that…well…nobody could touch him  But this was something totally new  Suddenly his playing sounded so amazingly simple 
Professor
And how did people react to this new sound of Miles Davis 
Student
Well…some were disappointed  even angry that he d abandon his old style  But soon most of his fans came around and this new style appealed to a whole new group of jazz listeners  
Professor
I guess so  Kind of Blue became the most commercially successful album in the history of jazz  So is there a lesson here anyone  Think of that S curve I showed you  
Student
Oh  So his old style of jazz was actually a kind of product  one that had been developed pretty thoroughly  And he d taken it about as far as he could  So he decided to take a big risk and try something totally new  
Professor
Exactly  Something completely fresh and cool  And people couldn t get enough of it  It was a brand new beginning that left lots of room for further development artistically  And as a market analyst  you could say that with Kind of Blue  he was jumping to the beginning of a brand new S curve  With all that potential for profitable development still ahead of him 
But let me ask you something else  This isn t just the music of a single performer  is it  George 
Student
Hardly  More like a group of all stars   Along with Miles Davis on trumpet  there is Bill Evans on piano  John Coltrane on tenor saxophone…
Professor
Individually perhaps the best in the business  But thinking of Miles Davis as the leader of this group  how did he organize and manage all these incredible talent  
Student
Well  he d lay out the general outline  the theme and then give each of these star performers  one by one  the creative freedom to really show what they could do with it on their own instrument  to improvise and add something new  but always within the same general theme  
Professor
So Miles Davis gets credit for recruiting the best jazz talent anywhere and getting them to collaborate on a fantastic musical product  
Everyone see the business parallels here  
And give each of these musicians credit for seizing this opportunity and creating great individual performances  
But good jazz is more than just individual performance  isn t it 
Student
Definitely  Jazz musicians need to listen to each other and go with the flow  Like  one time somebody goofed and came in a little early  but everyone else adjusted and went right along with it  as if nothing were wrong  And this mistake came out like just another unexpected creative interpretation  
Professor
Thanks  George  Great insights  ones that would certainly apply to what we are studying here

Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the campus computer center 
Computer center employee
Hi  what can I help you with today 
Student
Hi  um  I wanted to you see  the thing is  I don t know much about computers  so I was wondering if  uh  if there s a class or something       so I can learn how to use computers  like to write papers for my classes 
Computer center employee
Oh  I see       u m  we don t really offer a course for beginners  since most students already have computing experience  But all the computers in our labs have a general tutorial installed on them  You could just go there and run it 
Student
And the tutorial explains everything  I mean  it might sound strange but I ve never used a computer 
Computer center employee
Well  all the computer labs on campus are staffed with student assistants  and I m sure that any one of them would be more than willing to get you started 
Student
Yeah  That sounds good  But is it expensive 
Computer center employee
No  in fact  it won t cost anything  it s one of the services of the computer center 
Student
That s great  How do they l mean  how do I get in touch with the student assistants  Should I just go to a computer lab and ask whoever s there 
Computer center employee
Sure  you could do that  or I can let you have a list of names of the students who are assistants in the labs  You might know one of them 
Student
Actually  I think I d prefer someone I don t know  um  so I can ask dumb questions       Is there anyone you d recommend 
Computer center employee
All of our student assistants are really knowledgeable about computers  I mean  they have to be  in order to work in the computer labs       It doesn t mean that they re necessarily good at teaching beginners       but you probably won t be a beginner for very long 
Student
Hope not 
Computer center employee
And I just thought of something else  The bookstore has a lot of books on computers there might be one for people like you  I mean  people who don t have a lot of experience with computers  I actually bought one for my father so he could learn how to use e mail  basic word processing  that sort of thing and it worked pretty well for him 
Student
OK  I II try that  too  And if the bookstore doesn t have it  they can just order it for me 
Computer center employee
Right  Now is there anything else I can help you with today 
Student
Uh  just the list of names and the times they re working  I d like to get going on this as soon as possible 
Computer center employee
Right  Good luck 




纸质版TPO4 lecture1（economics）

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class 

Professor
When attempting to understand international trade  some things seem so obvious that they can hardly be controverted  and other points that are important are invisible unless you ve thought about the subject carefully 
Consider the following  if there s an increase in imports  let s say  um  let s say imports of furniture  and the domestic producers of furniture find this new competition very difficult and are cutting production and employment  then it seems obvious and easy to understand and many people conclude from this that increasing imports will cause generally greater unemployment at home 
What is not so obvious is that how much we import and how much we export     those are interdependent and you can t understand the one without the other  But the exports that are generated are not easily discernable  so most people don t see them  They see only the imports of furniture rising and employment in domestic furniture production falling 
So as a result  many people argue that we ought to protect jobs by limiting imports either by tariffs  quotas  regulations  or whatever without realizing that this also has the effect of reducing potential future exports to the rest of the world  things that we can produce very  very       cost effectively and therefore profitably 
The fundamental proposition in international economics is that it makes sense to import those things that we       that can be produced more economically abroad than at home and export things to the rest of the world that we can produce more cost effectively than produced elsewhere in the world  Therefore  if we limit imports  we put ourselves in danger of not being able to export 
The details of this relationship will take much longer to explain than I can fully go into now but the point of the matter is that gains the benefits of gains from international trade result from being able to get things cheaper by buying them abroad than you can make them at home  Now there re some things that we can make at home that are       that we can do more economically than they can do abroad 
In the case of the United States  typically high technology products  uh       are things that Americans have innovated in and started firms doing that sort of thing at which they do very well  Whereas goods that produce       that use a lot of relatively low skill labor  like furniture production  cotton production  sugar production       those are things that are frequently made more inexpensively in places where wage rates are low and the cost of using capital is very high 
However  in Florida they produce a lot of sugar  but the costs are so high  if we didn t have extensive restrictions on imports of sugar  the output of sugar would decline dramatically  But the sugar industry in the U S  doesn t produce high paying jobs  it uses resources in ineffective ways and it blocks the import of more cost effectively produced sugar  It  it s a very bad bargain for the people in the United States to want to protect low paying jobs thereby halting the growth of world trading and international       uh  more international specialization  It would be better to remove restrictions on imports and allow other countries in the world       countries that can produce them more cheaply       let them specialize in producing those products 
Now  I agree that people who are directly affected by imports  what they focus on       is  is that their prospects       their job prospects are being reduced  and their economic circumstances are getting worse  And that s a relevant problem and an important problem  what isn t so obvious is       that by retraining and relocating people to places and industries where jobs are expanding rather than contracting  we can make the whole economy function more effectively and productively than by trying to block imports 
Um  what is interesting to note is that  even if there were no international trade issues  like imports  any changes that occur in a country s economy any new technology  change in preferences  change in regulations or whatever will lead to  adjustments  that lead some sectors of the economy to decline and others to expand 
And that s what we have to figure out  and that s a hard problem to deal with in detail  is how to facilitate people adjusting from sectors where their job prospects are not so good  and in particular where real wages aren t so high  to acquire skills that will permit them to move into higher paying jobs in other parts of the economy either by retraining or relocating  Helping pay for the relocation of these people would be very helpful  but trying to block the changes is really counterproductive  It makes people in our country poorer  and it makes people elsewhere in the world poorer as well 
纸质版TPO4 lecture2 biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class 

Professor
I want to continue our discussion about whales  Specifically  today  um  I want to talk about whale migration um  why whales head south for the winter  Or really why whales in the cold water of the Northern Hemisphere head south for the winter  Now  not all kinds of whales migrate  but most baleen whales do 

And interestingly enough  we still don t really know why the baleen whales migrate  We do have several theories  however  which I II discuss today  U h  can anybody name one reason why baleen whales might migrate south  to the warm tropical water 

Male student
Uh  for food  You know  the whales move to warmer water in order to find a good area to feed 
Professor
Good guess  That should be an obvious reason after all  most animals that migrate do so for the purpose of finding food  But  uh  that doesn t seem to be the case with baleen whales  To understand why  you need to know something about water temperature  There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now  But let s just say that nutrients don t rise to the surface of tropical water like they do in other kinds of water  Tropical water simply never gets cold enough  So       well  what this means  uh  is that tropical water doesn t have much of the plankton that most whales feed on 
Male student
I don t understand if there s no plankton  how do the whales survive through the winter 
Professor
Right  How do they survive  You see  they don t have to eat anything  because they ve stored up so much fat during the summer feeding season that they can just survive off of that  So if they don t need to eat anything  we re back to our original question  Why do baleen whales migrate  Any theories  No 
Well  there s one idea out there that a lot of people believe  In fact  uh  you could say it s the most popular theory we have about whale migration  Basically  the argument is that for baleen whales  migration is a kind of balancing act  Let me explain  On one hand  whales need to take advantage of the summer months by eating as much food as they can  And that s what they can do best in the northern seas  This allows them to build up a lot of fat  But in the winter  food is scarce even in the north  so what the whales need to do is save energy  And that s what migrating south can help them do       Amanda  you have a question 

Female student
Yes  Um  the balancing act theory doesn t make sense to me  Maybe whales might need to save energy during the winter  but wouldn t moving all the way down to tropics make them lose energy 
Professor
That s a good point  and it s one reason why this isn t a perfect theory  It does cost the whales energy to migrate  but it s easier for whales to save energy in warm water than it is to save energy in cold water  so there might still be  you know  a good reason to move south for the winter  OK 

Now  before moving on to the next chapter  I want to briefly discuss how the baleen whale manages to navigate  It s pretty remarkable  because the whales manage to return to the same places year after year  and have to travel over an enormous area of ocean in order to do it  I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right  So exactly how do they do it 
Well  a lot of experimental work still needs to be done  but we have been able to figure out at least three ways the baleen whale navigates without getting lost  The first is the ability to use Earth s magnetic field like it was a map  That sounds strange  but we know that many birds use that method  use the magnetic field  and it s possible that whales have the biological ability to do the same thing 
Another theory is that if they stay close to the coast  whales might be able to find familiar landmarks and use those as guides  But we don t really know if a whale s eye sight is good enough to be able to do that  so that s not a perfect theory 
And finally  we know that many whales make very loud sounds that can travel literally hundreds of miles underwater  Through a process called echolocation  it s possible that these whales hear the sounds bounce off of islands or other pieces of land and use those echoes as clues to help them find their way 

Narrator
Listen again to part of the lecture  Then answer the question 
Professor
To understand why  you need to know something about water temperature  There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now  But let s just say that nutrients don t rise to the surface of tropical water like they do in other kinds of water 
Narrator
What does the professor mean when she says this 
Professor
There are a lot of technical reasons that I m not going to go into right now 

Narrator
Listen again to part of the lecture  Then answer the question 
Professor
It s pretty remarkable  because the whales manage to return to the same places year after year  and have to trawl over an enormous area of ocean in order to do it  I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right

What point does the professor make when she says this 
Professor
I mean  it s not like whales can just look at a map  right 
纸质版TPO4 conversation 2

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor 
Student
Hi  uh… Professor Anderson… wondering if you had a couple minutes      
Professor
Of course  Paula… 
Student
Thanks       uh  you sent me a letter recently about doing  uh  an honors project inviting me to come in and talk about      
Professor
Right  right  well  as your academic advisor  it s my job to look out for your academic interests  and based on your grades  and some very positive feedback I ve heard from your professors  I wanted to formally invite you to consider doing an honors project      
Student
Yeah       well  thanks       uh  actually I kinda wanted to ask you       quite frankly like how much work it would probably be  I mean  I m gonna be spending a lot of time applying to law schools next semester and      
Professor
Well  let me tell you how it works       and then you can decide from there 
Student
OK
Professor
Basically  the honors project is an opportunity to do       some in depth work on a topic you re interested in before graduating college  You register for the class  but it doesn t work the same way a regular class does you find a professor who you want to work with you ask the professor a sort of mentor who s knowledgeable on the topic you re interested in the topic you re gonna write your honors thesis on      
Student
Writing a thesis  That s part of the project  Ah  like how many pages are we talking 
Professor
Usually about 50       but it s a valuable experience  writing a thesis paper 
Student
So  basically  after I register for the class  I need to ask a professor who ll sorta help me…
Professor
Actually  you need to do that a professor needs to agree to oversee your honors project before you register 
Student
Oh  OK…
Professor
I mean  I know it sounds kinda daunting  but that s what the professor s there for to help guide you through the different steps of the process and       uh       most students are very pleased with the experience       they re able to demonstrate advanced research skills  which is important  especially in your case  writing an honors thesis would be a big plus     
Student
You think so 
Professor
Absolutely  Especially considering your plans  since you re applying to law schools  It shows initiative  that you ve done well as an undergraduate to be allowed to do the honors project       that you re able to work independently and  of course  you would graduate with honors      
Student
Yeah  it does sound good it s just  you know  l ve never written something like that before  so      
Professor
Well  you choose something you re interested in maybe you can even expand a shorter research paper from another class or      
Student
So  like  maybe       You know  I took this course from Professor Connelly his course on Comparative Governments last semester and  uh       did pretty well l wrote a paper actually  on political parties in Venezuela and and he seemed to like my research  Anyway  he  uh  I got an A in the course 
Professor
Good  so it sounds like you do have a general idea for a topic  and you might know what professor you want to work with       and look  it s still a couple weeks before registration  maybe you should talk to Professor Connelly and then get back to me 
Student
Yeah  I will thanks  I II come by again sometime next week 
Professor
That s fine  Good luck 

Narrator
What does Professor Anderson imply when he says this 
Professor
      they re able to demonstrate advanced research skills  which is important  especially in your case  writing an honors thesis would be a big plus      

Narrator
What does the woman imply when she says this 
Student
Yeah  it does sound good it s just  you know  I ve never written something like that before       so      





纸质版TPO4 Lecture 3 journalism

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a journalism class  The professor has been discussing newspapers 

Professor
About 40 years ago  half of all Americans felt they d be lost without a daily newspaper  But today  only one in ten Americans say they d be lost without a paper  In fact  today  half of all Americans say they don t need a newspaper at all  And so people in the newspaper industry are trying to figure out how they can get more people reading the newspaper more often  They re trying to crack journalism s riddle for the ages  what makes people read newspapers  OK  well  let me ask you as a journalism student  what do you think is the answer to this question  Elizabeth 

Female student
U m  I would probably try to improve the content of the newspaper 
Professor 
Better content  Hmm  You mean like well written editorials and articles 
Female student
Well  I mean provide more interesting content  like  I would first try to find out what readers really want to read       and then put that into the paper 
Professor
Yes  in fact  not too long ago  there was an extensive study conducted to investigate what draws people to newspapers  Uh  they found out that there s a clear  strong link between satisfaction with content and overall readership  Those newspapers that contained what the readers wanted most brought in the most readers  No big surprise there  right  So  what kind of content brings in readers  The study found that people centered local news ranks at the top of the list       stories about ordinary people  For example  you could write about the experiences of those who were involved in a news story  and their friends and relatives       The vantage points would be those of ordinary people  not of police or other officials       OK  Now the study also showed that people want more stories about movies  TV  and weather  and fewer stories and photos about natural disasters and accidents       So  to get reader satisfaction  you need to select the right topics  and within those topics  the right news events or stories to cover  Yes  James 

Male student
It seems to me that a lot of what you just mentioned doesn t line up with the principles of good journalism  Catering to readers  tastes may improve overall readership  but what about the social responsibilities that newspapers have  I mean  there are some topics that newspapers need to write about in order to serve the public interest  Those topics may not always be fun and interesting for the average reader  but it s still the newspaper s responsibility to make that information available to the public 
Professor
That s a good point  You need a good mix of content  You can t just rush towards an attractive topic and forget about the reporting role of newspapers  There s a danger of going soft newspapers do have to perform their obligations to citizens  So what newspapers sometimes do is to combine serious journalism with a reader friendly presentation  Um  let me give you an example  When the justice department opened an investigation on the local police some pretty serious stuff that could be boring to some readers well  one local newspaper ran a lead story on their front page  but they also simplified the format by including small breakout boxes that presented in a nutshell the highlights of the story  That way  they could report the serious stories they needed to report  and  and still hold their readers  attention  OK  U h  going back to the research on readership growth we were talking about       Uh  the most vital step of all  the study shows  may be making the paper easier to use  How can we make the paper  easier to use   Well  it means stories need to include information  such as phone numbers  times  dates  addresses  Web sites and the like  so that readers can  go and do  things based on what they ve read 
Female student
Professor Ellington  Um  when you said we need to make the paper  easier to user  I thought you were gonna say something about use of graphics  colors  and stuff like that 
Professor
Well  I guess those things do help in a way  but it turned out that those contemporary touches  uh  such as more attractive designs  extensive use of color  and informational graphics matter much less than you d expect  Surprising  isn t it 
Female student
Yeah  it is       Um  how about service  Does the study say anything about improving service  I don t think people are gonna subscribe if the paper doesn t arrive  or shows up late     
Professor
Or shows up wet  which by the way  happened to me this morning  Oh  absolutely  Service affects readership  In fact  improving your service is much more likely to increase your readership than making changes in your editorial content       Not only on time delivery in good condition  but also things like efficient billing  affordability  um      Yes 
Female student
They could also  like  increase the number of sites where they sell single copies 
Professor
Certainly that s one way to improve service 

Narrator
What does the student imply when ha says this 
Male student
It seems to me that a lot of what you just mentioned doesn t line up with the principles of good journalism  Catering to readers  tastes may improve overall readership  but what about the social responsibilities that newspapers have

Um  beginning in the late 1960s  geologists began to uncover some evidence of a rather surprising kind when they looked       um       at various places around the world  What they found out when they examined rocks from about a       the period from about 750 million years ago to about 580 million years ago  they found that       it seemed that glaciers covered the entire surface of the Earth from pole to pole  including the tropics 
Um       how did they come to this astonishing conclusion  What was the evidence for this  Especially when glaciers today are found only at the poles       or in the mountains 
Well  uh       basically when glaciers grow and move they leave behind a distinctive deposit consisting of primarily       of  at least on the top level  of ground up little bits of rock       almost       they almost look like rocks that have been deposited by streams  if you ve ever seen those  And that s caused because  although the glacier is ice  it is actually flowing very slowly and as it moves it grinds the top layer of rock  it breaks off pieces and carries them away  So when you have glaciation you have a distinctive pattern of these pieces of rock which are called  erratics  

Erratics are rocks       they re the stones that are often carried long distances by glaciers 
So  in the 1960s and onward up through the 1990s  we keep finding evidence for glaciation  no matter what the latitude       even in tropical latitudes  Now  today there are glaciers in the tropics but only at very high elevations  But 750 million years ago  apparently there were glaciers even at sea level in the tropics 
How could this have happened 
Well  first       the growth of glaciers  uh  benefits  if you will  from a kind of a positive feedback loop called the  ice albedo effect  

With the ice albedo effect  glaciers  cause they re white reflect light and heat more       much more than does liquid water       or soil and rock  which are dark and absorb heat  So  the more glaciers there are  the more heat is reflected  so the climate gets cooler  and glaciers grow even more 
However       normally  on a global scale  there is a major process that functions to curb the growth of glaciers  And  that process involves carbon dioxide 

Now  we re all familiar with the notion that carbon dioxide is what we call a  green house gas   The more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere  the more heat the atmosphere retains  That s what a greenhouse gas does  So  the greenhouse gas effect is kinda the opposite of the albedo effect 
Um       now as it happens       when silicate rocks  which is a very common class of rock  when they re exposed to the air and to normal weathering  they erode  Carbon dioxide is attracted to these eroding rocks and binds to them  forming calcium carbonate 
Calcium carbonate is eventually washed into the ocean where it settles to the bottom  This process  this forming of calcium carbonate  has the effect of sucking the carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it at the bottom of the ocean 

Now  follow me here  The process that s sucking carbon dioxide out of the air  keeping the greenhouse gas levels low  cannot happen if the rock is covered with ice 
So  while glaciers reflect light and heat       cooling the Earth  they at the same time cover rocks so there s less calcium carbonate formed       which leaves more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  Higher levels of carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere warm       which slows the growth of glaciers  So  it s a balance  and the glacier growth remains pretty much under control 
Now  what happened 750 million years ago to upset that balance  It seems a relatively simple explanation actually      
750 million years ago       all the major continents are rocky  bare  and pretty much lined up along the equator  they hadn t yet moved to where they are today  So  what happened was  perhaps a slight cooling of       the very slight and temporary cooling of the Sun which still happens from time to time and the Earth starts to cool  the ice starts to spread on the oceans       starting at the poles 
Now  by the time the ice reaches about two thirds of the way to the equator  it s too late 
See       because the continents are the last things to be covered by glaciers  they continue weathering       the rocks keep eroding and the carbon dioxide levels keep falling       So  the ice albedo effect from the glaciers is increasing in strength while the atmosphere continues to lose its ability to retain heat making glacier growth unstoppable  Now you have what s called a  runaway freeze   And for perhaps as long as 50 million years  possibly with some interludes  the Earth was frozen from pole to pole  like a giant snowball

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an admissions officer at City College 
Student
Hi  Can I ask you a few questions about starting classes during your summer session 
Admissions officer
Sure  Ask away  It starts next week  you know 
Student
Yeah  and I want to get some required courses out of the way so I can       maybe I can graduate one term earlier and get out into the job market sooner 
Admissions officer
That sounds like a good idea  Let me pull up the summer school database on my computer here      
Student
OK 
Admissions officer
OK  there it is  What s your student ID number 
Student
Oh  well  the thing is       I m not actually admitted here  I ll be starting school upstate at Hooper University in the fall  But I m down here for the summer  staying with my grandparents   cause I have a summer job near here 
Admissions officer
Oh  I see  well      
Student
So I m outta luck 
Admissions officer
Well  you would be if you were starting anywhere but Hooper  But City College has a sort of special relationship with Hooper       a full exchange agreement       so our students can take classes at Hooper and vice versa  So if you can show me proof       um  your admissions letter from Hooper  then I can get you into our system here and give you an ID number 
Student
Oh  cool  So       um       I wanna take a math course and a science course preferably biology  And I was also hoping to get my English composition course out of the way  too 
Admissions officer
Well all three of those courses are offered in the summer  but you ve gotta understand that summer courses are condensed you meet longer hours and all the assignments are doubled up because       it s the same amount of information presented and tested as in a regular term  but it s only six weeks long  Two courses are considered full time in summer term  Even if you weren t working  I couldn t let you register for more than that 
Student
Yeah  I was half expecting that  What about the schedule  Are classes only offered during the day 
Admissions officer
Well  during the weak  we have some classes in the daytime and some at night  and on the weekends  we have some classes all day Saturday or all day Sunday for the six weeks 
Student
My job is pretty flexible  so one on a weekday and one on a weekend shouldn t be any problem  OK  so after I bring you my admissions letter  how do I sign up for the classes 
Admissions officer
Wall  as soon as your student ID number is assigned and your information is in our admissions system  you can register by phone almost immediately 
Student
What about financial aid  Is it possible to get it for the summer 
Admissions officer
Sorry  but that s something you would ve had to work out long before now  But the good news is that the tuition for our courses is about half of what you re going to be paying at Hooper 
Student
Oh  well that helps  Thank you so much for answering all my questions  I ll be back tomorrow with my letter 
Admissions officer
I won t be here then  but do you see that lady sitting at that desk over here  That s Ms  Brinker  I ll leave her a note about what we discussed  and she ll get you started 
Student
Cool

纸质版TPO5 Lecture1 world history

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class 

Professor
In any introductory course  I think it s always a good idea to step back and ask our selves  What are we studying in this class  and why are we studying it  
So  for example  when you looked at the title of this course in the catalog  Introduction to World History  what did you think you were getting into       what made you sign up for it  besides filling the social science requirement 
Anyone       

Male student
Well       just the the history of everything       you know  starting at the beginning       with       I guess  the Greeks and Romans       the Middle Ages  the Renaissance       you know  that kinda stuff       like what we did in high school 
Professor
OK       Now  what you re describing is one approach to world history 

In fact  there are several approaches basic  models  or  conceptual frameworks  of what we study when we  do  history  And what you studied in high school what I call the  Western Heritage Model   this used to be the most common approach in U S  high schools and colleges       in fact  it s the model I learned with  when I was growing up back oh  about a hundred years ago      
Uh       at Middletown High School  up in Maine      l guess it made sense to my teachers back then since  well  the history of western Europe was the cultural heritage of everyone in my class       and this remained the dominant approach in most U S  schools till       oh  maybe       30  40 years ago       But it doesn t take more than a quick look around campus even just this classroom today to see that the student body in the U S  is much more diverse than my little class in Middletown High       and this Western Heritage Model was eventually replaced by or sometimes combined with one or more of the newer approaches       and I wanna take a minute to describe these to you today  so you can see where this course fits in 
OK       so       up until the mid twentieth century  the basic purpose of most world history courses was to learn about a set of values       institutions       ideas       which were considered the  heritage  of the people of Europe things like       democracy       legal systems       types of social organization       artistic achievements      
Now  as I said  this model gives us a rather limited view of history  So  in the 1960s and 70s it was combined with or replaced by what I call the  Different Cultures Model   The  60s were a period in which people were demanding more relevance in the curriculum  and there was criticism of the European focus that you were likely to find in all the academic disciplines  For the most part  the Different Cultures Model didn t challenge the basic assumptions of the Western Heritage Model  What it did was insist on representing other civilizations and cultural categories  in addition to those of western Europe      
In other words  the heritage of all people  not just what goes back to the Greeks and Romans  but also the origins of African       Asian       Native American civilizations  Though more inclusive  it s still  basically  a  heritage model        which brings us to a third approach  what I call the  Patterns of Change Model  
Like the Different Cultures Model  this model presents a wide cultural perspective  But  with this model  we re no longer limited by notions of fixed cultural or geo graphical boundaries  So  then  studying world history is not so much a question of how a particular nation or ethnic group developed  but rather it s a look at common themes conflicts       trends that cut across modern day borders of nations or ethnic groups  In my opinion  this is the best way of studying history  to better understand current day trends and conflicts 
For example  let s take the study of the Islamic world  Well  when I first learned about Islamic civilization  it was from the perspective of Europeans  Now  with the Patterns of Change Model  we re looking at the past through a wider lens  So we would be more interested  say  in how interactions with Islamic civilization the religion       art       literature affected cultures in Africa       India       Spain       and so on 
Or       let s take another example  Instead of looking at each cultural group as having a separate  linear development from some ancient origin  in this course we ll be looking for the common themes that go beyond cultural or regional distinctions  So       instead of studying       a particular succession of British kings       or a dynasty of Chinese emperors       in this course  we ll be looking at the broader concepts of monarchy  imperialism       and political transformation

TRACK 90 TRANSCRIPT

Narrator
Listen to part of a Lecture in an environmental science class 

Professor
OK  now let s talk about another environmental concern soil erosion  It s a major problem  all around the world  Sometimes erosion damages soil so severely that the  land can no longer be cultivated and it s just abandoned  That happened in a big way right here in the United States  Some of you have probably read the novel The Grapes of Wrath  And maybe you remember that the story took place in the 1930s  during the time of what was called the Dust Bowl 

Dust Bowl is a term we use to describe an ecological and human disaster that took place in the southern Great Plains region  For nearly eight years  dust and sand blew across the area and covered everything  It was so bad it even made breathing and eating difficult       and farmers could only look on helplessly as their crops were destroyed and the land       and their lives       ruined 

Now  there d always been droughts and strong winds in that region  But that was OK because the native grasses had deep roots in the ground that were able to hold the soil in place  So the wind wasn t able to  you know  erode the soil too badly  This changed  though  between 1900 and 1930  Agriculture was expanding rapidly then  and lots of farmers in the southern Great Plains wanted to grow wheat and other crops they could sell for cash uh  crops that would be profitable  So they ripped up much of the grassland to plant these crops like wheat  which don t hold the soil
down nearly as well  At the same time  livestock uh  cattle  too many of them were feeding on grasses in the area and damaging a lot of the grassland  So these animals caused even more erosion of the soil 
It didn t help that many of the actual owners of the land were not living anywhere near the area a lot of the landowners lived way back east  and rented out the land to local people who lived on the land and worked on it  but  um  didn t have much reason to take really good care of it  I mean  it wasn t their land  right  The tenant farmers weren t really interested in conserving someone else s soil not for the long term  anyway 
Also  some thought the land couldn t really be damaged you know  that the soil was so rich and deep that       it didn t matter if the topsoil  the soil on the surface  blew away  They thought they could just plow up more  But they were wrong  Good top soil takes a long time to form it can literally take thousands of years to create good topsoil that will grow vegetation and a very short time to ruin it  So after only a few years of excessive plowing  the land pretty much couldn t be farmed anymore  And people moved on to other places and let the old areas just sit there  And when they didn t plant anything on that land  that made it vulnerable to even more erosion  So it was kind of a vicious cycle  you could say 
Another problem  ironically  was that advances in technology were actually destroying the land  instead of improving it  A lot of farmers were using huge new tractors that dug deep into the ground and tore up a lot of the soil 
And then  of course  there was the weather  You know  when people look back on the Dust Bowl era  they tend to blame the drought the lack of rain between 1934 and 1937  We can t ignore the drought l mean  it was the worst on record at the time and did help bring on this disaster  But without the soil destruction the drought alone wouldn t have resulted in the devastation we call the Dust Bowl  It was poor farming techniques that made that happen 
Since then  though  we ve paid more attention to trying to prevent a future Dust Bowl  One thing Congress did was enact a massive government effort to improve soil conservation  called the Soil Erosion Act  Under this law  large stretches of land in the southern Great Plains were identified as being at risk for erosion and were taken out of production and turned into permanent grassland  What that did by protecting the land from excessive farming was to stabilize the soil  Also  the Soil Erosion Act helped educate farmers to practice better soil conservation techniques  like reducing how often they plowed and using better equipment that would  you know  minimize damage to the soil structure

Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor 
Student
Excuse me  Ms  Chambers  Um  I don t have an appointment  but l was kinda wondering if you had a minute to help me with something 
Academic advisor
Oh  sure  Have a seat 

What s on your mind 
Student
Well  uh       I guess I really don t know where to start       It s not just one class  It s       I m not doing all that great  Like on my homework assignments  And in class  And I don t know why  I mean  l just don t get it  l l read the assignments and I do the homework and I m still not doing too well      
Academic advisor
Um  which classes  You mean  like Spanish       you re taking Spanish  right 
Student
Oh  no  not Spanish       if it weren t for Spanish I d really be in trouble       no  but it s really all the others  psychology and sociology especially 
Academic advisor
Is it the material  what you read in the textbooks  You don t understand it 
Student
No  that s just it l think I understand stuff when I read it      
Academic advisor
You don t re      
Student
Remember  Well  I remember names and definitions  but       like  in class  when the professor asks us about the theories  what they re all about  I never have the answer 
Academic advisor
Sounds like you re trying to learn by memorizing details  instead of picking out the main points of the reading  So  tall me  how do you study 
Student
Well  l l       l mean  I read the assigned chapters  and I try to underline everything       like all of the words I don t know  and I always memorize the definitions  But  I dunno  when I get back in class  it always seems like the other students ve gotten a better handle on what was in the reading  So  maybe it s just me      
Academic advisor
Oh  it s not  Believe me  Lots of students       You know  my first year as a college student       I really had a hard time  I spent hours reading in the library      but I was just wasting time   cause I wasn t really studying the right things  I did the same sort of thing it sounds like you re doing  not focusing on what s really important in the reading  but on the smaller details 
Student
Yeah  maybe  But I spend so much time studying  it seems like I should be doing better 
Academic advisor
The first year of college can be a little overwhelming  I know  Point is  lots of students have trouble adjusting at first  you know  figuring out how to study  how to use their time  you know  to your best advantage  It s good that you do the assigned readings       but  you ve       well  I think you re unnecessarily underlining and memorizing  That takes a lot of time  and  well  it s not the best use of your time  Here s something you can do  when you read  just read the assigned sections  and then       and without
looking back at the text write a summary of the key points  the main ideas in the chapter  And after you do that  it it s good to go back and reread the text  And you look for any examples you can find to support those key points  Let me show you an example of what I mean 
纸质版TPO5 Lecture3 astronomy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class 

Professor
I II tell you a story about how one astronomy problem was solved  It happened many years ago  but you ll see that it s interesting and still relevant  Two  three hundred years ago  astronomers already had telescopes  but they were not as powerful as those we have now  Let s say       they were at the level of telescopes amateur astronomers use today  Tell me  what do you see in the night sky when you use a telescope like that  Quick  tell me 
Female student
Planets      
Professor
Right      
Male student
Even       like       the moons of Jupiter 
Professor
Right      
Female student
Stars 
Professor
OK       what else        You think that s all        Ever heard of nebulae        I bet you have       Well  let s just  um  put it up anyway      

Nebulae are small fuzzy patches you see in the sky  they look like little clouds  Many of them have a spiral shape  and that s why we called them spiral nebulae       So astronomers in the eighteenth century       eighteenth century       when they looked through the telescope  they could see planets and they knew those were planets      the moons of Jupiter and they knew they were the moons of Jupiter       and then they saw spiral nebulae and they didn t have a clue 
What could those be  So  some of them thought  these things are cloudy and fuzzy  so they re probably small clouds of cosmic dust  and they don t have to be very far away from us   But there were others who thought   OK  the things look small and fuzzy  but maybe they re actually distant galaxies of stars  but we can t see the stars  because they re so far away and they seem so tiny that they look like dust  and even the whole galaxy looks like a tiny little cloud  

Which of the two theories do you think was more       uh  surprising 
Male student
The galaxy one 
Professor
And why 
Male student
Well  I mean it assumed that the nebulae are not what they look like at first sight  The first theory assumed that  right 
Professor
OK  And now tell me this       which one would have seemed more likely at the time 
Male student
Uh       They couldn t tell 
Professor
Right  Two morals here  first  there can be different explanations for the same observation  And second   obvious  doesn t necessarily mean  right        What happened next was       for a long time nothing  More than 150 years  No one could decide       Both hypotheses seemed plausible       And a lot was at stake because if the galaxy theory was right  it would be proof that the universe is enormous       and if the dust theory was right       maybe not so enormous  So the size of the universe was at stake       Finally in the 1920s we came up with a telescope that was strong enough to tell us something new here  When we used it to look at the spiral nebulae  we saw       well  we were not absolutely sure       but it really looked like there were stars in those nebulae  So not dust after all  but stars      

But how far away were they  really  How would you measure that  Any ideas  Laura 
Female student
Well  how about measuring how strong those stars shine  Because  if the star is far away  then its light would be weak  right 
Professor
Yes       but there s a problem here  You need to know how bright the star is in the first place  because some stars are naturally much brighter than others  So  if you see a star that s weak       it can mean one of two things      
Female student
Oh       it s either far away or it s just a weak star 
Professor
And you can t really always tell which  But you re on the right track  There is a kind of star where you can calculate its natural brightness       and you guessed it we found some in the nebulae  It s called a variable star or a  variable  for short because its brightness varies in regular intervals  I won t go into detail here  but       basically       the longer the interval  the brighter the star  so from the length of those intervals we were able to calculate their natural brightness  This told us how distant they were and many turned out to be very  very far away  So we can be sure that the spiral nebulae really are very distant galaxies which is what some eighteenth century astronomers guessed but didn t have the instruments to prove      
Now  one reason I told you this story is that today there are still plenty of situations when we see something out there  but we really aren t sure what it is  An example of one such mysterious observation would be gamma ray bursters 

We ve known about these gamma ray bursters for a long time now  but we can t all agree on what they are

纸质版TPO5 Lecture 4 art history

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 

Professor
Today we re going to talk about how to look at a piece of art  how to  read  it what you should look for       what aspects of it you should evaluate  A lot of people think that if you stand in front of a work of art and gaze at it for a couple of minutes  you re evaluating it  But truly reading a piece of art  evaluating it properly  is a complex process  a process that takes time 
When we re confronted with a piece of art  there re several things we have to keep in mind  for example  its beauty       that s where aesthetics comes in 

Aesthetics is the philosophy that deals with the definition of beauty  which goes all the way back to ancient Greece  They  um  the early Greek philosophers said that beauty and art are based on imitation  Their feeling about art was that it s beautiful when it imitates life  they thought that the truthfulness of an image  how truthful it is to life  determines its value as art  Today we have a broader definition of aesthetics 
Now don t identify aesthetics as personal taste  Taste is bound by time  taste is tied to a society  a given set of moral values  usually  You may not like a piece of art from a different culture it may not be your taste but you appreciate its beauty  cause you recognize certain aesthetic principles  Art generally adheres to certain aesthetic principles like balance  uh  balanced proportions  contrast  movement  or rhythm 

We ll discuss aesthetics more in detail when we look at some pieces of art together  Another thing to keep in mind in evaluating art is that art has a purpose  generally determined by the artist  You may not know what it is  and you don t need to know what it is to appreciate a piece of art  but it helps  For example  if you know what the artist s purpose is       if you know that a piece of art expresses the artist s feeling about a political or social situation  you ll probably look at it differently 
Now  besides beauty and purpose  what are the other aspects of a piece of art that need to be evaluated  Very simple you examine a piece of art following these four formal steps  The first step is description       describe physical characteristics of the piece like this painting is large  it s oil on canvas  Describe the subject it s a person  it s a landscape or predominant colors like  um  earth colors       that s a description 
OK  So  you ve described the piece  The next step is analysis  You re looking at the piece for any universal symbols  characters  or themes it might contain  Certain symbols are universal  and the artist counts on your understanding of symbols  Even colors have symbolic significance  as you may know  And also objects depicted in a piece of art are often used to represent an abstract idea  Like wheels or spheres they look like circles  right  so wheels and spheres represent wholeness and continuity  I have a handout  a list of these symbols and images and their interpretations  that I ll give you later  But for now  the point is that after you describe the piece of art  you analyze its content       you determine whether it contains elements that the artist is using to try to convey a certain meaning 
If it does  the next step is interpretation  Interpretation follows analysis very closely  You try to interpret the meaning of the symbols you identified in the piece  Almost all art has an obvious and an implied meaning  The implied meaning is hidden in the symbolic system expressed in the piece of art  What we see depicted is one scene  but there can be several levels of meaning  Your interpretation of these symbols makes clear what the artist is trying to tell us 
The last step is judgment or opinion what do you think of the piece  is it powerful or boring   but I give that hardly any weight  If the four steps were to be divided up into a chart  then description  analysis  and interpretation would take up 99 percent  Your opinion is not important in understanding a piece of art  It s nice to say  I like it       I wouldn t mind hanging it over my couch  but to evaluate a piece of art  it s not critical 
OK  Now you know what I mean by  reading  a piece of art  and what it entails  Try to keep all that in mind next time you go to an art museum  I can tell you right now that you probably won t be able to look at more than 12 pieces of art during that visit 
OK  now let s look at a slide of a piece of art and try to  read  it together
