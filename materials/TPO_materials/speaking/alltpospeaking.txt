Task 3
Letter in the Centerville College News
The administration has announced plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus  We
should all oppose this plan  The university s poor financial condition led it to increase
the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year  Surely then it is in no
financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture  Moreover  just look at the
sculpture  several 60 foot long steel plates  jutting out of the earth at odd angles  It s
so large  it ll take up all the green space in front of the campus center  This is public
space that should be reserved for students to use 
Question  Explain why the woman disagrees with the reasons expressed in the letter

Task 4
Groupthink
One process by which groups may make bad or irrational decisions is known as
groupthink  Individual members of a group attempt to conform their opinions to what
they believe to be the group consensus even though the result may be negative  There
are many reasons why groupthink happens  These include the desire to be liked  fear
of losing a job  or even not wanting to be the one employee delaying a decision that
seems inevitable  These kinds of implicit pressures to conform lead group members to
ultimately make decisions that each  by himself or herself  might normally not make 
Question  Explain groupthink and its effects using the example of the computer
company

a deeper understanding of that area  Which approach to course selection do you think
is better for students and why 

Task 3
Bus Service Elimination Planned
The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students  The reason
given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses are expensive
to operate  Currently  the buses run from the center of campus past university
buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus  The
money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded
student parking lots

Task 4
Social interaction
People deal with each other every day  This interaction is at the heart of social life 
The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one
another s behavior  People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in
fact  the very presence of others can affect behavior  For example  one principle of
social interaction  audience effects  suggests that individuals  work is affected by their
knowledge that they are visible to others  that the presence of others tends to alter the
way people behave or perform an activity 
Question  Explain how the examples of tying shoes and learning to type demonstrate
the principle of audience effects

Hot Breakfast Eliminated
Beginning next month  Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at
university dining halls  Instead  Students will be offered a wide assortment of cold
breakfast items in the morning  These cold breakfast foods  such as breads  fruit  and
yogurt  are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving  So 
health conscious students should welcome this change  Students will benefit in
another way as well  because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will
save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable 
Question  The woman expressed her opinion of the change that has been announced 
State her opinion and explain her reasons for holding that opinion

Task 4
Cognitive dissonance
Individuals sometimes experience a contradiction between their actions and their
beliefs   between what they are doing and what they believe they should be doing 
These contradictions can cause a kind of mental discomfort known as cognitive
dissonance  People experiencing cognitive dissonance often do not want to change the
way they are acting  so they resolve the contradictory situation in another way  They
change their interpretation of the situation in a way that minimizes the contradiction
between what they are doing and what they believe should be doing 
Question  Using the example discussed by the professor  explain what cognitive
dissonance is and how people often deal with it 

Task 5
Question  The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman s problem

Task 3
Evening Computer Classes May Be Added
The computer department is considering offering evening classes in the fall  The
proposal to add the classes is a response to student complaints that daytime computer
classes have become increasingly overcrowded and there are no longer enough
computers available  The department has decided that despite some added expense 
the most cost effective way of addressing this problem is by adding computer classes
in the evening  It is hoped that this change will decrease the number of students
enrolled in day classes and thus guarantee individual access to computers for all
students in computer classes 
Question  The computer department is considering a scheduling change  Explain the
man s opinion of the change and reasons he gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Verbal and Nonverbal Communication
When we speak with other people face to face the nonverbal signals we give   our
facial expressions  hand gestures  body movements  and tone of voice   often

10

?



communicate as much as  or more than  the words we utter  When our nonverbal
signals  which we often produce unconsciously  agree with our verbal message  the
verbal message is enhanced and supported  made more convincing  But when they
conflict with the verbal message  we may be communicating an entirely different and
more accurate message than what we intend 
Question  Explain how the examples from the professor s lecture illustrate the
relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication 

Task 5
Question  The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the man s problem  Briefly

Campus Dining Club Announced
Starting this year  the university dining hall will be transformed into the Campus
Dining Club for one week at the end of each semester  During the last week of each
semester  the dining hall will feature special meals prepared by the university s
culinary arts students  The school feels that this will give students who are studying

pursue careers  The university has announced that it will charge a small additional fee
for these dinners in order to pay for the special gourmet food ingredients that will be
required 
Question  The man expresses his opinion about the university s plan  State his
opinion and explain the reason he gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Target Marketing
Advertisers in the past have used radio and television in an attempt to provide
information about their products to large  general audiences  it was once thought that

12

?



the best way to sell a product was to advertise it to as many people as possible 
However  more recent trends in advertising have turned toward target marketing 
Target marketing is the strategy of advertising to smaller  very specific
audiences   audiences that have been determined to have the greatest need or desire
the product being marketed  Target marketing has proved to be very effective in
reaching potential customers 
Question  Using the professor s examples  explain the advertising technique of target
marketing

Task 3
History Seminars Should Be Shorter
Currently  all of the seminar classes in the history department are three hours long  I
would like to propose that history seminars be shortened to two hours  I make this
proposal for two reasons  First  most students just cannot concentrate for three hours
straight  I myself have taken these three hour seminars and found them tiring and
sometimes boring  Also  when a seminar lasts that long  people stop concentrating and
stop learning  so the third hour of a three hour seminar is a waste of everyone s time 
Two hour seminars would be much more efficient 
Question  The woman expresses her opinion about the proposal that her friend Tim
made in his letter to the newspaper  State her opinion about his proposal and explain
the reasons she gives for her opinion 

Task 4
Explicit Memories and Implicit Memories
In everyday life  when people speak of memory  they are almost always speaking
what psychologists would call explicit memories  An explicit memory is a conscious

14

?



intentional recollection  usually of facts  names  event  or other things that a person
state or declare  There is another kind of memory that is not conscious  Memory of
kind are called implicit memories  An individual can have an experience that he or
cannot consciously recall yet still display reactions that indicate the experience has
been somehow recorded in his or her brain 
Question  Using the example of the car advertisement  explain what is meant by
implicit memory

Task 3
Sculpture Courses to Be Discontinued
University administrators announce yesterday that the sculpture program  a division
of the art department  will be eliminated   The main reason is a lack of student
interest   reported one administrator   Although the number of art students has
increased  fewer and fewer art majors are taking sculpture classes   Furthermore  the
department s only sculpture professor is retiring this year   Given the art department s
limited budget   the administrator explained   it just doesn t make sense to hire a new
full time professor to teach sculpture for only a handful of students  
Question  The woman expresses her opinion about the university s plan  State her
opinion about and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Behavior Modification
Individuals often modify their behaviors based on what they have learned about the
possible consequences of their actions  When an individual learns through experience

16

?



that a certain behavior results in pleasant consequences  that behavior is likely to be
repeated  An unpleasant consequence  on the other hand  discourages further
of the behavior  While behavior modification can be observed in experiments  it also
occurs frequently in everyday settings  when individuals change their behavior based
on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior 
Question  Using the example from the lecture  explain what behavior modification is
and how it works 

Task 5
Question  The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the woman s problem

Music Coming to Cafeterias
Mary Dixon  Director of the Student Life Committee  announced yesterday that
beginning next semester university cafeterias will broadcast classical music during
mealtimes   Music will foster a more relaxed atmosphere   said Dixon   Students 
lives are hectic  and mealtimes provide important opportunities to take a break and
catch up with friends before moving on to the next class or assignment   Added
Dixon   We re also hoping that  if we provide the music  students will unplug their
personal music devices   their walkmans and mp3 players of whatever   and will
spend more time talking to each other  When students have their headphones on 
they re not connecting with each other   
Question  The man expresses his opinion about his opinion of the university s plan 
State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Revealing Coloration
Many animals use coloration to protect themselves from predators  One defensive
strategy involving the use of coloration is what is known as reveling coloration 

18

?



Animals employing this strategy have an area of bright color on some part of their
this bright color is usually hidden from predators  view  When approached by a
predator  the animal suddenly reveals the area of bright color  this unexpected display
of color startles or confuses the predator and provides the would be prey with an
opportunity to escape

agree with  Explain why 

Task 3
Required Work Experience
The business studies department at State University will now require all students
enrolled in its program to complete one semester of work experience in a local
corporation or small business  It is felt that students will benefit from this work
experience by developing leadership and organizational skills that would not normally
be learned in a classroom or campus setting  Furthermore  the relationship that
students establish with the company that they work for may help them to secure
permanent employment with that company once they have completed the program
and graduated 
Question  The woman expresses her opinion of the university s new policy  State her
opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
The Establishing Shot
Film directors use different types of camera shots for specific purposes  An
shot is an image shown briefly at the beginning of a scene  usually taken from far
That is used to provide context for the rest of the scene  One purpose of the
20

?



shot is to communicate back ground information to the viewer  such as
and when the rest of the scene will occur  It also establishes the mood feeling of the
scene  Due to the context that the establishing shot provides  the characters and events
that are shown next are better understood by the viewer

Task 3
Student Art Display
The university is currently considering possible locations on campus for displaying
paintings and other artwork by students  I think the lobby at the entrance to the
student center would be a great location  Since many students pass through the
Student center every day  artwork displayed in the lobby would be viewed by
hundreds of people  Also  because the whole front of the building is made of glass
window  the lobby is filled with natural light  This makes it perfect for displaying
artwork  which should have plenty of light to be seen and appreciated 
Sincerely yours  Paul Sands 
Question  Briefly summarize the proposal in the student s letter  Then state her
opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Entertainment Merchandising
An effective  widely used marketing practice in the entertainment industry is
entertainment merchandising  Entertainment merchandising is a form of marketing in

22

?



which the brand or image from one product is also used to sell another  The practice
entertainment merchandising often occurs in connection with movies and television
shows  especially those associated with children  For example  the success of a
children s television show may result in the marketing of toys that are designed to
like characters in the show  Or the situation may be reversed when a children s
television show is written to include characters that are based on already popular toys 
Question  Using the example from the lecture  explain the concept of entertainment
merchandising

dormitories has decreased by twenty percent  In an effort to counteract the trend  the
college has announced a plan to renovate its on campus housing  The renovations will
take two years  and they will include improvements to the bathrooms  lighting  and
heating in the dormitories   A lot of people are moving off campus because the dorms
aren t in great shape   explained the college president   By renovating the dorms  we
can make them more appealing than off campus housing  and more students will
choose to remain on campus  
Question  The woman expresses her opinion about the university s plan  Then state
her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Outsider Art
Outsider Art is a term used to describe art that is made by people who choose to live
work outside society  The artists who produce this kind of art Outsider Artists  work

24

?



isolation from other artists and have little or no formal artistic training  Because they
not learn conventional artistic techniques from teachers or other artists  outsider artists
must invent their own ways of doing things  As a result of the unconventional
that outsider artists often use  their work can look strange and not at all like traditional
art to the observer

Task 3
College Radio Station to Undergo Major Changes 
The university is considering making major changes to the college radio station 
Changes would include an expansion of the station s broadcasting range  which
would allow the radio s programming to reach nearby towns  One goal of the plan is
to attract more students to apply to its communications program  Another goal is
provide the university with an extra source of revenue  University officials expect the
enhanced radio station to significantly increase the number of listeners  which will in
turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio 
Question  The woman supports the proposal described in the article  Explain why she
thinks it will achieve the university s goals 

Task 4
Subliminal Perception
Humans are constantly perceiving visual and auditory stimuli  Sometimes our
perception of these stimuli occurs consciously  we are aware of a stimulus and know

26

?



what we are perceiving it  But our perception of a stimulus can also occur without our
awareness  an image might appear and disappear before our eyes too quickly for us to
notice what we saw it  or a sound might be too faint for us to realize that we heard it 
This phenomenon   the perception of a stimulus just below the threshold of conscious
awareness   is called subliminal perception  Experiments have shown that
perceived stimuli can influence people s thoughts and attitudes 
Question  Describe what subliminal perception is and explain how the experiment
discussed by the professor illustrates this phenomenon

stadium  commenting that a new stadium would help the university achieve its goal of
attracting more top students  The official also said that  additionally  building a new
stadium would allow the university to strengthen its relationship with the town since a
new and larger stadium would have the space to seat not only students  parent  and
alumni  but members of the local community as well 
Question  The woman expresses her opinion about the university s plan  Then state
her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Perceptual Constancy
How an object affects our senses depends in part on external conditions  and these
conditions are always changing  An object viewed from one angle presents a different

28

?



shape to our eye than when viewed from another angle  similarly  as the distance from
which we view an object changes  the object will appear larger or smaller  In spite of
this  even as conditions change and we see objects differently  we still recognize that
they remain the same  This is what is known as perceptual constancy  If not of
perceptual constancy  we might have difficulty recognizing familiar objects if we
viewed them in a new and different context 
Question  Explain what is meant by  Perceptual constancy   using the examples
provided by the professor

Task 3
University Should Allow Eating in Class
Currently  there is a university wide policy that prohibits eating in the classroom  I
disagree with this policy  I think students should be allowed to eat in class  This
change would be good for two reasons  For one thing  students were permitted to eat 
they would be able to concentrate better  because students often get hungry during
long classes  and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate  Also  if food were allowed
in classrooms  it would be possible for us to have in class parties on the last day of
class   with snack foods and beverages   to celebrate the end of each semester 
Question  The man expresses her opinion about the proposal in the newspaper 
Briefly summarize the proposal  Then state her opinion and explain the reasons she
gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Comfort Zone Bias
Psychologists have found that when people make important decision  they often
to stay in their  Comfort Zone   that is  they prefer remaining in comfortable  familiar
situations  rather than entering into new  unfamiliar ones  This tendency is often
referred to as the comfort zone bias  When people are reasonably content  they often

30

?



decide not to pursue a new opportunity  even if it attracts them and offers more
advantages  Psychologists believe that the comfort zone bias exists not only because
have a natural preference for what we already know  but also because we want to
taking risks 
Question  Using the example from the lecture  explain the comfort zone bias 

Task 5
Question  Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing  Then state

Task 3
University Should Pave Running Trails
The university has about three miles of unpaved dirt running trails that pass through
the forest near campus  I think these trails should be paved with cement  One reason
for paving the trails would be to increase their safety  When it rains  the dirt turns to
mud and becomes very slippery  so the runners who use them can slip and fall 
Pavement would solve this problem  Also  paving would make the trails look nicer 
which would encourage students to use them  Bumps in the trial would be smoothed
out and weeds would be paved over  making the trail more attractive to runners 
Sincerely Sally Jacobs
Question  The man expresses his opinion about the proposal in the student s letter 
Briefly summarize the proposal  Then state her opinion about the proposal and
explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion 

Task 4
Experiment Effect
One objective of any experiment is  of course  to obtain accurate results  Sometimes 
however  problems occur that lead to inaccurate results  One such problem is the

32

?



experimenter effect  The experimenter effect occurs when a researcher s expectations
affect the outcome of the experiment  The researcher expects a particular result from
the experiment  and expectation causes the researcher to act in ways that influence the
behavior of the experiment participants  thereby invalidating the result of the
experiment 
Question  Explain how the example from the professor s lecture illustrate the
experiment effect 

Task 5

Task 3
Student Health Services Need Improvement
The situation at the health center is unacceptable  you sit in a crowded waiting room
for hours waiting to get treatment for minor ailments  Then when it s your turn  you
get about three minutes with an overworked doctor  I have two suggestions  First  the
health center needs to hire more doctors so that each patient receives quality treatment 
And as far as the wait time issue is concerned  the health center is currently open only
Monday through Fridays  which means that people who get sick over the weekend
wait until the following week to get treatment  So  opening the health center on
weekends should solve that problem too 
Question  The man expresses her opinion about the student s suggestions that are
made in the letter  Then state his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding
that opinion 

Task 4
Social loafing
When people work in groups to perform a task  individual group members may feel
motivated to contribute  since no one person is held directly responsible for
the task  The result is that people may not work as hard  or accomplish as much  as

34

?



would if they were working alone and their individual output were being measured 
This decrease in personal efforts  especially on a simple group task  is known as
loafing  While it is not a deliberate behavior  the consequence of social loafing is less
personal efficiency when working in groups than when working on one s own 
Question  Using the example from the lecture  explain what social loafing is and how
it affects people s behavior 

Task 5
Question  The students discuss two possible solutions to the man s problem  Briefly

Task 3
New Library Workspaces
Say good bye to the big  multiperson study tables in Turner Library  This summer  the
tables will be exchanged for new personal study cubicles   small  one person desks
enclosed by walls  These new units will allow students to have privacy and work in
isolation and will therefore eliminate noise in the library so students can concentrate 
Additionally  the cubicles will enable the library to accommodate the recent increase
in the number of students attending our university  Although the current tables seat
six students each  they make poor use of the available floor space  The cubicles  on

therefore add 50 new seats

Ritualization
Sociobiologists believe that some communicative behavior in animals is developed
through a process called ritualization  In this process  the purpose of a give behavior

?



changes over time   a behavior that originally had a practical purpose develops into
that communicates a specific message  For example  a certain movement or physical
feature might evolve to serve as a signal or a warning that other animals will
Once a behavior is ritualized  it becomes a form of communication  therefore  if an
animal engages in this behavior  other animals will be able to interpret the meaning of
the behavior quickly and respond appropriately

Relict Behavior
In general  animals act in ways that help them to survive within their specific habitats 
However  sometimes an animal species may display a behavior that no longer serves a

clear purpose  The original purpose for the behavior may have disappeared long ago 
even thousands of years before  These behaviors  known as relict behaviors  were
useful to the animal when the species  habitat was different  but now  because of
changed conditions  the behavior no longer serves its original purpose  Left over from
an earlier time  the behavior remains as relict  or remnant  long after the
circumstance that influenced its evolution has vanished

Task 4
Questioning Awareness of Effect
When a student engages in disruptive behavior in the classroom  it negatively impacts
both the teacher s ability to teach and other students  ability to learn  One way a

can correct disruptive behavior is by questioning awareness to effect  With this
technique  when a student disrupts the class  the teacher asks the student a question
draws attention to the negative effect of the student s behavior  The teacher then does
not wait for an answer  but immediately continues teaching  By thus simply drawing
attention to effect of the student s behavior  the teacher can often lead the student to
discontinue the behavior

Epiphytes
In rain forests  the canopy produced by the upper layer of branches may be so dense
that few plants can grow on the shady ground below  Even so  many plants have
adapted to life in the rain forests  developing many strategies for survival  For
example  various species known as epiphytes use a host plant as a platform for growth 
Although epiphytes grow on a host tree  they take no nutrients from the tree itself 
Attached to the tree  sometimes 30 or 40 meters high  these aerial plants have access
to sunlight but not to nutrients from the soil below  As a result  they have developed
unusual mechanisms that have allowed them to overcome this problem

textbooks  students will save money in the long run since purchasing the electronic
books for their classes is much less expensive than buying regular textbooks 
Furthermore  the university believes the device will be an effective study aid because
it is simple to operate and offers features such as highlighting of the text and
note taking

Swarm intelligence
Some insect species live in large groups or  swarms   Such swarms typically include
several thousand individual insects  Living in swarms allows these insects to

individual group members  This complex group behavior is called as swarm
intelligence  With swarm intelligence  each insect performs a simple instinctual
behavior that is repeated by other individuals that results in a complex behavior 
Insect swarms are able to accomplish tasks that individual insects would not be able

Refute and Persuade
Sometimes companies realize that consumers have developed a negative impression

disadvantage  But then the company refutes or challenges that disadvantage by
demonstrating how the advantage of buying and using the product makes up for any
limitation it may have  In this way  companies can persuade consumers to purchase a
product despite its drawbacks

It s great that the university has a program where students can borrow bicycles from
the gym  However  two changes would make the program more convenient  First  the
borrowing period should be shortened to four hours maximum so that more bikes
would be available when students want to borrow them  Second  currently  students
who borrow bikes have to leave a cash deposit  which is returned to them when they
return the bikes  but I think students should be required to leave their student
identification cards instead  so they don t have to remember to bring cash

Question  The man expresses his opinion about the proposal described in the letter 
Briefly summarize the proposal then state his opinion about the proposal and explain
the reasons he gives for holding that opinion 

Task4 
Carrying Capacity
An animal species needs to have enough resources  like food and water  to survive in
any given environment  However  because resources are limited  only a certain
number of animals of a particular species are able to survive in a given habitat  The
greatest number a habitat can support is known as the carrying capacity  If nothing
happens to disrupt or unbalance the relationship between the animal and its habitat 
the carrying capacity will remain stable  However  a carrying capacity is not fixed  If
there is a significant disruption  such as an environmental event that alters the
amount of available resources in the habitat  the carrying capacity will change 
Question  Explain the concept of carrying capacity using the example of the moth and
Ragwort

Task 3
Narrator
Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter 
Student A 
Did you see Paul s letter in the paper about the new sculpture 
Student B 
Yeah  but it was totally unconvincing  His reasons for opposing the plan were just
totally off  I m glad we ll finally have some nice art on campus  I d like to shake the
donor s hand and say  Thank you  
Student A 
What do you mean   The donor  
Student B 
You didn t know  An anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculpture 
Student A 
Not the university 
Student B 
No  His assumptions about who s paying for it are all wrong 
Student A 
Still  I wonder if he has a point about the space it ll take up 
Student B 
Well  you know why Paul is upset  He and his friends are always out there on the
lawn  right where the sculpture will be  kicking around the soccer ball  Now they ll
just have to use another part of the campus to play 
Student A 
Oh  so  he just doesn t want to have to move 
Student B 
Yeah  For him  it s sculpture versus convenience

Task 4

Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a business management class 
Professor 
So let me tell you about my own experience with this when I was working for a
computer company a couple of years ago  So one day  a coworker and I suggested we
should give our computers a design makeover  make them look more up to date 
Market research was showing that new customers said they would be more interested
in buying our computers if they looked cooler  Our technology was advanced  but the
outside design looked really old fashioned 
At first  more than half the group supported us  There were a few senior managers
there though who didn t support the design change  One of the senior managers said 
 Our focus has always been on technology  Changing the look is an unnecessary

71

?



cost   Almost immediately  some of our supporters changed their minds  Even my
coworker changed his mind  When I asked him why after the meeting  he told me he
didn t want to make a bad impression on the senior managers  He thought that
disagreeing with them might jeopardize his chances of getting a promotion by not
looking like a team player 
What about me  I hate to admit it  but after a few hours of discussion  I started
wondering if it was worth everyone s time to argue about this  As more people sided
with senior management  I started to feel like I was the only one holding up the vote 
Everyone else seemed to think change wasn t necessary  so I voted against my own
idea in the end  So we unanimously decided to stay with the current old looking
design  But this decision ended up costing us a lot of money  That same year  our
competitor came out with a new design that attracted some of our customers and
prevented us from profiting on potential new customers 

Task 5
Narrator 
Now listen to a conversation between two students 
Student A 
Hey  Mary  How s your volunteer work going  You still involved in that after school
program with the elementary school kids 
Student B 
Yeah  But I ve got a problem  I m supposed to be driving a bunch of them to the zoo
tomorrow 
Student A 
Yeah 
Student B 
And I was supposed to rent a van for the trip  But I waited too long to call the rental
agency to reserve one  And now it turns out they don t have any vans available for
tomorrow  I don t know what to do  These kids will be really disappointed if their trip
gets cancelled 
Student A 
Um   well  doesn t one of your friends here on campus have a car  I mean  couldn t
you borrow it for the day 
Student B 
Yeah  probably  but I d need to borrow two cars or there wouldn t be enough space for
all the kids 
Student A 
Uh huh 
Student B 
That s why I was going to rent the van  And then I need to find somebody else to
drive too  I can t drive two cars by myself 
Student A 
 Chuckles  Yeah  that s true  Well  I m sure you can probably find a volunteer  or if
you wanted to save yourself the trouble of hunting down the second driver  well   
what about public transportation  Check the bus schedule  I   I think there s a bus line
that goes right past the zoo 
Student B 

72

?



Yeah  That s a possibility  But   I don t know  It might be a real  challenge  
supervising the kids on the bus 
Student A 
 Chuckles 
Student B 
Sometimes they are a handful when they get excited  It s an option  though 

Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class  The professor is discussing the
mathematical capabilities of babies 
Professor 
Scientists have learned some interesting things about the intellectual abilities of
babies  They say there is evidence that babies as young as five months old can do
basic arithmetic   that they can add  Scientists think babies know that one plus one
equals two  and not one  The evidence is indirect because obviously  you can t ask a
five month old baby to add up some numbers for you 
So they devised an experiment where    err in this experiment  a baby is shown a doll
on a table  OK  so the baby looks at the doll  Then the researcher lowers a screen in
front of the doll  so now the doll is hidden behind the screen  But the baby s already
seen the doll and so knows it s there 
Well then the researcher takes a second doll and very obviously places it behind the
screen with the first one  OK  so now you have two dolls behind the screen  right 
Well  no  cuz what the researchers did was they secretly took away one of the dolls 
And then when they raised the screen back up  the baby  well  it expects to see two
dolls right  But there is only one there  And guess what  The baby s surprised  It
expects two but it only sees one 
How could the researchers tell that the baby s surprised  Well they recorded the
baby s eye movements on camera  And we know that when a baby is surprised by
something  a loud noise  or an unexpected flash of light maybe  it stares at where the
noise or light is coming from  And that s what the babies in the experiment did   they
stared   cuz a baby knows that if you add one doll and one doll  you should have two
dolls  So when it sees one doll  then it stares because it s surprised

Narrator
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
I don t like the university s plan 
Student B 
Really  I ve ridden those buses  and sometimes there were only a few people on the
bus  It did seem like kind of a waste 
Student A 
I see your point  But I think the problem is the route s out of date  It only goes
through the neighborhoods that ve gotten too expensive for students to live in  It s
ridiculous that they haven t already changed the route you know  so it goes where
most off campus students live now  I bet if they did that  they d get plenty of students
riding those buses 
Student B 
Well  at least they re adding more parking  It s gotten really tough to find a space 
Student A 
That s the other part I don t like  actually  Cutting back the bus service and adding
parking s just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus  And that ll just add
to the noise around campus and create more traffic       and that ll increase the need
for more parking spaces      
Student B 
Yeah  I guess I can see your point  Maybe it would be better if more students used the
buses instead of driving 
Student A 
Right  And the university should make it easier to do that  not harder 

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a talk in a sociology class  The professor is discussing audience
effects 
Professor 
OK  so we said that the way we interact with others has an impact on our behavior  In
fact  there s some interesting research to suggest that in one type of
interaction when we re being observed specifically  when we know we re being
watched as we perform some activity we tend to increase the speed at which we
perform that activity 
In one study  college students were asked to each put on a pair of shoes shoes with
laces they would have to tie  Now one group of students was told that they would be
observed  The second group  however  didn t know they were being observed  The
students who were aware that they were being watched actually tied their shoes much

74

?



faster than the students who thought they were alone  Other studies confirm the same
is true even when we re learning new activities 
Let s say someone is learning a new task for example  learning how to type  When
they re conscious of being observed  they ll likely begin typing at a much faster rate
than they would if they were alone  But  and this is interesting  the study also showed
that certain common behavior  things people typically do  like       making mistakes
when you re learning something new that behavior pattern will also increase  So in
other words  when we re learning to type  and we know we re being watched  we ll
type faster but we ll also make more mistakes 

Task 5
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a Student and her geology professor 
Professor 
Mary  I m so glad I ran into you 
Student 
Oh hello  Professor Jensen 
Professor 
Listen  I know it s a short notice       and maybe you ve already made plans for spring
break       but       one of my students just dropped out of the field trip to the Smithson
River Caves  You re next on the waiting list  so now there s room for you to come
along 
Student 
You re kidding   disappointed  I didn t think there was a chance       and       well  it s
a three day trip  right  I agreed to spend next week helping Professor Clark set up the
new museum exhibition  I think she s really counting on me 
Professor 
Yeah  three days  But you know       if you d rather come on the field trip  why not
speak with her and see if she has anyone to replace you 
Student 
Yeah  I d hate to miss out on the caves  I ll definitely ask Professor Clark if there s
someone else who could help her 
Professor 
You know  We don t leave until Wednesday  If you still have to help out  any chance
you could get the museum setup done before then 
Student 
Oh yeah       not until Wednesday       so then yeah       maybe that s possible too 

Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to a part of a talk in an economics class 
Professor 
So  let s talk about money  What is money  Well  typically people think of coins and
paper  bills  as money       but that s using a somewhat narrow definition of the term 

75

?



A broad definition is this   slowly  money is anything that people can use to make
purchases with  Since many things can be used to make purchases  money can have
many different forms  Certainly  coins and bills are one form of money  People
exchange goods and services for coins or paper bills  and they use this money  these
bills       to obtain other goods and services  For example  you might give a taxi driver
five dollars to purchase a ride in his taxi  And he in turn gives the five dollars to a
farmer to buy some vegetables  But  as I said  coins and bills aren t the only form of
money under this broad definition  Some societies make use of a barter system 
Basically  in a barter system people exchange goods and services directly for other
goods and services  The taxi driver  for example  might give a ride to a farmer in
exchange for some vegetables  Since the vegetables are used to pay for a service  by
our broad definition the vegetables are used in barter as a form of money 
Now  as I mentioned  there s also a second     a narrower definition of money  In the
United States only coins and bills are legal tender meaning that by law  a seller must
accept them as payment  The taxi driver must accept coins or bills as payment for a
taxi ride  OK  But in the U S   the taxi driver is not required to accept vegetables in
exchange for a ride  So a narrower definition of money might be whatever is legal
tender in a society  whatever has to be accepted as payment

Student A 
Do you believe any of this  It s ridiculous 
Student B 
What do you mean  Well it s important to eat healthy foods 
Student A 
Sure it is  but they are saying yogurt s better for you than an omelet or than hot cereal 
I mean whether something is hot or cold  that shouldn t be the issue  except maybe on
a really cold morning  In that case which is going to be better for you  a bowl of cold
cereal or a nice warm omelet  It s obvious  there s no question 
Student B 

76

?



Uh I m not gonna argue with you there 
Student A 
And this whole thing about saving money 
Student B 
What about it 
Student A 
Well  they are actually going to make things worse for us  not better   cuz if they start
cutting back and we can t get what we want right here on campus  well we are going
to be going off campus and pay off campus prices  And you know what  That ll be
expensive  Even if it s only two or three mornings a week  it can add up 

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture about this topic in a sociology class 
Professor
This is a true story  from my own life  In my first year in high school  I was addicted
to video games  I played them all the time and I wasn t studying enough  I was failing
chemistry  That was my hardest class  So this was a conflict for me  because I wanted
a good job when I grew up  and I believed  I knew  that if you want a good career  you
got to do well in school  But I just couldn t give up video games  I was completely
torn 
And my solution was to   to change my perspective  See  the only class I was doing
really badly in was chemistry  In the others  I was   l was ok  So I asked myself  if I
wanted to be a chemist when I grew up  and the fact is I didn t  I was pretty sure I
wanted to be a sociologist  so I told myself my chemistry class didn t matter  because
sociologists don t really need to know chemistry  In other words  I changed my
understanding of what it meant to do well in school  I reinterpreted my situation  I
used to think that doing well in school meant doing well in all my classes  But now I
decided that succeeding in school meant only doing well in the classes that related
directly to my future career  I eliminated the conflict  at least in my mind 

Task 5

Hey  Mary  What s wrong

Institute for a story I wrote  And   
Student A 
That doesn t sound like anything s wrong 
Student B 
Well  it s a huge honor to win  and there s an award ceremony they ve invited me to
attend  which I m so excited about  but   and here s what s frustrating  I ve got a
biology exam that s scheduled for the same time 
Student A 
Uh oh  Well  have you talked to your professor about this  6
77

?



Student B 
Yeah  she said I could write a five page paper instead  And I ve lots of ideas and
know I could do a good job  But      
Student A 
But what 
Student B 
Well  writing a paper would take up so much time  a lot more time than studying for
and taking the exam  I ve lots of other schoolwork to deal with 
Student A 
Oh  Or  you could have someone else receive the award for you  I mean  go in your
place and accept it on your behalf 
Student B 
Maybe    I d still get the award and the money that way 
Student A 
Ooh    You won money too 
Student B 
Yeah  pretty cool  huh  But anyways  my parents were really looking forward to
coming and seeing me on stage  shaking hands with the Institute s president and all 
I d hate to disappoint them 
Student A 
Urn   true    I m sure they re really proud 
Student B 
Like I said  I m still struggling about what to do
Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class  The professor is discussing
advertising strategies 
Professor 
In advertising  urn   various strategies are used to persuade people to buy products  In
order to sell more products  advertisers will often try to make us believe that a product
will meet our needs or desires perfectly  even if it s not true  The strategies they use
can be subtle  uh   friendly forms of persuasion that are sometimes hard to recognize 
In a lot of ads  repetition is a key strategy  Research shows that repeated exposure to a
message  even something meaningless or untrue  is enough to make people accept it
or see it in a positive light  You ve all seen the car commercials on TV  like the one
that refers to its roomy cars over and over again  You know which one I mean  This
guy is driving around and he keeps stopping to pick up different people  He picks up
three or four people  and each time the narrator says  plenty of room for friends 
plenty of room for family  plenty of room for everybody   The same message is
repeated several times in the course of the commercial  Now the car   er   the car
actually looks kind of small  It s not a very big car at all  but you get the sense that it s
pretty spacious  You think that the viewer would reach the logical conclusion that the
slogan    er    misrepresents the product  Instead  what usually happens is that when
the statement  plenty of room  is repeated often enough  people are actually
convinced it s true 

78

?



Um  another strategy they use is to get a celebrity to advertise a product  It turns out
that we are more likely to accept an advertising claim made by somebody famous  a
person we admire and find appealing  We tend to think they are trustworthy 
So   um   you might have a car commercial that features a well known race car driver 
Now it may not be a very fast car  er   it could even be an inexpensive vehicle with a
low performance rating  but if a popular race car driver is shown driving it  and saying
 I like my cars fast   then people will believe the car is impressive for its speed

Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A

Student B

Student A 
Because it s not gonna solve the problem  Students are busy at night  I mean  we have
jobs  families  clubs  social events    Most of us already have something to do every
single night of the week 
Student B 
I see your point  I sure couldn t fit anything into my schedule during the week  I ve
got swimming practice most nights 
Student A 
Right  and as far as expense goes  I think they are going about it the wrong way  I
mean  it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later 
which is a lot more expensive than just simply buying more computers 
Student B 
More computers 
Student A 
That s right  Computer prices have come way down the past few years  So the
department won t have to spend as much now as they did in the past  Besides  the
computer department classrooms  you know  the rooms themselves  they are actually
very big  There s plenty of space to add more computers

Professor
Last month my favorite uncle paid me a surprise visit  I hadn t seen him for many
years  The doorbell rang  I opened the door and there was Uncle Pete  Now I am sure
when I saw him  I said something like  Uncle Pete  what a surprise  How nice to see
you   Anyway  my wife was standing next to me  and according to her  I wasn t
really aware of this  my eyes got really wide and I broke into a huge big smile  She
said I was actually jumping up and down like a little boy  Well  anyway  later that
evening Uncle Pete told me how very very good he felt when he saw how happy I was
to see him 
But compare that with this  my daughter  she is six  We were building a birdhouse
together last week  And I was showing her how to use a hammer and nail  And of
course  stupid me  I wasn t being very careful and I smashed my thumb with the
hammer  Boy did it hurt  I almost felt like screaming  but I didn t want to upset my
daughter  so I said   Don t worry  honey  it s nothing   Meanwhile  I was shaking my
hand as if that would stop my thumb from hurting  and my face was contorted in pain 
My voice was trembling too  So even though I told my daughter I was okay  I m sure
she didn t believe me because she kept asking me if I was okay

There is a computer for student use in the student center  You can go over there  look
it up and check the room number  But   you d have to hurry 
Student A 
Hm     that s not a bad idea  I could check my schedule for the whole rest of the day at

lecture hall  There re only three lecture halls in the building  one on every floor  Just
check each floor till you find yours  There is an elevator  so you should be able to
move fast 
Student A 
Yeah  but I don t know what the professor looks like or anything  How will I know
whether it s my class or not  It d be sort of embarrassing  sticking my head into each
lecture hall  asking if I was in the right place 
Student B 
Well    you might luck out and find it the first time 
Task 6
Narrator
Listen to part of a talk in an art appreciation class 
Professor
In order for art to communicate  to appeal to the emotions or the intellect  it has to
combine various visual elements to express meaning or emotion  It s really the visual
components of the work  things like color  texture  shape  lines and how these
elements work together  that tell us something about the work  Artists combine and
manipulate these visual elements to express a message or to create a mood 
Think about how a painter might use color  for example  You all know from
experience that different colors appeal in different ways to the senses and can convey
different meanings  An artist chooses certain colors to evoke a particular mood and
make powerful statements  The color red  for example  is a strong color and can
conjure up strong emotions  such as extreme joy or excitement or even anger  Blue 
on the other hand  is considered a cool color  Blue colors tend to have a calming
effect on viewers 
Another visual element important to art is texture  By texture  I mean the surface
quality or feel of the work   its smoothness or roughness or softness  Now  of course 
in some types of art  the texture s physical   it can actually be touched by the fingers 
But in painting  for example  texture can be visual  The way an artist paints certain
areas of the painting can create the illusion of texture  an object s smoothness or
roughness or softness  A rough texture can evoke stronger emotions and strength 
while a smooth texture is more calming and less emotional 
As I said earlier  artists often combine elements to convey a message about the work 
Take a painting that  say  uses a lot of strong colors like reds and oranges and uses
brush strokes that are broad  wide  sweeping brush strokes that suggest a rough
texture  Well  these elements together can convey a wilder  more chaotic emotion in
the viewer than  more than  say  a painting with tiny  smooth brush strokes and soft or
pale colors  Artists use these visual effects and the senses they arouse to give meaning
to their work

Student B 
Yeah  and it sounds like a great idea  It s really good for the students in that program 
Student A 
Don t they cook in class anyway 
Student B 
Well  yeah  they do  But my cousin was in the program a few years ago  and she said
that it s very different to cook for a lot people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook
for classmates 
Student A 
Why is that 
Student B 
Well  in class  you can take your time  but cooking for more people there is more
pressure  I mean you are in a rush  people are waiting  and it might be easy to make a
mistake with all that stress 
Student A 
Then they ll think you are a bad chef right 
Student B 
Absolutely 
Student A 
So  OK  its good practice  But what about the extra cost 
Student B 
Well  look at it this way  You ve eaten at some of the fancier restaurants in town
right 
Student A 
Well  there are some great places to eat around here 
Student B 
Well  these students  they ll be making fantastic meals and it s gonna be cheaper than
going out to one of those restaurants

Nowadays something you notice more and more is television commercials that are
made specifically for certain television programs  So let s say a company wants to sell
a telephone  a cell phone  Now during TV shows that young people watch  you know
shows with pop music or teen serials  they create the commercial that emphasizes
how fun the phone is  You know  the phone has bright colors and they show kids
having a good time with their friends  And well the company wants the kids watching
TV at this time to want to buy this phone  this phone that s made especially for them 
But the same company will make a different commercial to be shown during  say  a
program about business or a business news show  Now for this group of people 
business people  the company will have to show how efficient their phone is  how it
can handle all business easily and maybe even save money  And here is the thing  It s
basically the same phone  The company has just made two different commercials to
appeal to different groups of people

better by then 
Student A 
Oh  okay  so  problem solved  right 
Student B 
Not exactly  I m worried that I m gonna be out of practice  like I haven t been able to
play the violin since I sprained my wrist  What if I don t play well  I d make the rest
of the group sound bad 
Student A 
Why don t you get somebody else to take your place 
Student B 
Well there is only one other person I know of who could do it  and that s Jim  He is a
great violinist  and I m sure he d say yes  The thing is that he is not very reliable  I
mean I m in the orchestra with him and he is always showing up late for rehearsals
Student A 
Oh  so you re not sure you can depend on him

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class 
Professor
Why do we do the things we do  What drives us to participate in certain activities  to
buy a certain car or even to choose a certain career  In other words  what motivates us
to do what we do 
Well  in studies of motivation  psychologists distinguish between two very different
types  Our reasons for doing something  our motivations  can be extrinsic  in other
words  based on some kind of external reward like praise or money  Or they can be
intrinsic  meaning we engage in the activity because it pleases us internally  Both
create strong forces that lead us to behave in certain ways  However  intrinsic
motivation is generally considered to be more long lasting than the other 
As I said  extrinsic motivation is external  It s the desire to behave in a certain way in
order to obtain some kind of external reward  A child  for example  who regularly
does small jobs around the house  does them not because she enjoys taking out the
garbage or doing the dishes but because she knows if she does these things  she ll be
given a small amount of money for doing them  But how motivated will the child be
to continue doing the work if her parents suddenly stop giving her money for it 
With intrinsic or internal motivation  we want to do something because we enjoy it or
get a sense of accomplishment from it  Most people who are internally motivated get
pleasure from the activity so they just feel good about doing it  For example  I go to
the gym several times a week  I don t go because I m training for a marathon or
anything  I just enjoy it  I have more energy after I exercise and I know it s good for
my health so it makes me feel good about myself  And that s what kept me going
there in the past five years

Now listen to two students discussing the letter 
Student A 
I totally disagree with Tim s proposal 
Student B 
Why 
Student A 
Well look  Tim s my friend  but he s not your typical student  He stays up late partying
every night  week nights too 
Student B 
If he parties every night  no wonder he can t pay attention 
Student A 
Yes  and most students aren t like that  They come to class prepared and rested and
they can concentrate 
Student B 
So  you are saying the problem is really Tim 
Student A 
Yes  he was in one of my classes last year and whenever I looked at him he was
actually sleeping 
Student B 
I guess if he s sleeping  he can t really know what s happening  what other people in
class are doing 
Student A 
Right  and you want to know what does happen in that last hour of seminar  In a lot
of seminars that I ve been in  that s when things get interesting 
Student B 
Really 
Student A 
Yes  that s usually when students get really involved in their discussion and start
exchanging important ideas  And if the history department actually did what Tim
suggests  well  if they did that  what would happen is you lose what might be the most
worthwhile part of the seminar

Ok  uh    the first kind of memory  we re all very familiar with this  right  You
probably remember what you had for dinner last night   you have a Conscious
Memory of last night s dinner  So  um  if I ask you  what did you eat last night   you
could tell me 
But these other kind of memories    implicit Memories   they work differently  Let s
take an example from the world of advertising  When you re driving along a highway 
you ll see plenty of billboards   you know  road side advertisements  You certainly
don t remember them all  But they still affect you 
Marketing researchers have shown  well  to be specific  let s say there s a billboard on
the highway advertising a     car  called the  Panther   The ad shows a big picture of a
car and above the car in huge letters is the name of the car   Panther   A lot of people
drive by the billboard  But ask those drivers later if they saw any advertisements for
cars  and well  they ll think about it and a lot of them will say  no   They honestly don t
remember seeing any  They have no conscious memory of the  Panther  billboard 
So  you ask the same people a different question  You ask  um   ok  um   you ask them
to name an animal starting with the letter  p   What do you think they ll answer  Do
they say  pig    Pig  is the most common animal that starts with the letter  p   but they
don t say  pig   They say  Panther   The billboard had an effect even though the drivers
don t remember ever seeing it

Now listen to a conversation between a professor and a student 
Professor 
Hi  Sara  Uh  to what do I owe the pleasure of this office visit 
Student 
It s my study group  Professor Wilson  We are not getting much studying done  And 
you know  not all of us did very well on your last quiz 
Professor 
Hmm    What s the problem 
Student 
Well  we ve all become good friends and we joke around a lot instead of studying 
Professor 
Hmm    Sara  let me ask you this  When do you meet 
Student 
Every Friday afternoon 
Professor 
Have you thought about changing to another day  By the time Friday afternoon rolls
around  all of you are probably exhausted  and um  all you want to do is relax and um 
unwind  It s hard to stay focused at the very end of the week 
Student 
Good point  Although things have gotten so out of hand that I m not sure changing
days would help  And we d lose one or two people if we change days  Friday
afternoon is the only time everyone is available  But it s worth considering 
Professor 
OK  But  just a second  another possibility is  does your group have a leader 

86

?



Student 
No 
Professor 
Well  if you had a leader that would help enormously  Someone to set an agenda in
advance  email it to everyone before the meeting  and then make sure when you meet
that you stay focused on your goals  And since you seem to be concerned enough
about the problem to have come see me  I think that someone might be you 
Student 
I guess I could take on that role  but it sounds like work 
Professor 
You don t have to do it for the whole semester  Sara  You can start it off and then
perhaps someone else can take over 
Task 6

Now listen to part of a talk in an education class 
Professor
One of the hardest parts of teaching is keeping your students  attention  Now  the key
to doing this is understanding the concept of attention  Basically  there are two types
of attention  The first type is  active   Active attention is voluntary  It s when you
intentionally make yourself focus on something  And since it requires effort  it s hard
to keep up for a long time 
Ok  so  um  let s say you re teaching a  a biology class  and today s topic is  frogs   all
right  You re standing at the front of the room and lecturing 
 A frog is a type of animal known as an amphibian   Well  this isn t necessarily
going to keep the students  interest  But most of them will force themselves to pay
active attention to your lecture  But it s only a matter of time before they get
distracted 
Now the other type of attention is passive attention when it s involuntary  Passive
attention requires no effort because it happens naturally  If something s really
interesting  students don t have to force themselves to pay attention to it  They do it
without even thinking about it  So  back to our biology lecture  you start talking about
frogs  and then you pull a live frog out of your briefcase  You re describing it while
you hold it up  show the students how long its legs are and  and how they re used for
jumping  for example  Then  maybe you ll even let the frog jump around a bit on the
desk or the floor  In this case  by doing something unexpected  something more
engaging  you can tap in to their passive attention and it can last much longer than
active attention  As long as the frog is still there  your students will be interested

Student A 
Everything all right 
Student B 
Yeah  I m just upset about that article I showed you this morning 
Student A 
Why  What s the big deal 
Student B 
Well  as an art major  I think it s a big loss for the department  The university s got it
all wrong 
Student A 
Why  What do you mean 
Student B 
Well  the low enrollment isn t because art majors don t want to take these classes 
Problem is  who has time to take them when there are so many other requirements 
Student A 
I   I don t understand 
Student B 
See  the classes they are eliminating are all optional  The required courses are mostly
painting and drawing and they take up all our time  What we really need are different
requirements  Then art majors could take a better variety of classes  all the things we
are interested in 
Student A 
That makes sense  But  the thing about the professor 
Student B 
Well  that s true  But still  they are being drastic  If money is the problem  they could
hire a part time professor  or  most of the professors in the department have secondary
fields 
Student A 
Really

Yeah  At least a few painting teachers are also great sculptors  I m sure one of them

This happens all the time with kids in schools  Say there is a little boy or a girl who s
just starting school  Well  they are not really used to the rules about proper behavior
for a classroom  So at the beginning  they might  I don t know  interrupt the teacher 
walk around the classroom when they are supposed to be sitting down  you know just
misbehaving in general 
OK  but what happens  Well  the teacher gets angry with them when they act this way 
They might get punished  They have to sit at their desks when everyone else is
allowed to go outside and play  and they certainly don t like that  Soon they ll learn
that this kind of behavior gets them in trouble  They ll also learn that when they raise
their hand to talk to the teacher and sit quietly and pay attention during class  they are
rewarded  The teacher tells them she is proud of them  and maybe puts little happy
face stickers on their homework  Now that their behavior gets a good reaction from
the teacher  the kids learn to always act this way in class and not behave the way they
used to

Student B 
Can you believe this  My computer broke yesterday  so it s at the shop being repaired 
It won t be ready until the end of next week  which is when all my papers are due 
Student A 
Why not use the computer lab  They ve got lots of machines there 
Student B 
I know  But it gets so noisy there that I can t keep my mind on my work  I mean when
I m at the computer  I m not just typing   I m thinking  So I need quiet to concentrate 
Student A 
Maybe you could try going in the morning or evening  It might be less noisy then 
Student B 
Maybe  but this time of year everybody is working on papers and it could be crowded
even then 
Student A 
Um   what about calling back the computer repair shop to see if they can have your
computer ready at the beginning of next week instead  That would still give you
enough time to finish your papers by the end of the week 
Student B 
Oh  I haven t thought of that  The only problem is that the shop is closed today and
tomorrow for the long holiday weekend so it would be a few days before I could talk
to them 
Task 6

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a business class
Professor If a consumer has to choose between two products  what determines the
choice  Assume that someone  a purchaser  is choosing between two products that
cost the same  ok  If people have a choice between two identically priced products 
which one will they choose  They choose the one they think is of higher quality of
course  but what does mean for a product to be a high quality product  Well  business
analysts usually speak of two major factors of quality  One factor is reliability and the
other is what we call features 
So  reliability  What s reliability  Well a product is reliable  if it works the way we
expect it to work  if it can go a reasonable amount of time without needing repairs  If
a product  a car for example  doesn t work the way it should and needs repairs too
soon  we say it s unreliable  So product reliability means basically the absence of
defects or problems that you aren t expecting  It used to be that when people thought
about product quality  they thought mainly about reliability  Today it s different 
People do still care about reliability  don t get me wrong  It s just that manufacturing
standards are now so high that   we ll take cars for example today  Today s cars are
very reliable  so reliability is important but it iss not gonna be the deciding factor  So
if reliability is not the deciding factor any more  what is  Features  All those extras 
the things a product has that aren t really necessary but that make it easier to use or
that make it cool  For example  new cars today are loaded with features like electric
windows  sunroofs  air conditioning  stereos and so forth  When people are comparing
products today  they look at features  because reliability s pretty much equal across
the board and that s why manufacturers include so many features in their products

like to study while they eat  especially if they have exams coming up or some
assignment they have to get done

And now they won t to be able to concentrate  This is gonna be very distracting

Hm  ok  yeah  I see your point

And second  most students don t like classical music 
Student B 
It s certainly not what I listen to 
Student A 
So are people going to stop listening to their own music 
Student B 
No

I think people are going to be even more likely to bring their mp3 player  you know 
to play their own music and block out the classical stuff 
Student B 
Yeah  that makes sense 
Task 4
Narrator
Now listen to part of a lecture from a biology class 
Professor
There is a large tropical insect called the Peanut Bug  yes like the peanuts that you eat 
Um and the peanut bug s front wings are colored so that they blend in with their
surroundings  But its back wings  which are usually closed and hidden  have these
bright colorful spots on them and when the peanut bug s attacked  it suddenly opens
its back wings and out pop these big bright colors  And that surprises the predator and
gives the peanut bug a chance to get away 
Um and then you have a butterfly called the morpho Butterfly  and parts of the
morpho butterfly s wings are very shiny  They reflect a lot of sunlight  When this
butterfly is resting  this shiny part of its wings is hidden  Now morpho butterflies are
often attacked by birds  So when a bird approaches  the morpho flies away  And when
the morph flaps its wings  all the bird can see are flashes of light reflected from the
morpho s wings  Those flashes of light make it very difficult for the bird to follow the
morpho  and the morpho is usually able to get away

This is my last semester  and I ve still got two required courses left to take in order to

Student A 
OK 
Student B 
I have to take both History of the Novel and Shakespeare  or I can t graduate  Problem
is the two courses meet at the same time 
Student A 
Uh oh  What are you gonna do 
Student B 
Well  I talked to the professor who s gonna teach Shakespeare  He said I could do an
independent study to fulfill that requirement 
Student A 
How would that work 
Student B 
I d read the assigned texts on my own  do all the same assignments and meet with him
when I need to  if I have any questions 
Student A 
Well  that sounds like a good way to fulfill the requirement 
Student B 
Yeah  plus it would be nice to have one on one discussions with the professor  It s
just that… well  working on my own like that  I am kind of concerned I won t be able
to motivate myself enough to get the work done on time  It is easy to put things off
when it is not actual class  you know 
Student A 
Are there other options 
Student B 
Emm  yeah  I found out that the shaksper class is being offered at another university
about half an hour from here  That university has a really great literature program and
our university will accept their credits  so
Student A 
That s an idea 
Student B 
Yeah  I am sure it d be a good class and it ll fulfill the requirement  Only thing is  you
know  I have to drive a half a hour to get to the class and a half an hour to come back 
three times a week  That s a lot of time and gas in money
Task 6
Narrator
Now listen to part of a lecture in a business class 
Professor
Today we ll talk about how companies determine the initial price for their products 
by that I mean when they first introduce a product in the market  There are different

92

?



approaches and today we will discuss two of them  They are quite different  each with
their own advantages 
One approach  or strategy  sets the initial price of the product high  followed by a
lower price at a later stage  Why  Well  when introducing a new product  companies
want to build a high quality image for it  Products that cost more are believed to be of
higher quality  So  during the early stages of the product life cycle  companies can
make very high profits from consumers willing to pay more for a high quality product 
and although consumers know that prices will eventually go down  they are also
willing to pay more to get the product sooner  This approach works very well with  oh 
innovative high tech products for example  Now just think about when video
recorders  or video cameras  or even cell phones first came out  They were very
expensive  but then they became much more accessible 
Another very common strategy sets an initial price low  Now this happens when the
market is already saturated with the product and the strategy is to undercut its
competitors  Say there is a newly starting computer maker trying to gain market share 
so what do they do  Well  they offer a computer at an affordable price  lower than
existing brands  By doing this  the company appeals to new consumers who weren t
probably even interested in getting a computer  and  well of course  to existing
consumers who might now be tempted to switch brands  Now how does this company
make profits with its low price computer  Well  one thing that s often done is to
encourage their customers to buy accessories also manufactured by them  like printers
or software for example

nothing very meaningful 
Student A 
Oh  so you wouldn t actually learn anything new 
Student B 
Exactly 
Student A 
Ah  I guess I see what you mean  But what about the other point they make 
Student B 
About this helping us after we graduate  I don t agree 
Student A 
How come 
Student B 
Well  the problem is that there are lots of other universities in our area that have the
same requirement  so there are lots of other students at these positions 
Student A 
Yeah  I guess I hadn t thought of that 
Student B 
So even if you take a position like this in a company while you are still a student 
once you graduate  the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible  I mean
there just won t be enough jobs available for the business graduates in the city who
will be looking for full time work 
Student A 
Hmm  I see what you are saying 
Task 4
Narrator
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a film class 
Professor
So  the other day I went to this great new movie and one of the scenes in particular I
thought was really set up nicely 
At the start of the scene  before the action and talking and things started  you saw  on
the movie screen  an image of a city  You could tell it was a big city  There were lots
of buildings  tall ones  skyscrapers  And the cars and signs on the city streets looked
old fashioned  like they were from the past  like the 1940s  The other thing I noticed
right away from this first image  just when the scene started  was that the city seemed
gloomy  You couldn t see much because it was  well  there was mostly darkness rather
than sunlight  And there was only just a little bit of light from the street lamps  On top
of that  it was raining  and kind of foggy  All of these details worked together to
create a dark  gloomy  mysterious feeling 
So then when the action started  and it showed detectives talking to each other in an
office  I already knew that the office was located in a tall building in a big city
sometime in the 1940s  And I had a good idea that the events that would be taking

94

place would be pretty dark and mysterious because of the shot  the image I saw at the
beginning of the scene

Student A 
You are kidding  Why 
Student B 
Well  my apartment   it s in a house  a kind of old house  And now something s wrong
with the water pipes  I think some of the pipes burst or wore out or something 
Anyway  we don t have any water in the house  And apparently  it s gonna take about
two weeks to fix the problem 
Student A 
So you need to find a place to live for what  two weeks or so 
Student B 
Yeah  Bad timing  huh  with mid term exams coming up and everything 
Student A 
So have you figured out what you are going to do 
Student B 
Well  some friends said I could stay at their place  They don t have an extra bedroom 
but they said it d be OK for me to sleep on their living room couch 
Student A 
You could probably handle that for a couple of weeks right 
Student B 
1 guess so  I mean it s really nice of them to offer  and it s free  The only problem is
they already have four people living there so it could be a little crowded 
Student A 
And not ideal for studying for mid terms 
Student B 
Yeah  too many distractions 
Student A 
Um  any other options 
Student B 
Well  I did find this place  It s a small hotel over on 3rd Street right near campus 
Student A 
Oh right  A lot of kids  parents stay there when they come for a visit 
Student B 
Right  so I could get a room there  They have a weekly rate and it s pretty reasonable 
but   I don t know 
Student A

At least at the hotel you d have a place of your own  you know  so you could get more
done

will still end up costing me some money and my budget s pretty tight right now 
Task 6
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor
We all know that insects like to eat plants  But some plants have been able to…to
develop ways to protect themselves from insects  Today I m gonna talk about some
ways plants defend themselves 
Now  some plants have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them 
like the passion plant for example  Its leaves have little spiky hairs all over them 
They are like spikes  sticking out of the plant that are so numerous and dense that they
prevent insects from landing on the leaves  Basically there s just no room for the
insect to land  And since insects can t land on the leaves they can t eat them  So the
little hairs serve as a physical feature that helps protect the passion plant from insects 
All right  But other plants protect themselves using chemical defenses  like the potato
plant  The potato plant s able to release a chemical throughout its leaf system
whenever an insect attacks it  starts eating leaf  So  say an insect starts eating a potato
plant s leaf  That will cause the plant to react by releasing a chemical throughout its
leaf system  The insect swallows this chemical as it eats  And this chemical
discourages the insect from wanting to eat any more of the plant  How  Well  the
substance makes the insect feel full  like it s already had enough to eat  The insect no
longer feels hungry  So it stops eating the plant  So  by emitting this chemical  the
potato plant protects itself from insects

OK  so I ve actually got a few different examples of this  You know when I was kid  a
character named Action Hero was really popular with my friends and me  We would
always watch the Action Hero program on television every week  and played games 
pretending that we were strong and powerful as he was  Then pretty soon we began
seeing this small Action Hero figures in all the stores  And well we all just had to
have them  I mean we d been watching the television show for so long that it seemed
only natural to want to own the toys too

Well I finally grew up and left the Action Hero television program and toys behind 
But now I have a seven year old daughter who watches television a lot and also likes
to play with her toys  And lately her favorite toy is a cute little baby doll with a big
round face and lots of curly hair named Rosa  All my daughters  friends have Rosa
dolls too  And they enjoy going to each other s houses to play with them  Then a few
weeks ago  my daughter came running up to me all excited because she had just heard
there was going to be a new television program on every week with the doll Rosa as
the main character  So naturally she and all her friends have begun watching the show 
And it s already very popular  as popular as the toy doll

know  tomorrow when you go to class  just ask him if he d give you an extra day to
get the paper done  I m pretty sure he d agree  you know  with this storm and all 
Student A 
Yeah  that d sure be a lot easier  But then he did tell us when he gave us the
assignment that he wouldn t grant any extensions 
Student A 
You don t think he d grant an extension in this case 
Student A 
I m not sure  It s a little risky  He might just say that we shouldn t have waited until

Professor
OK  we generally assume that babies can feel only very basic emotions like happiness
or anger  that is that babies just react to things that happen directly to them  However 
some new research is suggesting that babies may be able to feel concern for others  to
have empathy for others  Now empathy is a complex emotion  It involves a baby
relating to someone else s emotions  not just reacting to things happening directly to
them  Let s talk about an experiment that may show that babies could be capable of
feeling empathy 
OK  for the first part of the experiment  well  um  we ve always known that babies
start to cry when they hear other babies crying  right  One baby in the room starts
crying and all the rest join in  We ve always assumed that the other babies cried
because they were reacting to the noise of the crying  that the noise itself was
distressing  So in the experiment researchers played a tape recording  a tape of babies
crying  to another baby  And sure enough the baby started crying when he heard the
sound of other babies crying  This was no surprise of course  And researchers
assumed that the baby cried because of the noise 
But the next part of the experiment was surprising  The researchers played the baby a
tape of his own crying  Now it was just as noisy so the researchers expected him to
cry  However this time the baby did not cry  He wasn t upset by the sound of his own
crying  Why not  Well  maybe it wasn t the noise that had made him cry before when
he heard other babies crying  In fact  maybe noise had nothing to do with it  It could
be that the baby felt empathy for the other babies  And that was why he got upset
when he heard them crying  The researchers concluded that it is indeed possible that
babies feel empathy  concern for others

The college is making a mistake with this new plan 
Student B 
What do you mean  I think it ll really help accomplish the college s goals 
Student A 
Don t be so sure  All that construction for two years  It s gonna create a lot of noise 
Student B

?



Well you mean in the beginning  for students still living in the dorms 
Student A 
Yeah  students who are trying to sleep or do work are constantly going to be disturbed 
So people will try to get as far away as possible  probably by moving off campus  So
they ll lose even more people 
Student B 
Huh  I hadn t thought of that  But still  once all construction is over  more people will
probably want to live in the dorms  right  I mean  the living conditions will be so
much better 
Student A 
If they can afford to  Do you know how the college is planning on paying for this plan
by raising the cost of campus housing 
Student B 
I didn t realize that 
Student A 
Yeah  So if it s more expensive  why would people want to move back into the dorms
if they can rent an apartment for less money 
Task 4
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class 
Professor
All right  so let s consider the work of the outsider artist   Henry Darger  Darger lived
by himself in a tiny apartment in Chicago in the 1900s  He had no friends and spent
all his spare time there alone creating hundreds of paintings and drawings  He had
never formally studied art and kept his work completely private  so no one ever saw it
or responded to it during his lifetime  And so when you see Darger s work  you notice
how unique it is  It doesn t remind you of anything you ve ever seen before  It s very
much his own 
For example  one piece   it s a water color painting  In this piece he illustrates a story
about the adventures of seven children  But see  Darger had a really hard time
drawing human figures  yet he managed to come up with his own rather unique
solution for the problem  He simply cut out pictures of children from newspapers and
magazines and pasted them into his own painted illustration of trees  flowers and
grass  The results look   umm…a little strange  Darger s picture looks more cluttered 
more crowded with details than the pictures of other artists because its entire surface s
painted and there are no spaces left empty  It s also a lot longer than the pictures of
most other artists  about nine feeing long 
Task 5

Now listen to a conversation between two students 
Student A 
By the way  Frank  I heard you got a summer research position with Professor Davis 
Student B 
Uh  huh    but  I ve got a problem 
Student A 

100

?



Oh 
Student B 
Yeah  well  since I didn t hear from her for so long I assumed I didn t get the position 
So I didn t apply for a dorm room for the summer  I m afraid it s too late for that now 
Student A 
Yeah  the deadline for campus housing applications has already passed  So what are
you gonna do now 
Student B 
Well  I can stay with my parents  They live two hours from here  So I thought I could
drive and commute to campus every day  I know my mom and dad would be happy to
have me over for a few weeks  and most of my old friends will be home for the
summer  So in a way it d be fun 
Student A 
Yeah  I understand  But you d spend quite a bit of time on the road going back and
forth  Won t you get tired 
Student B 
Yeah  that thought did cross my mind  The other thing I could do is rent an apartment
off campus  Besides being much closer to work  I d also save tons of money on gas 
Student A 
Uh huh  but then you d have to pay rent 
Student B 
I know    there s always something  isn t there 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an interior design class 
Professor 
So we re talking about interior design   uh   specifically the basic principles typically
used in home and office decoration in the United States  Effective designs create a
delicate balance between two things  you need unity and you also need contrast which
is essentially a break in unity  Now this might seem a little contradictory  but let me
explain why we need both of these for an effective design 
So for the first principle  we need unity in our design  Think of it as consistency  Well 
an easy and very effective way to do this is by bringing together similar elements  A
common example is by matching colors  You pick a color and use it for different parts
of the room  Say you pick green and then use a light shade of green for the walls and
maybe a somewhat darker shade for the fabric on the sofa  and finally complement
that with a matching green in the rug  When elements match  the room is unified and
gives its residents a sense of order and comfort 
OK  but there is such a thing as too much unity  Remember you need a balance of
unity and contrast  If all you do is focus on unity  the result will be a boring room  So
what do you do  Well  you apply the second basic principle of design  which is
contrast  Contrast serves to disrupt or break up the unity in places  but in a careful
intentional way  Um  well  let s continue using color as an example  To create contrast 
color contrast  you need to abruptly change your color scheme in a while  Ah let s see 
you could throw white red cushions on your dark green sofa  for example  Contrast
makes things stand out  The green will look even greener next to the red  So  now

101

?



your room is more interesting  not completely the same  But watch out  Too much
contrast is also dangerous  just like too much sameness is  Too much contrast will
make the room feel busy  chaotic

Task 3
Narrator
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
What do you think of the proposal 
Student B 
I think it ll work  I mean  the range of the station now is basically limited to the
campus  and so it s basically just a few programs  mainly for students 
Student A 
Yeah 
Student B 
Well  if this proposal goes through  there will be more programs and they would give
the students more professional experience as they experiment with programming for a
much larger  you know  real life audience  And stuff like that will give them a better
shot at getting a job after they graduate 
Student A 
Of course 
Student B 
Besides  the whole university will benefit from it 
Student A 
What do you mean 
Student B 
Well  you know my friend Tony  right  He told me that the radio station at his
university did something like this about five years ago 
Student A 
And 
Student B 

102

Well  it s a success  They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are
using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities
of other programs 
Student A 
That sounds really good 
Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class 
Professor 
Consider this experiment  Two groups of people were asked to watch TV  And while
they were watching  a picture flashed on the screen  less than a second  very quickly
so it was barely noticeable  The picture was a boy with a birthday cake 
Now like I said  there were two groups  and each group saw a slightly different
version of the picture  One group got the boy looking angry  In fact he was actually
throwing the cake on the floor  The other group got a picture of the boy smiling 
happy  holding out the cake like he was offering it  Same boy  same cake  but
different emotions expressed in each picture 
Everyone was then asked to look at a different image  Now this is a third image  right 
Again it s the boy and the cake  but this time the image stayed on the screen  In this
picture  the boy is just holding the cake  basically no emotion on his face  everything
very neutral  Now remember  nobody knew they d already seen a picture of this boy 
After a minute  everyone was asked to describe the boy s personality  Those who d
been exposed to the image of the angry boy  they generally described the boy s
personality negatively  Those who d earlier seen the happy boy described him  well 
positively 
Task 5
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between two students 
Student A 
Hey Madison  What s wrong 
Student B 
Oh  I m just struggling about what to do  I won an award from the Pacific Journalism
Institute for an article I submitted  and   
Student B 
   doesn t sound like anything s wrong 
Student B 
Well  it s a huge honor to win and there is an award ceremony they ve invited me to
attend  which I m super excited about  But  and here is what s frustrating  I ve got a
philosophy exam that s scheduled to end right when the ceremony begins 
Student A 
Oh   you are saying you ll just be finishing up taking the exam right when the
ceremony starts 
Student B 
Exactly 
Student A 

103

?



But those ceremonies never start on time  They give long introductions  you know 
have a general speech or something before they ever get to handing out awards  I m
sure they won t be ready to hand out your award right at the beginning  Just go when
you are done with the test  You won t miss anything important 
Student B 
Maybe  but that s a bit risky  I don t want to miss being there when they announce my
name 
Student A 
Well  have you talked to your professor about this 
Student B 
Doctor Forester  No 
Student A 
Maybe she ll let you take the exam some other time 
Student B 
True  She lets people reschedule exams sometimes  But she always makes them take
it a couple of days early  That would mean less studying time for me  which I m not
thrilled about 
Student A 
Less time to study… oh 
Student B 
Like I said  I am still struggling about what to do 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class 
Professor
So when we talk about the demand for a product  we are referring to how much
consumers want to buy it  right  And often the demand for a product is influenced by
its price   the more expensive it becomes the less chance that people will want to buy
it  OK  but  um that s not the whole story  Sometimes the demand for a product can
also be influenced by the price of other related products 
First  there are those products called substitute goods  If products can be substituted
for one another  then  um  well  then they are called substitute goods  They are similar
enough to be interchangeable  And an increase in the price of one means an increase
in the demand for the other  like…like butter and margarine  They are pretty much
used for the same purposes  Margarine are butter substitute and you can bake equally
well with either  Well  when the price of butter goes up  it becomes less affordable
and so what will people do  They buy margarine instead  right  So  uh  you see an
increase in the price of butter increases the demand for margarine 
Now another instance where the price of one product can influence the demand of
another is uh   is when you have two products that can t be used without each other 
Those products  we call complement goods   they complement  or uh  complete each
other if you will like compact discs and compact disc players  You need both products
in order to use either  So if the price of either product increases  demand for both is
likely to decrease  And if the price of CDs goes up  well  demand for them will go
down  right  And because CDs and CD players complement each other  what will
also happen is that the demand for CD players will go down too

Student A 
So what do you think of the university s new plan 
Student B 
Oh  I don t know  I don t think it s gonna work 
Student A 
No 
Student B 
I mean I can t imagine top students being too thrilled about some of the conditions on
this campus 
Student A 
What do you mean 
Student B 
Like the science laboratories having such old  outdated equipment  and the library
needing more books and the student center being so small  I think that two million
could be spent in better places if the university is really serious about achieving its
goal 
Student A 
Ok  but what about the other reason for building the stadium  I mean right now we
have so little contact with the town 
Student B 
Yeah  but this won t help relations  Look  people from town hardly ever come to
games because our teams always lose and they are not suddenly going to improve
overnight  Besides  adding seat won t make a different  I mean if people from town
didn t come before  They won t come now just because the place is bigger

Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class 
Professor 
Let s take an everyday example an ordinary round plat like you d find in a kitchen  If
you hold the plate directly in front of your face and look at it  what shape do you see 
A perfect circle  right  Suppose you tilt the plate to a different angle  to a horizontal
position  like you are planning to put food on it  Still a perfect circle  No  the circle is
now stretched out  flattened into an oval  Do you conclude the plate has actually
changed shape  or that it is a different object  not the same plate  Of course not  it
looks different  but we perceive it as still being the same 
Here is a different example  This classroom we are in  it is fairly large  right  Now 
from up close  from the front row  I appear to be relatively big  bigger than if you
were in the last row  right  But let s say you are sitting in a front row today  but
tomorrow you are sitting in the back row  From back there I am going to look smaller 
but you don t think I ve actually gotten smaller  You don t think you are seeing a
different professor  a guy who looks like me except he is smaller  No matter where
you are  up close or for away  you understand without evening thinking about it that I
am the same size  the same person 
Task 5

Hey   Mark  how is it going

Hm…not so good

Student B 
Well  you know I am the president of the anthropology club  Well  I am supposed to
drive everyone in the club to see a special exhibit at the museum tomorrow  My mom
said I could borrow her van  you know  so everyone would fit  But unfortunately  it
broke down and it is not gonna be repaired in time for the trip 
Student A 
Oh  So what are you going to do  Can you rent a van 
Student B 
Yeah  that s a possibility  It s a little risky for me thought  I ve tried to get in touch
with the club members  but only four have gotten back to me and said they d
contribute some money to the cost 
Student A 
What about the other member 
Student B 
I don t know  It d probably be ok with them too  but that s the risk  I don t know for
sure  I don t want to get stuck with having to pay for the most of the bill 
Student A 

106

Well  since not everyone has gotten back to you  why don t you just postpone the trip 
you know  until your mom s van is repaired 
Student B 
Yeah  I could do that  though I am sure everyone could be real disappointed if they
show up tomorrow ready to go and find out that we are not going 
Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor
Now many sea animals  in order to hide from predators  have  over time  developed
different kinds of camouflage to help them blend in with their environment and avoid
detection by predators  Picture the surface of the sea floor  It s as varied as the land
we live on  It s got peaks and valleys  vegetation  rocky areas  and some sea animals
have developed permanent colors or shapes to resemble these environmental features 
This camouflage helps disguise them from predators by enabling them to blend into a
specific part of the sea  For instance  take a kind of fish  like the leafy sea dragon 
Well the name says it all  It resembles a small green dragon with leaf like protrusions
sticking out like arms  And because of its color and shape  it blends in extremely well
with green sea plants  So when the leafy sea dragon is swimming through these plants 
predators have trouble seeing it  But when it enters other environments without these
green plants  its camouflage doesn t work anymore 
Now other sea animals are difficult to spot anywhere in the sea because their type of
camouflage enables them to change color  Take the cuddle fish  a fish that s closely
related to the squid and octopus  Unlike leafy sea dragons  cuddle fish have not
developed any particular shape to hide from predators  but they have a lot more
mobility because their camouflage allows them to blend into any environment
because cuddle fish have shifting pigments that allow them to change color in a
matter of seconds  And so they can almost instantaneously match the color of their
surroundings  If they are swimming by green sea plants  they ll turn green  and if they
are swimming over the brown sea floor  they ll turn brown

It d be kinda nice to be able to do that  huh 
Student B 
No  actually I don t think it s a good idea 
Student A 
Why not 
Student B 
Well  like the part about how it would help students concentrate  I mean maybe a little
snack will help the person who s eating it  But the trouble is that it makes it hard for
everyone else to concentrate coz they have to listen to someone munching on chips or
biting into an apple or crinkling paper wrappers 
Student A 
I guess is can be kind of disruptive 
Student B 
Yeah  it would interfere with everyone s concentration  You wouldn t be able to pay
attention with all the noises going on 
Student A 
Ok  I guess I have to agree with you on that  But what about her other reason  It
would be nice to able to have some fun at the end of the semester  right 
Student B 
No  there is a problem with that too 
Student A 
Why 
Student B 
Well  I don t think it appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing  I mean  the
last classes are usually pretty important  That s when we will do a lot reviewing for
final exams 
Student A 
True 
Student B 
If we use that time for that  we probably wouldn t have time to do as much reviewing

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class 
Professor 
Ok  So this comes up a lot when people make career decisions  A friend of mine from
college always wanted to be a film reviewer  He was a film major and he loved
movies  Most of all  he loved to write about movies  So when he graduated  he looked
for a job as a film reviewer for a newspaper  because as a film reviewer  he d get to
see films for free and would be paid to write about them  That s what he loved  But he
couldn t find a job as a film reviewer  So he took a position as a news reporter instead 
For a newspaper  investigating stories  writing about events what news reporters do 
Now  at first  my friend wasn t sure he d be any good at this  He d never been a news
reporter before  But eventually he adjusted and gained confidents and he got used to
the job  And he realized he was actually a pretty good reporter  Anyway  here is the
thing  After a few years  the film reviewer of the newspaper where he worked quit and
my friend was offered her job  This was his dream  right  His opportunity to be a film
reviewer had finally come and the new job would actually pay more  too  But did he
take the job  Nope  he turned it down  He told me he d gotten used to being a reporter 
And the just didn t want to try something else  It seems like too big of a change  since 
well  there was a chance that the new job might not work out

What s going on 
Student B 
Well  I live in a dormitory and I ve got a great roommate for the last two years  but he
is moving off campus next semester 
Student A 
Oh  so… 
Student B 
So now I have to make a big decision  you know  about my living arrangement 
Student A 
Well  couldn t you just get a new roommate  Doesn t the university automatically
assign someone to take his place 
Student B 
Yeah they do  The thing is I am concerned about sharing a room with somebody new 
There could be problems like what if he wanted to go to sleep at 10 o clock  I am used
to studying late at night and that would throw off my whole study schedule 
Student A 
I guess that s possible  But it is convenient to be on campus  easy to get to class and
all  What else could you do 
Student B 

109

?



Well  my roommate found a house off campus with some other friends and there s
another bedroom available  I could have it but I have to let them known by the end of
the week 
Student A 
A house sounds like a good idea  It d be fun to live with a group of people 
Student B 
True and it would definitely be economical with everyone splitting the rent  But it s
just that this house is really far from campus  I d have to wake up much earlier to get
to class  It d just be a lot more inconvenient than living in the dorm 
Task6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class 
Professor 
A lot of plants and animals live near the surface of the ocean and that means there s a
lot of food near the surface  because there are lots of plants and animals to eat  But if
you go down to the deepest parts of the ocean  it s cold and dark  And there is not a
lot living down there  So food there is very scarce  So organisms that live down at
these great depths have developed special adaptations to help them survive in this
environment where food is so hard to find 
For example  many deep sea organisms have body features that enable them to eat
prey that are larger than themselves  A good example  um  there is a species of eel
that has an enormous mouth and a large stomach that s capable of expanding and
these unusual features allow this ell to eat prey larger than itself  That s a big
advantage because if the ell eats something big  that s a lot of food  a lot of nutrition 
So the ell can go for quite a while before it has to find food again 
Another helpful adaptation in some deep sea organisms is the ability to generate light 
And some organisms use that light to help them capture food  For example  there is a
kind of fish called the angler fish  and on its head this fish has a little structure that
produces light that glows in the dark  This little structure  this little light is positioned
close to the fish s mouth  Other fish are attracted to this light  They think it is
something small they can eat  So they swim straight toward it and that brings them
close enough for the angle fish to capture them and eat them

Student B 
I think it s a terrible idea 
Student A 
How come

Well  she really hasn t thought it through  like the thing about making them safer 
What she is not thinking about is the long term consequences of running on a hard
surface 
Student A 
What do you mean 
Student B 
I mean it s not good for you  It s too hard on your bones and joints  If you run
repeatedly on a hard surface  it can lead to injuries  or that s what I ve been taught
anyway  It s better to run on a soft surface  It does less damage to your body 
Student A 
Oh  I wasn t aware of that 
Student B 
Yeah  so actually it wouldn t be safer  And her second point 
Student A 
About changing the way they look 
Student B 
Yeah  I don t think people will like it 
Student A 
So they d use them less 
Student B 
Yeah  I mean one of the main reasons people enjoy them now is it s a way of taking a
break from the rest of campus  from building and streets and stuff  It s  you know  a
chance to feel like you are out in nature 
Student A 
Oh  so you wouldn t get that effect anymore

Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class 
Professor 
For example  I recently read about a case in which a researcher was given two groups
of monkeys and he was asked to train these monkeys to pick up ball and puck it in a

box  And he was told to record how many hours it took to train each monkey to learn
to do this 
Now before he started the training  the researcher was told that one group of monkeys
was highly intelligent  and that the other group was less intelligent  In truth  there was
no difference between them  All the monkeys were actually very similar in terms of
intelligence  But the researcher didn t know that  He though one group was smarter 
So he expected that that group would be easier to train 
So what happened  Well  the researcher trained the monkeys to perform the action
and it turned out that on average it took him two hours less time to train the
supposedly smart monkeys than these supposedly less intelligent monkeys  Why 
Well  it turns out that with the supposedly smart monkeys  the researcher smile them a
lot  gave me a lot of encouragement  talked to them a lot  worked hard to
communicate with them  But with the monkeys he thought were less intelligent  he
wasn t enthusiastic  He didn t try quite as hard  wasn t quite as optimistic

Student A 
Well I just called the choir director and he is obviously unhappy about all this  But I
told him about another shirt I have  It s not exactly white  not white like the others 
sort of off white  sort of cream colored  And he says it s ok for me to wear it but… 
Student B 
But it s not exactly the same color as the others 
Student A

Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of the lecture in a biology class 
Professor 
Birds have some of the best vision capabilities in the animal kingdom  Some bird
species have vision that is eight to ten times greater than humans  Overall a bird s
eyes are extremely important for its survival  One aspect of bird s eyes that plays a
role in helping them survive  in other words to find food or to avoid predators  is the
position of the eyes in the skull 
Some birds have eyes that face forward on the skull  kind of similar to how human s
eyes are positioned  Forward facing eyes allow a bird to clearly see and judge
distances because it can focus on objects with both of its eyes and correctly perceive
height  width and depth  One type of bird with eyes positioned in the front of the skull
is the hawk  Hawks eat animals like mice  Hawks have such good eyesight that can
spot a tiny mouse in the field from high up in the air  They spot the mouse and swop
down to catch it  Without such good eyesight  they would not be able to spot or catch
their food 
Other birds have eyes that are located on each side of the skull  This positioning of the
eyes can help a bird to avoid predators  Instead for just seeing what s directly in front 
they can see thing that are on either side  permitting them to watch for danger in all
directions  Imagine a duck waiting near the edge of a lake  It needs to spend time
eating grasses and insects  But it also is on constant lookout for danger from it
predator like the fox  Any eye on each side of the duck s head allows it to see a fox
approaching from either side  If it spots a fox  it can they fly away to safety  The
placements of the eyes are critical in helping the duck avoid predators

Ok  so some people worked alone and they were told that the number of potatoes they
each peeled would be recorded  Other peeled potatoes together as part of a group and
they were told that only the total number of potatoes peeled would be recorded  So it
would be impossible to tell how many any one person had done 
Then researched compared the results of the people who worked alone and those that
worked together to see if there was any difference  that is  they took the average score
of the people working alone and compared it to the average score of the people
working together in a group  And they did discover a different  It turns out that people
working as a group peeled significantly fewer potatoes than people who worked
alone 
Task 5
Narrator 
Listen to part of the conversation between two students 
Student A 
Hey Steve  did you get that book on the Russian Revolution professor Harper wants
us to read 
Student B 
No  one of the bookstores in the campus area had it in stock  They will get it in about
two weeks 
Student A 
Hmm…so what are you goona do in the meantime  Remember we are going to be
discussing the book starting next Tuesday 
Student B 
Well  I was thinking of placing a rush order with a bookseller on the internet  so I d
have the book in about a day or two 
Student A 
Yeah  but rush order delivery is expensive  You could easily spend twice as much
money for the book that way 
Student B 
I know  but what choice do I have 
Student A 
Well since we only have to read a few chapters at a time  you are welcome to share
my copy for a few weeks  you know  until you can get yours at the book store 
Student B 
You mean  you would read the chapters assigned  give the book to me  I would read
those chapter then give the book back to you to read the next set of chapters  and so
on 
Student A 
Exactly 
Student B 
Thanks  But  what if I don t get the book back to you in time  Wouldn t you get
behind your reading 
Student A 
Yeah  maybe  but is should work if we are careful

Narrator 
Now listen to part of the talk in a psychology class 
Professor 
Ok  Ever thought about the things that happen to you and what s responsible for them 
We psychologist have a term  locus of control  Locus of control refers
to…um…where people think control over their lives comes from  whether it comes
from themselves or from somewhere else  People who think that control is in
themselves are internals and people who think it comes from somewhere else are
externals 
Let s say there are two people going or job interview  One of them is an internal  She
has an internal locus of control  Since she thinks that control comes from within
herself  she will believe that her success and her preparation are really her
responsibility  So she is likely to really work on her interview skills ahead of time 
Then if she gets the job  she will believer that it s because she has worked so hard and
if she doesn t get it  well  she will probably be disappointed with herself and try to
figure out how she can improve for the next time 
Ok and another job candidate is an external  He perceives other thing  say his
interviewers  to have more influence  After all  it s their decision  It depends on what
mood they are in  and you know  luck  Now with his external locus of control  he is
not as hard on himself  So he is more likely to take risks  He might interview for a job
that he is not completely qualified for  And if he gets it  he will think he is really
lucky  and because he believes external forces are in control  he might think it s
because the interviewers were having a good day  And if he doesn t get it  he will
probably blame the interviewers or bad luck rather than look at himself and try to
figure out what he could have done better

Task 3
Narrator 
Now  listen to two students discussing the announcement 
Student A 
They are making a mistake 
Student B 
What do you mean 
Student A 
Look  they are trying to do away with distractions so we can study better  But with
this change  we won t have anywhere in the library to get together to work on group
projects 
Student B 
True  group project work is common these days 

116

?



Student A 
So instead of buying these new units  they should use the money to bulid meeting
rooms  And that will reduce any noise in the main library areas 
Student B 
Yeah  that s what we could really use  There is just not as much need to work in
isolation 
Student A 
Exactly  and the other thing is what s this about overcrowding  Sure we have more
students enrolled at the university this year  but do we really have a problem with
overcrowding 
Student B 
I don t think so  I always get a whole table to myself 
Student A 
Right  I see empty tables there all the time  It ll just be a waste of money to replace
what we have since what we have now is sufficient for the amount of students that use
the library 
Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a zoology class 
Professor 
Let s start with an example you may be familiar with  What s one thing dogs typically
do when they feel threatened  when they want to protect themselves  That s right 
They show their teeth and when we see this  we know this behavior mean basically
stay away 
Now  here is how this behavior became a recognizable warning  A long time ago  a
dog sensing danger would get ready to bite whatever animal was threatening him  It
started by baring its teeth  But the purpose of doing this was something very simple 
the dog instinctively was making sure it wouldn t bite its own lips when it bit the
other animals  Ok  But what happened  Other dogs  other animals  over time  they
learned that this teeth bearing always came before a dog was going to bite  And so
they started to read it as a signal to be careful  to keep away or risk getting bitten 
This scenario repeated time after time also led to the dog s awareness that by simply
showing its teeth  a lot of the time that was protection enough  What had been a
simple physical preparation to bite had developed into a kind of defense mechanism
in and of itself  The dog learnt it did not need to actually attack but could get the right
result from just communicating the possibility of an attack through showing its teeth 
It started to use this behavior as a warning signal 
Task 5

Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between two students 
Student A 
Hey  sally  I just got the first draft of my research paper from Professor Stone 
Student B 
Just now  I got mine back a few days ago 

117

?



Student A 
Yeah  everyone else in the class that I know of got theirs a few days ago  too 
Student B 
But the deadline  you are running out of time 
Student A 
Yeah  I am worried  I only have one day to review all these comments and write my
final draft  He made a lot of suggestions 
Student B 
You should definitely ask Professor Stone for a deadline extension  He should take
some responsibility for this situation  It is sort of his fault you won t have much time
to work on in before the due date 
Student A 
I ve thought about that  but would he think I was being pushy or criticizing him for
not getting the paper back to me right away  I don t want to offend him 
Student B 
True  but it is you grade we are talking about  You ve got a legitimate concern  But
it s understandable if you are uncomfortable asking 
Student A 
Yeah  I am not a tough Spartan 
Student B 
You know  you could always just do your best with the time you have left  You are a
good student  I bet you can finish it quickly  work really fast and it ll still turn out
good 
Student A 
Do my best for the time I have left  Well  if I worked really hard  I imagine I might do
ok but I d have to be sure to deal with all these comments  I need a good grade 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of the talk in a sociology class 
Professor 
Now  let s talk about a particular cultural process diffusion  Since the beginning of
human history  diverse culture  have taken advantage of one another s innovations
when they have come into contact  Diffusion is the process whereby something
cultural like a custom  a type of food or an invention is spread from one group to
another or from one society to another  One group adopts a cultural item or  more
selectively  just part of cultural item of another group  you see  Now diffusion can
occur through a variety of ways  military conquest or tourism or even something like
the influence of satellite TV shows around the world 
For example  take something like reading a modern newspaper here in the US  Have
you ever thought about where the letters  the characters on the page are reading 
Where they came from  They were borrowed from another culture may centuries ago 
Then the printing of the words  well  that process was invented in Germany  And
finally the paper itself  paper was invented in China  These innovations from all over
the world were shared across cultures overtime and so today we have newspaper in
the US  So the process of diffusion might take place over long distances and over long
periods of time 

118

?



Now  I am not saying that diffusion happens easily  As I mentioned  sometimes it is
selective  For instance  many people in the US have accepted the practice of
acupuncture  the Chinese practice of using needles to cure a disease or relieve pain 
So lots of people in the US have realized that acupuncture is effective  But few of
them fully understand or have committed themselves to the philosophy behind
acupuncture  Cultures tend to resist ideas which seem too foreign  too different from
their own beliefs and values  But the ideas which aren t perceived as too different are
often incorporated  absorbed  diffused into their culture  So the practice of
acupuncture has been absorbed into US culture  but not the philosophies of Chinese
medicine 

TPO 18
Task 3
Narrator 
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
Jim  you are in the choir  right  What do you think about what they are doing next
year in this article 
Student B 
I really like it 
Student A 
Yeah 
Student B 
Yeah  the new director is right that it will motivate us 
Student A 

119

?



How s that 
Student B 
Well  some of the other schools are really good  So we will really have to work hard
to go up against them 
Student A 
Yeah 
Student B 
I mean  right now we don t rehearse more than once a week   But if we know we
would be competing with other schools  We d probably rehearse more often and
improve our singing a lot 
Student A 
That s true  The more you practice  the better you get  So um  what about what the
article said about how this will help the program 
Student B 
I hope it works  Right now our program is pretty small  but we have some really
talented people  And it will be great to attract even more people 
Student A 
So  how will this plan help 
Student B 
Well  if we go to these off campus events and other people hear us and think we are
really good  we might be able to get some new students interested in coming to this
university  to be part of our music program and perform at our choir concerts 

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor 
Ok  so a good example of this  found right here in North America  is something an
animal called the American pronghorn does  Pronghorns  as you may know  are a
king of deer like animal  They live out on the open grassy plains  somewhat in the
middle of North America  And they are super fast  Pronghorns are in face noted for
being the fastest animal in the western hemisphere  Once a pronghorn starts running 
zoon  none of its present day predator  like the bobcat or coyote  can even hope to
catch up with it  It s off in a flash 
Ok  so why then do pronghorns run so fast  That s the question  Well  it turns out that
quite a long time ag0  I am talking tens of thousands of years things on the grassy
plains used to be very different for the pronghorns  because back then  lions used to
live on the plains  chasing and preying upon the pronghorns  And lions  of course  are
a very swift moving mammal  much faster than the bobcat or coyote or other
predators that you find on the plains today  But now  however  lions are all extinct in
North America  They are no longer a predator of the pronghorn  Tens of thousands of
years ago  though  the lions were there  chasing the pronghorns  so back then  the
pronghorn s speed was critical to its survival

Student A 
Hi  Mat  you got your paper done for class today 
Student B 
No  I just realized it s sitting on my desk  I wrote it last night  but I forgot to bring it
with me 
Student A 
Ah oh  so what are you gonna do 
Student B 
Well  I could drive home and get it  I live off campus  But if I hurry  I d probably get
home and bring the paper back before class was over  You know how strict she is
about late submissions 
Student A 
Yeah  but you d miss part of the class 
Student A 
I know 
Student B 
Maybe you could talk to the professor  Explain what happened and ask him if you
could send it later by email 
Student A 
I know  but I d have to do it after class cause she always starts class right on time 
There wouldn t be time to talk to her until after class 
Student B 
Well  why don t you do that and hope she doesn t consider the paper late 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a business class
Professor 
People who are likely to buy a company s product are called  target customers   And
these target customers influence a company s marketing strategy  In order to develop
a marketing strategy  a company will look at certain characteristics of the target
customers to decide when and where to advertise  so that they ll reach the target
customers most effectively  I d like to talk to you today about two characteristics of
target customers that can influence marketing strategy  specifically age and
geographies location of the target customers 
Say a company makes toy cars  Who are it target customer  Kids  right  So if the
company wants to make sure its television advertising reaches its target customers 
they d want to advertise during times when kids are actually watching television  like
during children s television shows  That way if can make sure that kids see the
advertisements  And that way the company would get people in that age group to go
buy toy cars or to ask their parents to buy them at least 
Now another important characteristic to consider is geographic location  places where
the company s target customers live  Think about a company that makes boats  Its
target customers are people who own homes near oceans or lakes  places where they

121

?



can use boats  After all  people who don t live near water don t have much use for
boats  So by placing advertising on signs along the road or on television in cities and
town that are near oceans or lakes  the company would be more likely to reach the
target customers for its boats and sell more of them as a result

Task 3
Narrator 
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
Did you see this announcement in the newspaper  It sounds like a great idea 
Student B 
You really think so  Not many people even use the place 
Student A 
I know  That s the point  People don t go there because the facilities are old and the
exercises equipment breaks down  I think the director is right that they get more use
out of it this way  Right now the place is usually empty and that s too bad  Students
can get pretty stressed out if they don t get some exercise 
Student B 
That s a good point  But doesn t it seem like a lot of money 
Student A 
It s not really all that much if you figure a lot of people spend that kind of money on a
CD or when the go out of the movies  This is just one charge for the whole year 
Student B 
That s true  And instead of some little thing  we get a recreation center people might
actually use 
Student A 
Right  So considering the benefit  it s really not that much to pay 
Student B 
Yeah  I guess you are right 
Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class
Professor 

122

?



Ok  so an example to illustrate this  You often see this happen in families  Let s say
there are these two kids  a sister and a brother  Let s say the girl is six and the boy is
four  And one day they are all out shopping with their mother and they are in a store 
And the girl sees a toy she wants  She asks her mother to buy it  to buy the toy for her
but the mother says no  So what does the little girl do  She starts crying and
screaming  You know  mommy  I want it  and finally mom gives in and says  ok 
fine  you can have it  and buys the girl the toy  Now don t forget the little brother is
there and he is watching all this happen and maybe he sees this sort of thing happened
a lot as mother giving in when his sister cries and screams  What do you think he is
going to start doing when he wants something from Mom  He will probably cry and
scream  right 
But what if the opposite had happened  Same Mom didn t give in and didn t buy the
girl the toy  In fact  same Mom instead disciplines the girl for screaming and crying 
When they got home  she didn t let the little girl watch her favorite TV program 
Again the little boy is watching  Now what s the little boy likely to do if he finds
himself in a similar situation and he wants Mom to buy him something  Chances are
he is not gonna cry and scream  right

How is it going Mary  Got your schedule all worked out for this semester 
Student B 
It s coming together  Actually I just heard about my student teaching assignment 
Student A 
Teaching assignment  You are student teaching 
Student B 
Yeah  you know I am majoring in education  so one of the requirements is to teach for
a semester in a classroom  usually at the local school in town  We help teach the kids
at school one day a week  I just got my class assignment 
Student A 
Well  that s good 
Student B 
Yeah  but I ve got a scheduling problem 
Student A 
Ah oh 
Student B 
The day I have been assigned to teach at the school in town will be the same day my
Chinese history course meets here at the university 
Student A 
Hmmm  well  could you wait to take the Chinese history course  Sign up for it
another semester or something 
Student B 
Yeah  but this one is taught by Doctor Zhang  He is a visiting professor  He will only
be here one semester  and he is supposed to do be amazing  I am really interested in
the class since I might be visiting China 
Student A 

123

?



Is there another option 
Student B 
Yeah  actually  the teaching assignment is on a day when I will be working with older
kids  teenagers  but the school also needs a student teacher to work in a classroom
with little kids like five and six year olds and it is on a different day when I am free 
So I could do it 
Student A 
So you could change your teaching assignment to a different day 
Student B 
Yeah  It s just that I really want to teach older kids 
Student A 
Oh
Student B 
I am planning on teaching older kids when I graduate  So it would be better
experience for me  for my career 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor 
Today  I want to talk about sea birds  Now sea birds hunt and eat fish and well  their
food can be hard to find because their food sources spread out over a large expanse of
water  So what sea birds have done is that over time they ve mad e adaptation 
They ve developed special characteristics that help them find food 
One adaptation involves the length of the birds  wings  The albatross  for example  is
a large sea bird that spends most its life flying over ocean water in search of food  fish
to feed itself and to carry back to the nest to feed its chicks  Now most birds flap their
wings up and down when they fly  which sues up a lot of energy  But the albatross has
these special long wings that it can hold perfectly still  It s able to fly without moving
its wings up and down  These long wings allow it to glide or float on the wind and
this uses very little energy  This is important because as I said  the albatross has to
cover a huge expanse of ocean to locate food  sometimes up to 11000 miles a day 
Because of its long wings  it can glide along over the ocean using little energy as it
searches for food 
Another important adaptation of many sea birds is an acute highly developed sense of
smell  Take the fulmar  like the albatross  the fulmar needs to find food that s
scattered far out over the ocean  But the fulmar has a rather unusual advantage  It has
tiny tubes inside the nose holes in its beak and these special tube shaped nostrils help
it to pick up the scent of food  Now this highly developed sense of smell is especially
important because the fulmar s main sources of food  plankton  are tiny organisms
that are hard to see  But they give off a very sharp distinctive odor  So when fulmars
are flying around looking for food  they may not be able to see them but they can find
the plankton by smelling them  even from far away

Student A 
Well  those building aren t just used for classes  That s where my evening study
group usually meets 
Student B 
Oh  of course that s true  but you could go to the library instead 
Student A 
Yeah  but the library only has a few rooms that people can use for group meetings 
which is why classrooms have been so convenient  But now if it s winter and cold 
where can we go 
Student B 
Right  in the middle of winter  forget it or even if it s just kind of cold out 
Student A 
It d be pretty unpleasant 
Student B 
But still they obviously have to do something about the situation 
Student A 
Oh  I agree  They have to do something but they should find a solution that isn t so
disruptive to academic nevertheless 
Student B 
Such as 
Student A 
Well  for one if they replaced all those old windows  they are so drafty  they let the
cold in and if they insulated the buildings better  these are really old building  Charing
but 
Student B 
But not at all enegy efficent  Yeah  you are probably right 
Student A 
There are some really basic improvements they could make that d make a huge
difference in the long term that could solve the problem and still leave us somewhere
to study

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a business management class 
Professor 
Ok  so we ve been talking about starting a business  Let s say I want to open up a
pizza restaurant  Well  I know how tough it is to make new business succeed and I
want to a sure thing so I contact a big company that owns a chain of pizza places 
Let s say it s called  pizza town  and I pay for the rights to call my restaurant  pizza
town  and to sell  pizza town  special one of a kind pizza  Now since everyone s
heard of  pizza town   it s really popular  I don t have to worry about whether people
will want to eat my pizza or not  I already know this pizza will sell well because it s a
known thing and that means that there s a better chance my business will succeed 
Now in exchange for being able to call my restaurant  pizza town   I have to agree to
run the business the  pizza town  way  And pizza town trains me to do this  They
show me how to do everything   how to make my pizzas taste like  pizza town 
pizzas  how to advertise  even how to make my store look like a  pizza town   Now
this means that I don t have a lot of freedom of choice in the way I run my business 
but in a lot of way s this is great for me  After all   pizza town  way generally
works    they sell a lot of pizza

What are you going to do

Student A 
Oh  I ve heard of her  Professor Baker is quite famous 
Student B 
Yeah  but I don t know her at all and my research isn t in her area of expertise  She
works with fish  my work  s on mice  not exactly the best match 
Student A 
Well  you get to know her eventually and she s a great biologist so she s still be able
to help you even if your topic isn t exactly her specialty  She may give you some new
perspective on your work 
Student B 
I know  I am considering  but still I am thinking about asking professor Green if he
could agree to advise me long distance 
Student A 
That s a though  You think he will do it 
Student B 
He probably would but I don t know if it s a good idea  I mean he could always look
at my data and read my write ups through my E mail  But the thing is he wouldn t be
here to supervise my experiments 
Student A 
Yeah  well I am sure you ll figure out the best thing to do 
Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class
Professor 
When people are in difficult situations  sometimes they experience feelings of
helplessness or psychological pain  So what ll they do  They unconsciously use
strategies called defense mechanisms to protect themselves psychologically from their
painful emotions 
Let s say a woman has a pet dog  She s had his dog for a long time and he s kept her
company and guarded her for years  But one day he runs away  This woman looks
everywhere and asks other people if they ve seen her do but she just can t find him 
Now she feels helpless and sad because she misses her dog  So she ll unconsciously
find ways to deal with her painful feelings 
One defense mechanism she might use is fantasy  With fantasy  the woman uses her
imagination  So instead of just feeling helpless and sad about her lost dog  she invents
a happy story in her mind  She might imagine that a nice family found him and feels
him and that he is really happy with them  She will picture the dog playing  running
around  having fun  Because of this fantasy  she doesn t have to feel sad about her do
running away  It s a fantasy  It s not real but it keeps her pain away 
Another defense mechanism she might use is what we call sublimation  Sublimation
is different from fantasy because sublimation isn t about pretending  It s about turning
negative emotions into something useful  practical  So the woman might start a dog
training school  That way  by training dogs  perhaps she can help prevent other
people s dogs from running away like hers did  In other words  with sublimation as a

127

?



defense mechanism  the woman redirects her negative feeling about losing her dog
into a positive constructive activity

Really  Why 
Student A 
Well  I just don t think the newspaper gets the most up to date information about
activities 
Student B 
Well  the paper comes out weekly  What s the problem 
Student A 
The fact that it comes out just once a week is the problem  I read the paper every
Monday  But then I forget that they are having a concert or showing a film or
whatever  or like on Thursday or Friday and that ll always give me a reminder  on the
day of the event 
Student B 
Yeah  that way you wouldn t forget 
Student A 
And like if something gets cancelled at the last minute  Well that way you d know
and you wouldn t waste time showing up and no one is there 
Student B 
I haven t thought of that  That would be really helpful  But do you think students are
actually gonna read the E mail 
Student A

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in an education class
Professor 
So I used to teach a class of eight year olds and one problem I sometimes had was
getting the kids to raise their hands when they wanted to answer a question  Like lots
of teachers  I had the rule that if a student wanted to answer a question  they needed to
raise their hand in the air and wait I speak call their name before speaking  That gave
all the students a chance to participate  which helped everyone get more out of the
discussion  But some kids had troubling following the rule  I remember there was on
girl Saran who didn t raise her hand when she wanted to answer a question  She
would just call out the answer and this was frustrating for the other children who were
waiting patiently with their hands raised  So one day when Sarah called out I asked if
she know that calling out was unfair to the other students   I said to her  Sarah  do you
realize that when you call out an answers without raising your hand  you are not being
fair to the other students  You are not giving them a change to answer questions too
and I didn t wait for her to answer  I just continued teaching the class and after that
every time I asked the class a question  Sarah didn t call out the answer  She raised
her hand along with everyone else

the part

Yeah  since it s such a minor role  another actor could probably learn the part in time 
Student B 
That s true  It s just that I don t know how he d feel about that  Removing him from
the play could hurt his feelings and he was really looking forward to being in it 
Student A 
I see  Well  could you  I mean maybe another thing you could do is spend time with
him after rehearsals  You know  work with him to help him learn and remember his
lines 
Student B 
Yeah  I could do that  But there are other parts of the production I try to take care of
after rehearsals so it d take away from other things that I need to do before opening
night 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to a part of a lecture from a history class  The professor is talking about the
industrial revolution
Professor 
Back in the 18th century in a time known as the industrial revolution  some countries 
well  English  in particular  started using new technology like steamed powered
machines to produce goods and the use of these machines brought about some
significant changes 
Let s go over two main changes that occurred  One change was that the center of
production moved from homes to factories  Let s take fabric or clock as an example 
historically  for a very long time  people had made cloth by hand in their homes 
earning a little money from their home based cloth production  But then these new
steamed powered machines for weaving clothe were invented and placed in factories
and these machines could weave cloth much more quickly and efficiently so there
wasn t any reason to keep making cloth slowly in homes when it could be made
fasters on factory machines  Thus the majority of cloth production shifted from
home based businesses to factory production 
Another result of the new technology is that cities started forming around factories 
Like let s say there was a cloth factory that was built in a certain small village  Now
of course the factory needed workers to operate the machines used in cloth production 
So the factory would hire a lot rural workers who would then move from the
countryside to the village  So instead of being spread out all over the countryside  the
workers started to congregate in the village with the factory  As a result  the village
got bigger and bigger and eventually grew into a city

Narrator 
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
So what do you think of this 
Student B 
Well  I think it s a good idea  necessary too 
Student A 
Why is that 
Student B 
Well  you know I ve actually been up to the admissions office a couple of times  like
to pick up some information for a friend  you know and every time I ve ever been
there  wow  you can tell they are really busy 
Student A 
Oh  really 
Student B 
Yeah  those staff members are running around like crazy  on the phone  doing
interviews  dealing with tons of paperwork so I can totally believe that they re saying
about the time factor  Seems like one having one last thing to worry about would be a
good thing 
Student A 
Sounds like it 
Student B 
Yep  oh  and about the other point 
Student A 
The different perspective thing 
Student B 
I think people like us would be really good at this  Unlike  you know I remember
when I was first shown around the campus  they guy leading was  well he was super
nice but there were some questions that he couldn t really answer from experience 
Student A 
Like what 
Student B 

131

?



Well  practical things  which are the noisier dorms or which ones are the quietest 
which student cafeteria he d recommend  Stuff he didn t have first hand knowledge
about  I mean  how could he 
Student A 
I see  Our point of view might be helpful 
Task 4
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture from the psychology class 
Professor 
So I have a personal example  Some years back  my wife and I were looking for a
house to by  We found this great old house out in the country but my wife hand her
doubts about it  She noticed the house wasn t in very good condition  It was a little
rundown and probably needed some repairs but I really fell in love with the
architecture of the house  The unusual way it was designed and built so I convinced
my wife that we can hire people to fix it up and you know make the house nice  We
decided to buy it and live there after repairs were finished 
Well  the workers we hired to repair the house soon discovered things were worse
than I though  It turned out that the roof was damaged and needed expensive repairs 
After the roof was repaired  the works discovered that the house had electrical
problems  most if the wiring was bad and would have to be replaced at a huge cost 
Well  at this point my wife reminded me of her earlier doubts about the house and
wondered if we could ever get it into shape but I just became more determined than
ever  I paid for all the wiring to be replaced by an electrician  But it gets worse  the
electrician noticed that insects hand eaten into some of the walls and they would also
have to be torn out and replaced  This was going to be more expensive than all the
other repairs but by this point I felt determined to keep going  I kept thinking I have to
do it  If I stopped now  my wife will think I was wrong for not following her advice 
Task 5
Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between two students 
Student A 
Hey Jane  did you finish your research paper for class 
Student B 
Yeah  I printed it out this morning 
Student A 
Why do you look so worried then 
Student B 
Well  I was just in the cafeteria eating lunch and reading it over one last time and I
spilled some soup on it and the class starts in fifteen minutes 
Student A 
How bad is it 
Student B 
It s not huge but you can definitely see it and several of the pages got wet 
Student A 
What are you gonna do 

132

?



Student B 
I could just go ahead and handed it in like this and explain to the professor what
happened  I mean you can still read the paper and the page should dry out a little by
the time class begins  But there will still be sort of sticky and wrinkled 
Student A 
Well  not all professors care that much about how the paper looks at least it d be in on
time 
Student B 
I know  it s just professor Adams is kind of strict when it come to handing in our
research paper  I mean the format she gave us for putting this paper together was
really specific  so the way it looks seems important 
Student A 
Well  how about going to the computer lab to print anther copy 
Student B 
I could  Then I d have a clean copy to hand in and I wouldn t have to worry about
how the paper looks 
Student A 
You d better hurry though because there s usually a line over there 
Student B 
I know  And by the time I get there  wait in line for a computer  print the paper out
and come back to class  I d be late for class and Professor Adams is strict about
lateness too 
Student A 
I see what you mean 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor 
Many animals live underground in the soil not just little animals like worms but also
bigger animals like mammals  Living underground has advantages  It protects animals
from aboveground predators  However  the underground environment also presents
challenges and animals that live underground have developed physical adaptations to
deal with them 
One challenge is well  simply how to move underground through the dirt  Another
challenge for the animals is to protect vulnerable parts of its body from the
environment that it s moving through  Now moving through soil is not like moving
through air or water because soil  earth is thick and dense  so animals that live
underground have evolved physical features that help them move through dirt
efficiently 
For example  the mole  a small furry mammal has really wide super strong front feet
with big claws  The mole s feet act like shovels so it can dig through the dire  the
claws cut into the dirt  loosen it up and then once the dirt is loosened up  the broad
feet throw the dirt behind the mole as it moves forward  These shovel like front feet
allow a mole to dig its way through the dirt astonishingly quickly  But even for an
animal that can move efficiently through the dirt  living underground can still be
problematic because it s easy for particles to get caught in sensitive parts of the
animal s body  Like for mammals in their eyes  so underground animals have
developed adaptations to prevent this 

133

?



Again let s make the example of the mole  TO begin with  moles have tiny eyes and
these eyes are covered with a thick skin  a protective membrane that actually got hair
on it  These hairs protect the mole s eyes from dirt particles  so as the mole goes
digging through the dirt with its hair pushed forward  the dirt particles come into
contact with the hairy membrane covering the mole s tiny eyes and the particles just
slide by  don t get caught in the mole s eyes  So the eyes  the mole s sensitive parts
are protected

Task 3
Narrator 
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
Student A 
Hey  what do you think of this 
Student B 
You mean the editor s decision 
Student A 
Right 
Student B 
Oh  I think they are right  It s the thing to do 
Student A 
Really  Why 
Student B 
Well  hardly anyone reads that section 
Student A 
You don t think so 
Student B 
Not really  I mean they only cover a couple of stories and most people already know
about them before they even get around to reading the campus paper 
Student A 
True  if you get the local paper  or use the internet  you already know about the major
stories 
Student B 
Exactly  And the coverage is better  I think we should just stick with campus news
and stuff 
Student A 

134

?



So do you think what they are gonna replace it with is better 
Student B 
Definitely  Right now how do you learn about what s happening on campus 
Student A 
Mostly from posters in the different buildings or in the student center 
Student B 
Right  The information is everywhere  But it s hard to keep track of it  I see stuff
posted but then I forget about it half the time 
Student A 
So you are saying with this new section…
Student B 
You could just cut it out from the newspaper and carry it round and check it anytime
and know what s taking place  when and where 
Task 4
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a sociology class on this topic 
Professor 
I have an example from my own life that illustrates this  When I first began my
university studies  I became friends with a bunch of art students  They were older and
fun and very creative and I thought they were really cool and they all liked to dress
really casually in T shirts and jeans and sneakers  That s what they wore all the time 
to class  to the library  to dinner  T shirts and jeans and sneakers  So that s what I
started wearing too and I fit right in and I felt really cool 
But then I graduated  moved to Chicago and got a job and I started working with
some really bright young people who d already been working at the company for a
few years  who were already handling major responsibilities for the company  really
impressive and sometimes some of us would get together on the weekend  maybe for
a concert or baseball game or something  And at first I just wear a T shirt and jeans
and sneakers  That was  you know  how I was used to dressing  But I soon noticed
that my co workers prefer to dress up a little bit  The men would wear a nice pair of
pants  bottom up shirt  the woman might wear a fashionable dress and some nice
shoes  They dressed in clothes a lot nicer than what I was used to wearing  And I
started thinking  you know  that looks really classy  really sharp  And So I started to
dress the same way they did  You know  nicer and a little more formal  And  I don t
know  my T shirt  jeans and sneakers didn t seem as cool to me anymore 
Task 5
Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between two students
Student A 
How s it going Mike 
Student B 
Ok  I am just trying to figure out what to do about this new bus schedule 
Student A 
New bus schedule 
Student B 

135

?



Yeah  I take a bus from campus to my job downtown  I work there Tuesday
afternoons but the bus schedule changed  The bus I was taking is leaving earlier now
and I can t get to it in time because I ve got chemistry class then 
Student A 
Yeah  they do change the bus schedule sometimes  It s inconvenient  So what are you
gonna do 
Student B 
Well  I talked to my boss and she said I could change my work hours and work at
night instead  I start in the late afternoon and then work till around midnight and there
is a bus that ll get me there on time 
Student A 
That sounds good  So you can just take a later bus to your job 
Student B 
Yeah  The only thing is if I work late at night  I will be really tired and I have class early the

Student A 
Yeah  but do you have any other choice 
Student B 
Well  yeah another option is just to ride my bike to work after chemistry  I ll be able
to get to work on time so I can keep same hours  It s not that far and it ll take about
fifteen minutes 
Student B 
Hum  that might be nice because you get some exercise  but it would be
uncomfortable riding a bike on days when there is bad weather 
Student A 
Yeah  I ll have to think about it 
Task 6
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
Professor 
Now  plants  like animals and like us for that matter  need nutrients  substances that
provide nourishment to survive  thrive and grow  We get our nutrients from the food
we eat  Plants  though  most plants anyway  absorb their nutrients from the soil  right 
through their root systems  Ok  but there are plants that don t get their nutrients from
the soil  The places they grow  the soil is bad  So they get their nutrients from insects
instead  from trapping and digesting insects  They re called carnivorous plants 
Carnivorous plants capture insects in different ways  They have different trapping
mechanisms   active traps and passive traps 
A plant with an active trap  a good example is the Venus fly trap  The Venus fly trap
actually moves to catch its prey or parts of it will do anyway  Its leaves  it has special
leaves that are hinged in the middle  the two halves of the leaves open and close  sort
of like a mouth to catch insects and on these leaves is a sweet nectar that attracts
insects  Insects like this sweet stuff and when they get lured in and land on the leaf 
wham  the leaves spring shut  It s an active trap and the insect springs it  so to speak 
The leave quickly closes and forms a little cage  trapping the insect between the
leaves  The Venus fly trap is then able to digest the insect and get its nutrients 

136

?



But other carnivorous plants  their methods are passive  they don t have any moving
parts to trap things  they have passive traps like the sundew plant  The sundew plant
also produces sweet nectar that attracts insects  Its leaves are full of little hairs that
secrete the sweet substance  But what happens when insects land on the sundew s
leaves to get at this sweet nectar  Well  unfortunately for the insects  the hairs on the
leaves also produce a super sticky glue like substance so an insect gets stuck in them
and can t get away  It basically gets glued there  allowing the sundew to digest it and
absorb nutrients

Absolutely  In fact  I actually prefer it to the library as the place to study  and a lot of
other students do too  We even study for our final exam there  and you can eat there
while at work  something you cannot do in the library 
Student B 
Ok  but you don t actually like the food  do you  I mean  he says…

Task 4
Narrator 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in an environmental science class 
Professor 
So  one example of this is the macaw  the great green macaw  Now  the great green
macaw is a beautiful bird  a fairly large size parrot known for its colorful feathers 
gorgeous green feathers  with some red and blue feathers too  The macaw  lives in the
south American rain forest  in a part of the rain forest where a lot of trees have been
cut down  trees that the macaw relys on for its food and nesting  So the macaw was in
trouble  And of course  along with the trees  a lot of other animals were in trouble too 
Lots of birds  bets and frogs  also live in these trees  So when the trees were cut down
and cleared away  these animals also didn t have a place to live in any more and their
population drastically declined 
So what concerned the group of people in that area did was they started spreading the
word about how the macaw  you know  this really beautiful bird  needed help  They
made little books with information about the macaw  with pictures  four colored
pictures of macaw that showed off its beautiful feathers  And they passed out these
books  the informational brochures  they distributed them to people in schools  in
community centers in the area  and a lot of people responded  they contributed money
and help the group set up some protected land  a special area where no one could cut
down the tree  so the macaw would be safe  and the macaw s population started to
increase  and other bird  bets and frogs  came back to the area too  Their numbers
increased along with the trees

What s that 
Student B 
Well  I don t have the internet connection in my new apartment so I cannot use the
computer to access to the internet from my room 
Student A

Right  I need it to do the research for classes  email people  stuff like that  I use it
almost every day 
Student A 
So are you going to pay and get it installed in your apartment 
Student B 
I ve called a couple of internet companies in the area and it is no trouble for them to
send someone else to my apartment to install internet service  It s just the cost  I have
to pay every month of the service 
Student A 
Well  you know there is always a computer center on campus  The computers there
have free internet access  Couldn t you use them 
Student B 
I could  it s just that I don t have classes every day  so I d have to go campus on
someday just to use the internet and that computer center can get crowded sometimes 
Student A 
Emm……
Student B 
SO  I am not sure what to do 
Task 6
Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in the literature class 
Professor 
Authors of fiction  um  short stories and novels  of course have many decisions to
make when they are writing their works  One of those decisions is how they are going
to narrate  or tell the story  what perspective or what point of view the story will be
told from  So authors need to choose a type of narrator  some person or voice to tell
the story  And this narrator can affect the readers  experience when they read a story 
Now  the author might choose to have an objective narrator  An objective narrator can
describe what people  uh  the characters in the story  what they do and what they say 
But that s not all  So suppose we have a story  for example  that s about a man and
woman about to take a trip  When the story is told by an objective narrator  the only
information that we get as readers is what the characters say to each other  what they
do  They get on the train  they sit down  they look out the window  That s all  And
this leads questions that force the reader to interpret the events  to fill in information
and decide what the characters  conversation and action might mean 
Another kind of narrator an author might use is an omniscient narrator  In this case 
the narrator  the voice that s telling the story  knows everything  And I mean
everything about the characters  So let s imagine our  say  man and woman travelling 
but described by an omniscient narrator  Not only do we  the readers  know what they

139

?



do and say  but we also know what they are thinking  For example  we are told that
the couple is going to visit an old friend of the man s  And we learn what the man is
thinking  that he is nervous because he hasn t seen his friend in a long time  that he is
worried if his wife will like the friend  So an omniscient narrator provides more
information and answers questions that the reader might have about the characters or
the action 

TPO 25

Task3 
Now listen to two students discussing the article 
 woman 
You know  I wish they wouldn t do this 
 man 
Why 
 woman 
Well  I think it s unnecessary  I mean  as far as the first reason goes  Yeah  sure  it
takes a long time to have everyone receive their diploma individually  especially now
that there are more students  but there s an easy way to make it shorter 
 man 
What s that 
 woman 
Reduce the number of speeches  I mean  a lot of people give speeches  students 
professors  administrators  the president of the university  Do we really need that
many speeches 
 man 
Probably not  and a lot of the speeches are pretty boring anyway  so  yeah  we
probably could cut out a few 
 woman 
Yeah  and I don t think their second reason s very good either  about the space 
 man 
How s that 
 woman 
The problem isn t the size of the hall  It s that they allow students to invite too many
people to come and watch  All they need to do is reduce the number of guests each
graduating student gets to invite 
 man 
Yeah  I guess that could solve the problem 
 woman 
Yeah  I mean  right now each graduating student can invite up to ten people  That s
too many  At most schools  students only get to invite like four or five people  It we
just said   OK  you can only invite six people   That ll still be more than most other
schools and the ceremony could stay the way it is

Now listen to part of a lecture from a sociology class 
 male professor 
Now  the invention of the telephone was revolutionary  It was a much easier and faster
way of communicating than anything else available at the time  However  when the
telephone first became widely available  towards the end of the 19th century  only
businesses used telephones because businesses realized how the telephone could
benefit them  how it could help them be more productive 
But  a lot of people in the general public didn t think the phone should be used for
personal communication  Some people didn t like to listen to someone s voice
without being able to see them  Also  a lot of people thought that it was rude to call
someone on the telephone instead of visit them in person  They missed the sense of
personal connection they got from meeting someone 
However  as we all know  people gradually changed their minds about the telephone 
It took about 30 years but eventually most homes came to have telephones and
everyone came to depend on them  Talking to someone you couldn t see began to
seem more normal  Friends began to call each other just to chat  just for fun  And after
everyone agreed on certain rules of politeness  such as not calling someone late at
night  no one considered it rude anymore to make personal phone calls 
Task5

Oh  really 
 man 
Yeah 
 woman 
Does this mean you ll be living by yourself next semester 
 man 
Yeah  but that s OK cause I really want to live alone next semester anyway  I have to
concentrate on my senior project for the history department  I have a lot to write and I
don t want any distractions  The only major problem  though  is how I ll be getting to
campus 
 woman 
Oh  yeah 
 man 
See  the apartment s a little far from campus and Jim has a car and he gives me rides
to and from campus everyday  But I can t afford a car now 
 woman 
So have you thought about taking public transportation  uh  the bus to campus 
 man 
Yeah  I have  The thing is that there s no bus going directly to campus from that part
of town  I d have to change buses a couple of times on the way 
 woman 
I see  That could take a lot of time 
 man 

141

Right 
 woman 
Hmm  well  maybe you should move back into a dormitory on campus  Request a
single room  There s lots of them 
 man 
Yeah  I thought about that  You know  I could live alone and get my work done but  I
don t know  I would miss my apartment 
 woman 
I know  but you ve got to make some choice 
Task6 
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class 
 female professor 
Rocks near the Earth s surface are directly exposed to elements in the environment
such as air and water  and also to conditions such as temperature change as well as to
living organism  And this exposure to the environment can actually cause even huge
rocks to break into smaller pieces  This process is called weathering  Let s talk about a
couple ways weathering occurs 
First of all  rocks are often exposed to water  In cold wet environments rocks can
break due to water freezing inside of them  How does this happen  Well  as I am sure
you know  when water freezes it expands and over time this can lead to weathering 
Um  imagine a rock with a small opening or crack in it  It rains and water gets into the
crack and stays there 
Then  at night  the temperature drops and water inside the crack freezes  This growing 
expanding ice pushes outward on either side of the crack causing it to get slightly
bigger  When this happens again and again  the crack becomes larger and eventually
pieces of the rock break off 
OK  weathering can also be caused by plants  by a plant growth  If a plant seed gets
blown into the crack of a rock  it may take root  And its root will grow down into the
rock  The plant s roots can cause the rock to break down  uh  fracture  You may have
seen this with large trees growing on top of a rock  a great example of this  Usually
there s enough dirt in a crack of a rock or on top of a rock to allow a tree to start
growing there  As the tree grows over the years  the tree s roots extend downward into
the crack and crevasses of the rock in search of water and nutrients  Over time  the
roots get bigger and grow deeper  widening and enlarging the cracks  causing the rock
to break apart 

TPO 26

Task3 
Now listen to two students discussing the letter 
 man 
Did you see this letter 
 woman 
Yeah  why 

142

?



 man 
Well  I don t agree  It s definitely not the same thing to just go on the university s Web
site 
 woman 
You don t think so 
 man 
No  I mean  sure  the basic information is there  but that s not all advisors help you
with  Sometimes there re different ways you can meet a requirement for graduation 
like  different classes you can take  And if you talk to someone  they can help you
figure it out 
 woman 
And you can t get that from just reading what s on the Web site 
 man 
Right  advisors have a lot of expert information so they make it easier for you to see
what your choices are 
 woman 
I see what you mean 
 man 
And as for scheduling meetings  I ve never had that kind of trouble 
 woman 
Me neither 
 man 
So anyone who does have problems must be waiting to the last minute to set
something up 
 woman 
That s possible 
 man 
I mean  the thing is  if you call or go to the office early enough to set up an
appointment  schedules are open  It s just that if you wait till the last possible day  it ll
be harder cause they already have lots of students scheduled then 
Task4 
Now listen to part of a lecture from a biology class 
 male professor 
OK  so a good example of this type of plant  common to the rainforest  is the Urn
plant  The Urn plant wraps its roots around the branches of the trees or sometimes
around the trunk near the upper part of the tree  They use the tree for support and this
allows them to reside high in the trees  in the canopy  where they can get plenty of
sunlight 
Now  the Urn plant has a unique shape  It got its name because of the formation of its
leaves creates a kind of urn or bowl where it can store water  The Urn plant has rather
long stiff spiky leaves  The leaves are slightly overlapping and are tightly rolled into a
kind of cone shape or a funnel shape  Its flowers are held on a single stem in the
center  Anyway  as I mentioned  the arrangement of the leaves forms a kind of
receptacle or bowl at the base so that it is rainwater collects on the leaves it rolls down
into the bowl where it can be stored 
OK  so its unique shape helps it gather and store water  It also helps to gather other
nutrients  This is because insects  dead leaves from other plants or other debris land
on the leaves and then get washed down into the stored water  Gradually they
decompose  The chemical break down creates a nitrogen rich food source in the

143

?



stored water  So  the water supply contains a kind of liquid fertilizer that can be
released to the plant whenever it needs the food

something fun for people to do in the middle of the week 
 man 
Yeah  that s true  It s just that  well  there ll probably be a smaller audience on a
Wednesday which might be kind of disappointing 
 woman 
Well  yeah
 man 
But there is one other option  We re friends with people in another band  They re
gonna be performing in the auditorium next Saturday  And they actually said they d
be willing to let us perform with them 
 woman 
Wow  That s really nice of them 
 man 
Yeah  we d play for a little while and then they d play the rest of the night as
scheduled 
 woman 
Sounds good 
 man 
Yeah  only catch is we wouldn t have much time to perform so we wouldn t be able to
do all the songs we ve been preparing

Listen to part of a lecture from a business class 
 female professor 
Consumers are buying a product  most of the time they re not buying just the product
itself  they re also buying the container the product comes in  So the design of the
container is very important  It can be the deciding factor when consumers are trying to
decide which brand of the product to buy  So  let s talk about a couple of ways
product containers can be designed to appeal to consumers 
One important design goal is to make the container as user friendly as possible  as
convenient to use as possible  Take  for example  when companies started using
plastic containers for condiments such as ketchup  mustard and mayonnaise  In the
past  these products came in glass containers with lids you had to screw off  And then
you had to either pour the ketchup or mustard on your food which could be messy or
scoop it out with spoon  But flexible plastic containers were much more convenient to
use and so they were more attractive to consumers  You just held the container over
your food  gave it a little squeeze and out came the ketchup or mustard  uh  much
faster and easier than having to remove a lid first 
Another important design goal is to give the container a pleasing appearance so that
consumers will feel comfortable displaying it in their homes  Take  for example  a
company that sells cookies  Instead of selling their cookies in a plain cardboard box 
they might sell them in a nice metal box  And they might decorate that nice metal box
with beautiful pictures of some kind  That way when consumers present the cookies
to guests  for example  they look nice  they look classic  Attractive containers like that
can make a product much more appealing to consumers

Now listen to two students discussing the article 
 woman  Oh  no  did you see this 
 man  Yeah  why  You don t like the idea 
 woman  Not at all 
 man  How come 
 woman  Well  the cost  for one thing  they are just not being realistic 
 man  Even compare to the price of textbooks 
 woman  Well  sure  textbooks aren t cheap  but do you think people are only gonna
use one device the whole time they are at university  What happens if yours breaks 
You have to buy a new one  Or they come out with some fancy new features 
Wouldn t you want to get a new one then 
 man  Yeah  I see what you mean  A lot of people would probably want to replace
theirs with the latest version 
 woman  Right  Maybe even every year and that can add up 
 man  True  but  don t you agree it ll make studying and preparing for classes a lot
easier 
 woman  I don t think everybody is gonna think it s so great 
 man  What do you mean 

145

?



 woman  Well   it s only helpful if it s easy to use and  well  this thing is pretty small 
It s only about 18 or 20 centimeters tall 
 man  Oh  really  So that means the screen s pretty small 
 woman  Right  and I heard that the key pad or control buttons  they are small  too  So
if you have normal sized fingers  it s not so easy to select an item or get it to function
right  you know  to do stuff like highlighting or underlining 
 man  I hadn t thought of that 
 woman  So what good are all those fancy features if it s hard to use them  Besides  I
like the old fashioned way of studying material  writing notes on the page and
underlining or highlighting important sections of the book  I m more comfortable
with that 
Task4 
Now listen to a lecture on this topic in a biology class 
 male professor 
OK  we can see a great example of this with ants  Ants live in large groups called
colonies  They normally move together to get to food sources  And sometimes when
the ants are moving toward food source  they ll encounter  find an obstacle in their
path  So  for instance  let s say a large number of ants are walking on a tree toward
some food on a branch  But when they reach the end of the branch they are walking
on  there s a wide space between that branch and the next one  the branch with the
food on it  Now  none of these ants alone can cross this wide space to get to the other
branch with the food  So  how did they solve this problem 
Here s how  one ant walks forward until it reaches the end of the branch and then
automatically holds onto the branch with its back legs  Then it stretches its body
forward into the open space  Now  this comes naturally to ants and it s a simple action 
So then the next ant walks to the end of the branch and right across the first ant s body 
Then it holds onto the first ant and then it stretches its body out into the open space 
just a little bit closer to the branch with the food on it 
Then  one after another  other ants do the same thing until enough ants connect
together to form a bridge between the two branches  Pretty amazing  huh  The
connected ants hold this position allowing the rest of the ants in the group to cross
over this bridge of ants to reach the food

 man  Hi  Nancy  is something the matter 
 woman  Oh  I just realized that I ve got a scheduling conflict tomorrow 
 man  What is it 
 woman  Well  the poetry class I m teaching meets at 4 o clock  My students have a
test next week so tomorrow s class is the review session  It s important 
 man  OK 
 woman  The other thing is my cousin s retirement party  But I just realized it also
starts at 4 o clock  I haven t realized it was starting at the exact same time as my
class 
 man  Oh  no  Well  I m free tomorrow at 4  if you want  I could cover your class for
you  Lead the review session 
 woman  Really  What a generous offer 
 man  I wouldn t mind  I mean  I haven t taught poetry for a few years  I am a little
rusty 

146

?



 woman  Well  I have some materials prepared and you could certainly use them  So it
might be tough but you could do it 
 man  I ll try anyway 
 woman  Well  my other option is to go to the class  Do the review session myself and
arrive late at the retirement party 
 man  So you could prepare your students for the test yourself 
 woman  I could and I know it d be good for my students  It s just that I d miss a lot
of the party  My cousin and some others are giving speeches and I think it ll be really
interesting  It ll be a shame to miss it

two solutions form the conversation you would recommend  Explain the reasons for
your recommendation

Listen to part of a lecture in a history class 
 female professor 
So  most cities of the ancient world tended to be small  often limited to the banks of a
river  They had very little means to expand  These old cities couldn t really cross
natural barriers like rivers or be located very far from water sources  But Roman cities 
on the other hand  grew much larger  How did this happen  Well  for one thing  the
Romans had more advanced technology  Let s look at a couple of Roman
developments that allowed its cities to expand 
One development that ll allow Roman cities to grow was their advanced building
materials  The Romans developed a special kind of concrete  a building material that
would harden under water  And this concrete made new kinds of structures possible 
Take their bridges for example  Because of this special concrete  they could build
better bridges  bridges that could go across wide rivers  bridges that were big enough
to transport equipment and materials with wagons and carts  So with these strong
bridges  Roman cities could grow on both sides of the river  creating larger cities than
would have been possible otherwise 
Another development that helped Roman cities expand was an improved way to move
fresh clean water  People need access to fresh water and the Romans created an
especially effective way to bring it to them  They built structures called aqueducts 
Now  aqueducts are series of open channels  waterways that stretch from water
sources high in the mountains to cities  They were carefully planned and built so the
steady drop in altitude provides the steady flow of water to cities  These aqueducts
could move tremendous amount of water over great distances and even bring fresh
water to places far from rivers  Because of this  people could have clean water for
drinking and bathing without being located near a river  So cities were able to grow
larger in new locations

 woman   Jim  did you see this letter in the paper today 
 man   Yeah  I did  123
 woman   That would be great for us music students  Because I mean  what happens is 
students keep practicing in the dorm room because they don t have anywhere else
they can go 
 man   Yeah  I ve done that myself a bunch of times playing my violin 
 woman   Me too  and I always feel kind of bad about it  because even if you try to
keep the volume down  it s still pretty noisy  and other students are nearby in their
rooms trying to sleep or study 
 man   That s true 
 woman   And we really could use more time slots  especially just before the big
concerts  the winter concert and the spring concert  because everybody from all
sections of the orchestra needs to practice then 
 man   I know  I tried to make a reservation to practice before the winter concert  but I
couldn t  because other people from the orchestra had already booked every single
time slot 
 woman   Exactly  so this would really help 
Task4 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a business class

All right  so I actually saw a good example of this just the other day  I watched an
advertisement on television about a well known companies pots and pans  and in the
advertisement there was a woman  a professional cook  talking about how she uses the
companies pots and pans in her own kitchen  Now the woman in the advertisement
began by saying that this company s pots and pans were expensive  She just came
right out and admitted to the audience that they cost a lot more than most other
companies pots and pans  And she also said that she realized that when people went
shopping for new cookware  they might feel that they just didn t want to spend all that
money on such expensive pots and pans since there were so many in the store that
cost a lot less 
But then  she went on to explain that the extra cost was worthwhile  because  although
these pots and pans cost more to begin with  they actually saved you money in the
long run  How  Well  they came with a special lifetime warranty  which meant that
the company would replace them free if anything ever went wrong  and that s
something most companies that make pots and pans couldn t say about their products 
Task5 
Listen to a conversation between two students 
 woman   Hey mike  did you finish that article you were writing for the campus
newspaper  The one about the school play 
 man   Not yet  Remember how I was going to interview the student who s directing
it 
 woman   Yeah  you said that was going to be a big part of the article 
 man   Right  And I was going to make my article about what the director said  since
she knows about picking the play  choosing the cast  designing the set…everything 
But I just called and it turns out that she s got a bad cold…she s sick 
 woman   So you can t interview her 
 man   Not today…no…but I have a couple of options  I could wait until she feels
better  and interview her then…it s just that then the article wouldn t be done in time
to go in this week s paper 

148

?



 woman   Oh…so you d have to put it in next week s paper then 
 man   Yeah  and the play s opening this weekend…I mean  it s running next weekend
too  but it d make more sense to have the article come out before the play opens 
 woman   I see what you mean  So  what s your other option 
 man   Well…I could interview an actor instead of the director  I talked with one of
the lead actors  and he said he d be happy to do an interview today 
 woman   Sounds good  Then your article would come out before the play opens 
 man   I know  but it s just that he probably wouldn t have as much to say as the
director  I mean  he wouldn t know about everything that went into planning the play
the way the director does 
Task6 
Listen to part of a lecture from a geology class 
 female professor 
So  when we look at lakes  they seem to be permanent  we assume they ll be around
forever  But in fact  lakes aren t permanent  they can actually disappear  Sometimes
they disappear through natural processes  and sometimes because of human activities 
First let s look at one way that lakes can disappear naturally  and that is  by gradually
getting filled in with organic sediment  This often happens with lakes that have lots of
plants growing in them  When the plants die  they break down into a muddy substance 
which falls to the bottom of the lake  they re then replaced by new plants  which
eventually also die and fall to the bottom  And over the years  all this dead plant
material builds up on the bottom of the lake  and as builds up  it starts to fill up the
lake  and there s less and less room for water  and eventually the lake gets completely
filled in  and disappears 
OK  lakes can also disappear  pretty rapidly sometimes  as a result of human activities 
For example  we know that farmers need water to irrigate their crops  And sometimes
to get that water  they pump that water out of a nearby lake  They install pipes that run
from the lake to their farms  and they pump the water out of the lake and into their
fields  Now that s ok if the lake is continually being refilled with rainwater or with
water from streams that run into the lake  but if there isn t enough rainwater or stream
water to replace the water the farmers take out of the lake  the lake will eventually dry
up 

TPO 29

Task3 
Now listen to two students discussing the letter 
 woman  He s totally right about this  you know 
 man  Well  I agree they should do it  but maybe it s not fair 
 woman  What  Just assuming no one wants them  Well  judging from the conditions
some of them are in  I think it s probably a safe assumption  I mean  some are missing
parts like handlebars or wheels  and others are really rusty like they ve been left
outside in the rain for years 
 man  Yeah  the ones with missing parts sure don t look like they are being used but
what if some are

 woman  Well  to be sure  the university could always attach notes to them and say
give the owners two weeks to remove them or they d be removed by campus security 
 man  Yeah  that ll probably work 
 woman  Anyway  it ll be really big help if they were gone 
 man  Oh  I know
 woman  Because  I mean  especially like in front of the dining hall  there are lots of
them there and it can be really hard to find a space  All the spaces are always taken
there 
 man  Yeah  it s bad  Lots of people ride bikes these days 
 woman  And since the university doesn t allow us to tie them to signposts  or fences
or anything like that to park them  I always have to lock mine up in another building
and walk over to the dining hall cause there s hardly ever a space 
Task4 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a biology class 
 male professor 
OK  so we sometimes see this with animals that live in parts of the world where it
gets very cold in the winter  For example  in the northeaster United States  there s a
species of squirrels that does this  This squirrel  like many species of squirrel  loves to
eat nuts  Nuts are one its primary sources of food  Now  nuts are very difficult to find
in the winter  But in the autumn  they are lying all over the place because that s when
they fall from the trees 
So  what this squirrel does is in the autumn it spends a lot of time finding nuts  After it
finds a nut  it prepares it  It takes off the outer shell and cleans it  This preparation
may in some way help preserve the nut and or may make it easier to eat later on  The
squirrel then digs a little hole in the ground and buries the nut  In one autumn  this
squirrel may bury hundreds of nuts 
But it doesn t just dig a big hole and put all the nuts in it and cover them up  No  it
digs hundreds of holes all over the place  And it puts just one nut in each hole  Now 
why would it do that  Well  probably primarily because even if other animals happen
to find some of the holes  some of the nuts  the squirrel will still have a lot of other
holes with nuts in them so it ll still have enough food to survive the winter

a question and answer session afterward  where the professor and other students ask

me questions about my history paper and stuff 
 man  Well  I bet if you told your professor what happened  how the flight was
delayed and you didn t get any sleep  I bet your professor would let you do the
presentation on a different day 
 woman  Yeah  she d probably let me reschedule  I just don t know if I want to put it
off  I ve got a lot of other stuff coming up  big assignments 
 man  Oh 
 woman  I could just give the presentation today  I mean  I did prepare a lot for it last
week  So  I don t know  maybe I should just grab a cup of coffee or something and go
through with it

Task6 
Listen to part of a lecture in a business class 
 female professor 
OK  so  of course  businesses want to sell as many of their products as possible  Often
a business sells mostly one type of product  But sales of this product may stop
increasing because most potential customers have already bought it  In this situation 
many companies will try to diversify  um  to develop or diverse product in order to
increase sales  There are a couple of efficient ways that a company 130
can diversify using some of their existing resources 
One way a company can diversify is to use an existing technology  uh  technology
that they already have to develop a new product  If a company already has some
machines and technology to make a certain product  sometimes it can efficiently use
that same technology to make a different product  For example  a company that makes
televisions might start making computer monitors because the technology used to
make these two products is very similar  So the company can use its existing
technological resources to make the monitors  But with the monitors  it can reach new
customers  people that wouldn t buy television screens  like businesses that need to
buy monitors for their employees  computers 
Another way a company can diversify is to try to appeal to its existing customers  its
customer base with a new product  One of a company s most important resources is
its existing customers and these customers might have other needs that the company
could fulfill with a different product  For example  a company that sells skis might
have a large customer base that enjoys winter sports like skiing down snowy
mountains  So they might start making ski jackets  The same customers that buy skis
would also need warm ski jackets to wear while they are skiing  And since they like
the company s skis  they might be more likely to buy the jackets with the company s
name on them

Man  So you think it s true  What he says about the problems about the way it s being
done 
Woman  Yeah  I do  Take his first reason  Like  I know you don t drive  but I do drive
here every day  so I need a place to park my car  And remember last year when they
decided to repair some of the parking lots 
Man  Oh yeah  I remember that  there was a lot of work going on  wasn t there 
Starting in December 
Woman  Right  at least four lots were closed  and that meant there weren t enough
parking spots for students and professor s cars  I usually had to circle around looking
for parking on one of the streets  And then walk from the street all the way to my
classes 
Man  That s annoying 
Woman  Yeah  and it happened to a lot of other people in my classes too  People were
always arriving late because of the trouble they had parking  Sometimes even my
professors were late 
Man  Yeah 
Woman  And also  his second point  That makes sense too  I mean  for instance  part
of the reason those parking lot repairs last year took so long was because of the big
snowstorms  They had to keep stopping  sometimes for a week or two at a time 
because of snow and ice on the ground
Man  Yeah  I remember that  we had a bunch of snowstorms in a row last year 
Woman  Yeah  so with all that starting and stopping cause of the weather  the problem
took them a lot longer to finish

the argument  which wasn t like her at all  But then  my daughter stopped  and
thought about why she was so upset  She realized her reaction was inappropriate  and
she also realized she wasn t really upset with her friend…there was something else
bothering her 
See  she d just gotten this summer job as a camp counselor for children  and she was
feeling a lot of worry and stress about how well she would do  she said she d never
worked with children before  so she figured out that she wasn t upset about what
movie to watch with her friend  but about starting her new job  She really wanted it to
go well  She wanted the kids to like her  And when she understood this  she stopped
arguing with her friend  and apologized to her  She told her friend how anxious she
felt about starting the job  and how sorry she was about getting upset with her  and her
friend encouraged her  saying she d do great at the job 
So my daughter felt better  and they relaxed and had fun together  same as always

and you ve already been waiting 15 minutes for her  I mean…maybe you should just
go by yourself 
Woman  You mean  just leave now  without her  Yeah  I guess she could see it another
time  They are showing the film again tomorrow  so Amy could still go see it then  but
I ll be busy tomorrow  so I need to go today 
Man  Maybe you could just leave Amy a voicemail saying that you had to leave
without her 
Woman  That s true  but…I don t know  maybe I should just wait 10 more minutes
and go late to the film  She might be on her way over here right now  She did mention
that she had a lot of other things to do first before she met me…and besides  Amy s
often late for stuff

Task6 
Listen to part of a lecture from a Biology class 
When we humans walk from place to place  we move on the Earth s surface  across
the Earth s surface  Many animals of course do the same thing  Horses and dogs and
cows and so on  all move on the surface  across the surface of the Earth  There are
also  there are quite a few animals that have the ability to move from place to place
underground  beneath the Earth s surface  This moving around underground is called
subsurface locomotion  Sub surface location has a number of benefits 
One benefit of subsurface locomotion is that it enables animals to minimize their
exposure to extreme temperatures  This is very helpful to animals that live in areas
with harsh climates  where it could be very dangerous to spend large amounts of time
on the surface  For example  in the Sahara Desert  in Africa  there s a type of lizard
that s able to move beneath the surface  through the sand  very quickly  Because this
lizard can move so easily and so quickly underground  it doesn t have to travel on the
surface  where it would be exposed to dangerously high temperatures 
Another benefit of subsurface locomotion is that it can help animals capture prey 
That s because animals on the surface can t see predators approaching underground 
Our lizard in the Sahara Desert is again  a good example  The way it works is  when
an insect is walking nearby on the surface  it produces very subtle vibrations in the
sand  When the lizard senses these vibrations  it moves very quickly  Underground 

153

?



where it can t be seen  is toward the source of the vibrations  It then pops up directly
under the insect and catches it by surprise

So a good example of this is something that happened to me  When I was younger  I
had an office job and I worked there every day during the week  And I made a regular
salary from that  But also I worked as a waiter at a restaurant each weekend  so I
made some money from doing that 
Now  around this time  I decided I wanted to buy a house  So every time I got my
regular paycheck from my job at the office  I d save as much of the money from it as I

154

?



could after I bought the basic stuff I needed  But with the money I made as a waiter
that was another story  Somehow I guess that money seemed separate from the money
I earned at my regular job  So I used the money I made at the restaurant to go out to
dinner  to buy videos or CDs  things I didn t really need 
But the thing is  it ended up taking me a really long time to save up all the money I
needed to buy the house  And looking back now  I realize I could have bought the
house a lot sooner if only I had saved more of the money I made working at the
restaurant

Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class 
Professor
Even though it s cold and snow covered  the Arctic houses many species of animals
that manage to survive the harsh conditions there  These Arctic animals have adapted
to the extremely cold temperatures primarily because of certain body features that
help them to survive in the cold Arctic climate  Let s look at a few of them 
For one thing  many Arctic animals have developed a protective covering on their feet 
The covering usually consists of fur or feathers which act as a protective layer
between the cold and the animals  skin  Since they spend so much of their time on
snowy  icy surfaces  whether they are standing on the ground or swimming in the
water  they can easily lose heat through their feet  This is especially true of Arctic
birds  A bird like the Arctic Snowy Owl  for example  has feathers on its body the way
other birds do  But unlike most birds  it also has feathers all over its feet  This shields
and protects the feet from the icy ground so that very little of the owl s foot actually
touches snowy or icy surfaces  which helps its feet to stay warm 
Another physical characteristic that some Arctic animals share is having smaller
bodies and smaller  shorter body parts  In other words  their bodies are often more
compact than other animals   And the parts of their bodies that stick out or protrude
like the legs  ears or tails are smaller and shorter  And the result is that there is less
body surface exposed to the cold air  A great example is the Arctic wolf  Unlike the
larger grey wolves that live in warmer climates  Arctic wolves have relatively small 
compact bodies that efficiently retain heat  They also have smaller ears and shorter
legs so that they lose less body heat than animals with larger bodies or longer body
parts  And in the climate where the temperature is below zero most of the year  that s
very important

Task3 
Now listen to two students discussing the letter 
 woman 
Did you see this  Jim  What do you think about her idea 
 man 
I think it d be great  It d make things much less expensive  cause our campus is
located outside the city  If you can t get a friend with a car to give you a ride  there is
no other way to get to the airport  And your only choice is to take a taxi 
 woman 
I know  I ve had to take a taxi before and it s pretty expensive 
 man 

156

?



Yeah  like thirty or forty dollars which is a lot especial for students 
 woman 
Yeah  definitely
 man 
And I think it would work what she s suggesting  I mean  there is less need for buses
on campus during that time to take students between the buildings 
 woman 
You mean because classes are over then 
 man 
Yeah  exactly  there might some final exams still going on but regular classes won t
be meeting  There are much fewer students left on campus and they don t need to get
around campus that often 
 woman 
Yeah  I guess they re just making occasional trips to take exams or go to the library or
gym or whatever 
 man 
Right  it shouldn t cause any problems for anyone who still needs to get around
campus 
Task4 
Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a Psychology class 
 male professor 
OK  so an example of this from my own life  five or six years ago  I was helping a
friend of mine decide on a house to buy  He had been in the market to buy a house
and he had it narrowed down to this one house that he was interested in  What he
really liked about this house was it had an excellent location  It was in a great place
that was actually in the same part of town where he was working right up the street
from his job  So he wouldn t have to drive far to get to work which he really liked 
However  the downside of this house was that it was smaller than what he was hoping
to buy  He wanted to buy sort of a big house and this house just wasn t that big  So it
was a tough decision  But my friend eventually did decide to buy the house  And a
few years after he made the purchase  I remember  we were talking about the decision
and why he decided to buy the house  He told me   well  of course  it was because of
the house s location   He told me how happy he was with the fact it was so close to
his work  how great it was only few minutes from his job  I said   Yes  but  what
about its size  Do you still think the house is kind of small   And he looked at me
kind of surprised   Small  What do you mean small   Like he didn t know what I was
talking about  The house s size  a couple of years after buying it  just didn t seem to
be on his mind anymore 
Task5 
Listen to a conversation between two students 
 man 
I don t know about you  but  I m really looking forward to summer break 
 woman 
I can t even think that far ahead  I ve got so much to do before the end of the semester 
I ve been feeling pretty stressed out lately 
 man 
Why  What s going on 
 woman 

157

?



Well  I just have so many assignments  I ve got three major research papers to do and
they all due  basically  at the same time  in two weeks 
 man 
Wow  Three  That is a lot  And research papers take a lot of time 
 woman 
Right  and between my job and classes  there just aren t enough hours in the day to
get them all done 
 man 
Well  is there anything you could cut from your schedule  I mean  you re working
part time in an office in town  aren t you  Why don t you just reduce your hours there
for a while  at least till you get the papers done 
 woman 
Well  I guess I could tell my boss I need to cut back on my hours for a couple of
weeks  uh  but I don t know  I haven t been working there very long  I don t want to
make a bad impression by asking for time off already 
 man 
What else could you do 
 woman 
Well  another option is I could get an extension on one of the papers  I asked one of
my professors about it  my History professor  and she said it would be OK if I handed
the paper in a week late  So  I guess I could just concentrate on getting the other two
papers done first 
 man 
Oh  that s great 
 woman 
Yeah  only she said she d have to take a few points off the grade for the paper since it
would be late  you know  to be fair to the other students 
 man 
Oh  that s a drag  So what are you gonna do 
 woman 
Uh  I don t know yet 
Task6 
Listen to part of a lecture in an Environmental Science class 
 female professor 
Roads  paved roads are everywhere and sometimes seem like part of the natural
landscape  But  of course  roads are not part of nature and  if fact  road construction
can have harmful effects on the environment and seriously impact both animal life
and plant life 
One harmful environmental effect of roads is that they contribute to the movement of
plant species from one area to another  This causes problem for existing plants  plants
already growing in that area because when a new plant species gets into an area where
it wasn t growing before  the new plants compete for resources with existing plant life 
For example  this happened in California with a weed called the yellow starthistle 
What happened was the starthistle s seeds got stuck to the tires of cars driving down
the road and the seeds were distributed to new areas  This put the starthistle in
competition for natural resources  like water  with the original plant life of the area 
That made it harder for the native plants to
survive 
Also roads  especially major highways  can act as barriers and divide up an animal s

158

?



habitat into smaller ones where there is not enough food to support the population 
These busy highways  with cars speeding past day and night  act like boundaries that
animals are afraid to cross  So they sometimes get shut in on a small piece of land
where there isn t enough food to support them  This is a serious problem for animals
that need access to large expanse of land to look for food  For example  there are these
foxes called Kit foxes that live in the southwestern United States  They hunt small
animals like mice and squirrels which are spread out over large areas of open
grasslands  And now  because of these roads  the Kit fox population has declined
significantly because now they don t get enough food 

TPO 33

Task3 
Now listen to two students discussing the letter 
 woman  Hey  did you read that letter  What do you think 
 man  Yeah  I read it  I understand what she s saying but I really don t agree with her
suggestions 
 woman  How come 
 man  Well  students often need to borrow the bikes for longer periods of time 
sometimes a whole day 
 woman  What for 
 man  Well  like  to do stuff off campus  for instance  my friends and I on the
weekends  sometimes we like to ride bikes to the state park outside of town and do
some hiking there  And it basically takes a whole day  It s night time by the time when
we get back 
 woman  So if you had less time you wouldn t be able to do that 
 man  Right  and also her other suggestion doesn t seem practical to me 
 woman  The card thing 
 man  Yeah  that s not gonna work  What if you want to enter a campus building 
Even though you can get into most of the classroom buildings without a card  there
are certain buildings on campus where you need to show your card to get in  like the
library and dining hall 
 woman  Yeah  that s true  so students wouldn t be able to go to any of those places
till they got their cards back 

Task4 
Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class 
 male professor 
OK  so let s talk about what happened to a certain type of insect  a
moth  a red and black moth that lives in Europe  These moths eat a plant called
Ragwort and they live in fields where the Ragwort plants grow  Now  there was a
group of moth that lives in one of these fields and  for many years  there was a lot of
Ragwort growing there  So the moth had plenty to eat and the total number of moth in
the field stayed pretty much the same  But then one year it rained a lot less than usual

159

?



and the Ragwort didn t grow as well 
The result was that the moth didn t get enough to eat and many didn t survive but
even the ones that did survive didn t lay as many eggs as before  So that year the
moth population in the field was quite a bit smaller  The next year  though  the amount
of rainfall returned to normal and again many more Ragwort plants grew and  once
again  there was a lot available for the moth to eat  So that year the moth population
increased and the female moth laid many more eggs than the year before 
And now  after all that rainfall and plant growth  there were just as many moth in the
Ragwort field as there were before 
Task5 
Listen to a conversation between two students 
 man  Tina  I m so glad I bump into you 
 woman  Hey  Bob  what s up 
 man  Well  you know how I told you I could work for you tonight  Cover you shift at
the dining hall later 
 woman  Yeah  thanks so much for that  Friday night dinner shifts are tough to find
substitutes for 
 man  Well  actually 
 woman  Oh  no  Don t tell me something came up and you re canceling 
 man  Um  yeah  I m afraid I forgot tonight I ve got a music rehearsal for the bend
I m in 
 woman  Music rehearsal 
 man  Yeah  I play keyboards for Little Rock Band here on campus and we ve got
practice tonight to prepare for a concert we re doing that s coming up  It s really kind
of important 
 woman  Well  I don t know what to do now because I already made plans to go to the
school s play with some friends tonight 
 man  Oh 
 woman  Yeah  and there s no way I can find someone to work my shift now  It s so
last minute 
 man  I m really sorry  Tina 
 woman  Well  I guess I could cancel my plan to see the play  Go see it another time
by myself since my friends are seeing it tonight  I think it s playing for another week 
 man  Or  you know  I guess I could talk to the band leader explain to him that I can t
make the band practice tonight 
 woman  Yeah 
 man  Yeah  I mean  it s my fault I forgot and I want to do the right thing here since I
did say I d work for you  It s just that some of the songs are new to me and tonight s
our last practice before the concert  I don t want to sound bad at the show 
Task6 
Listen to part of a talk in a business class 
 female professor 
OK  so last time we were talking about the processes of starting up
a business on your own  And how new business owners often encounter a lot of
obstacles  But one way to get an easier start is through franchising  That s when
there s already a well known  established company and you open up a new branch of
that company in a new location  Your new business will be a part of the larger
established company with the same name and it ll be run just like the other branches

160

?



of that company  Let s discuss some advantages of franchising 
Now  one great advantage of franchising is that the company provides training to you
and all of your employees  They teach you about all the aspects of the business and
you re given a plan to follow for success  So  you don t have to do the training
yourself or come up with your own business plan  For example  if you re opening up
a new division of a restaurant that sells pizza  say  Somebody from the company will
come to the restaurant that you re opening and they ll train you and your employees
in how to prepare the pizzas  how to take food orders  plus everything about how to
operate the restaurant so it ll be run exactly like all the other restaurants in the
company 
Another advantage of franchising is the established customer base because your
business will have the same name as the company that s already well known  It ll
already have loyal customers following  So when you open a new division people will
want to come because they ll be confident of its quality  So  again  let s say you re
opening a new restaurant  a pizza place  The restaurant is already well known
because it has such good pizza  So when you open your own restaurant with the same
name in a new location  people know your pizza s going to be really good  too 
They ll go to your restaurant because they already trust they ll have a good
experience there

Program to Provide Free Tutoring 
 

 

The university has announced that starting with the fall semester  free tutoring will be 
available to all new students for their entire first year  The academic dean  James Maxwell  
commented   The university is aware of the academic problems that many first year 
students face when making the transition from high school to college   The new tutoring 
program  he said  is designed to assist first year students who want or need additional 
support with their academic course work  The program will also be organized so that 
individual students can arrange to work with tutors majoring in their own chosen field of 
study  
 

 

Now listen to two students discussing the article  
 

 

 man  Hey  did you read about this plan   woman  
Yeah  and I think it s really a great idea   man  
Why s that  
 woman  Well  a lot of new students really need this  I mean  it s not just about getting extra 
help with the course material  they ll probably also get information about things like taking 
162 


 
 

 

 
 

notes or the best way to study for exams  
 man  Yeah  I barely even knew how to do those things when I first came here  

163

163 


 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 woman  Neither did I  So these are things most students wind up having to learn on their 
own at first  That s why so many of them have a hard time  
 man  And it s probably good that they can work with somebody who has the same 
interests  
 woman  Right  that will be a real advantage  to get information about the classes you re 
gonna need to take from somebody who s already taken those classes  And they could 
recommend professors and tell you who the best advisers in the department are  things like 
that  
 man  I see what you mean  so new students could get access to information about the 
program from another student s point of view

seconds to read the passage  Begin reading now  
 

 

The Familiarity Principle 
 

 

People tend to develop a preference for this they have previously encountered  things they 
are familiar with  Social psychologists refer to this tendency as the familiarity principle  
Given a choice between two similar items  one they have experienced before and another 
that is new  most people will choose the familiar item  This principle operates even when 
people are not conscious of their previous experience with an item  Once people have been 
exposed to an item – even if they do not recall having been exposed to it – they will tend to 
prefer that item over other items to which they have not been previously exposed  
 

 

Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a Psychology class  
 

 

 male professor  Some researchers did an experiment related to this  What they did was 
they assembled a group of subjects  a group of students  and they showed these students a 
series of geometrical shapes  These were very distinctive shapes  a little unusual  not the 
kind of shapes students often see  But they only showed the students the shapes for a very 
short period of time  about a second  They also lowered the light in the room to make it 
164 


 
 

 

 
 

 

 
even more difficult for the students to see the shapes  So the shapes were there for a split 
second in dim light and then they were gone  
 

 

In the next step of the experiment  the researchers again showed the students some shapes  
but this time they gave the students a longer time to look at them  And this time they 
showed the images in pairs  two at a time  In each pair  one shape was a shape the students 
had already seen for just a split second in dim light  And the other was some other shape 
that hadn t been shown to them before  After presenting each pair  the researchers asked 
the students to say which of the two shapes they liked better  

165

 

 

Most of the time  the students preferred the shape they d already seen earlier in the 
experiment  Now  if you asked them if they d already seen that shape  they probably 
wouldn t know for sure  But that didn t matter  They still tended to prefer the shapes they d 
already seen  
 

 

Explain how the experiment described by the professor illustrates the familiarity principle

 woman  Hey  Mike  how s it going  
 man  OK 
 woman  Something s the matter  
 man  Well  sort of  I m taking this French class 
 woman  OK  
 man  And one of the class requirements is a weekend trip to Canada to Montreal which is in 
the French speaking part of Canada  It s only like five hours from here  So the next weekend 
the whole class s going on a bus  We re supposed to practice French  you know  talk to 
people and we re going to a play  
 woman  Sounds like fun  
 man  Yeah  I d love to go  
 woman  But  
 man  Well  we ll be crossing an international boarder so in order to go you need a passport  
The professor told us a while ago to be sure to get a passport but I completely forgot to 
apply for one  
 woman  What are you gonna do  
 man  Well  I talked to my professor and she said I could fulfill the requirement a different 
165 


 
 

 

 
 

 

 
way if I want  Instead of going on the trip  I could stay here and write a short paper about 
Montreal  
 woman  In French  
 man  Yeah  I d have to do a little research and write about three pages  Talk about Montreal  
its history or whatever  in French  It wouldn t be too hard  
 woman  But then you d miss out on a great trip to Montreal  
 man  I know  
 woman  Well  you know there s another option  You can probably still get a passport in time 
if you go directly to US Passport Office and pay extra  Then you could go  
 man  Yeah  actually  I looked into that  I can still get a passport in time  but to get it at the 
last minute is expensive  like  150 dollars  And I don t know if I want to spend that much  
 woman  That is a lot of money

Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class  
 

 

 female professor  So  OK  we ve been talking about frogs  and like all amphibians  frog has 
thin skin  which means they lose moisture through their skin easily  Now  typically  we think 
of frogs as living in wet environments  But for frogs who live in dry places  with desert like 
conditions  this can be a problem  Frogs have been able to survive in such areas by having 
different physical features  special dry climate features that help them maintain an adequate 
level of moisture in their cells and avoid drying out  
 

 

Some frogs do this by preventing water loss through their skin  By creating a sort of covering 
over their skin  they greatly reduce their skin s exposure to the dry air  The covering acts like 
a barrier that locks in moisture  For example  some frogs secrete a substance through their 
skin  a fatty substance that they rub off over their skin using their hands and feet  which 
creates a waxy layer all around their bodies that s almost completely water tight  
 

 

Other frogs maintain an adequate level of moisture through a different physical feature  one 
that allows them to store water inside their bodies for later use  A specially modified internal 
organ inside their bodies enables them to have a high water storage capacity  So the frogs 
are able to absorb and store moisture during wet rainy times which they can rely on to get 
166 


 
 

 

 
 

 

 
through dry periods  The aptly named water holding frog  for example  has a bladder that is 
highly elastic and stretchable  When it does rain  the frog absorbs water through its skin and 
its bladder stretches to hold this extra water  The water is then slowly released from the 
special bladder into the frog s internal tissues until the next rain which might not be for 
several months  
 

 

Using points and examples from the lecture  explain two dry climate features of frogs
