TPO 9 Lecture 4 Linguistic

Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class  The professor has been discussing Animal communication systems

L  OK  so last time  we covered the dances honey bees do to indicate where food can be found and the calls and songs of different types of birds  Today  I d like to look at some communication systems found in mammals  particularly in primates  such as orangutans  chimpanzees  gorillas    Yes  Thomas

T  Excuse me  Professor  But when you talk about gorilla language  do you mean like  those experiments where humans taught them sign language or a language like

L  OK  wait just a minute  Now  who in this class heard me use the word  language   No one I hope  What we re talking about here  are systems of communication  all right

T  Oh  sorry  communication  right  But could you maybe  like  clarify what the difference is

L  Of course  that s a fair question  OK  well  to start with  let s make it clear that language is a type of communication  not the other way around  OK  so all communication systems  language included  have certain features in common
For example  the signals used to communicate from the bee s dance movements  to the word and sentences found in human languages  All these signals convey meaning  And all communication systems serve a purpose  a pragmatic function of some sort  Warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information

But there re several features peculiar to human language that have  for the most part  never been found in the communication system of any other species

For one thing  learn ability  Animals have instinctive communication systems  When a dog  a puppy gets to certain age  it s able to bark  It barks without having to learn how from other dogs  it just barks  But much of human language has to be learned from other humans

What else makes human language unique  What makes it different from animal communication  Deborah

D  How about grammar  Like having verbs  nouns  adjectives

L  OK  that s another feature  And it s a good example

D  I mean I mention this  cause like in my biology class last year  I kind of remember talking about a study on prairie dogs  where  I think the researchers claimed that the warning cries of prairie dogs constitute language  because they have these different parts of speech  You know  like nouns  to name the type of predator they spotted  adjectives to describe its size and shape  verbs     but now it seems like

L  All right  hold on a moment  I m familiar with the study you re talking about  And for those of you who don t know  prairie dogs are not actually dogs  They re a type of rodent who  who burrow in the ground in the grasslands of the western United States and Mexico

In this study  the researchers looked at the high pitched barks a prairie dog makes when it spots predator  And from this they made some pretty    well  they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language  with its own primitive grammar  But actually  these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys  And  well  let s not even get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal communication

Another thing that distinguishes a real language is a property we call  discreteness   In other words  messages are built up out of smaller parts  sentences out of words  words out of individual sounds  etc  Now maybe you could say that the prairie dog s message is built from smaller parts  like say for example  our prairie dog spots a predator  a big coyote approaching rapidly  So the prairie dog makes a call that means  coyote   then one that means  large   and then another one to indicate its speed  But do you really suppose it makes any difference what order these calls come in  No

But the discrete units that make up language can be put together in different ways  Those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages  including messages that are completely novel  that have never been expressed before  For example  we can differentiate between   A large coyote moves fast   and say  Move the large coyote fast   or  Move fast  large coyote    and I truly doubt whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before

Human language is productive  an open ended communication system  whereas no other communication system has this property

And another feature of language that s not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call  displacement   That is  language is abstract enough that we can talk about things that aren t present here and now  Things like  My friend Joe is not in the room   or  It will probably rain next Thursday   Prairie dogs may be able to tell you about a hawk that s circling overhead right now  but they never show any inclination to describe the one they saw last week
