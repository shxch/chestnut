Petroleum  consisting of crude oil and natural gas  seems to originate from organic matter in marine sediment  Microscopic organisms settle to the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud  The organic matter may partially decompose  using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment  As soon as the oxygen is gone  decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved

Continued sedimentation the process of deposits  settling on the sea bottom buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures  which convert the organic matter to oil and gas  As muddy sediments are pressed together  the gas and small droplets of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy layers nearby  Over long periods of time  millions of years   accumulations of gas and oil can collect in the sandy layers  Both oil and gas are less dense than water  so they generally tend to rise upward through water saturated rock and sediment

Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations of oil  and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools  When an oil pool or field has been discovered  wells are drilled into the ground  Permanent towers  called derricks  used to be built to handle the long sections of drilling pipe  Now portable drilling machines are set up and are then dismantled and removed  When the well reaches a pool  oil usually rises up the well because of its density difference with water beneath it or because of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it  Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today  spouts of oil  or gushers  were common in the past  Gas pressure gradually dies out  and oil is pumped from the well  Water or steam may be pumped down adjacent wells to help push the oil out  At a refinery  the crude oil from underground is separated into natural gas  gasoline  kerosene  and various oils  Petrochemicals such as dyes  fertilizer  and plastic are also manufactured from the petroleum

As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find  the search for it is extended into more hostile environments  The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries  Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean s continental shelves those gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents  More than one quarter of the world s oil and almost one fifth of the world s natural gas come from offshore  even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land  A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway

Of course  there is far more oil underground than can be recovered  It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling  Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden  such as national parks or other public lands  Even given the best extraction techniques  only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface  The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground

Moreover  getting petroleum out of the ground and from under the sea and to the consumer can create environmental problems anywhere along the line  Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or landslides  causing serious oil spills  Spillage from huge oil carrying cargo ships  called tankers  involved in collisions or accidental groundings  such as the one off Alaska in 1989  can create oil slicks at sea  Offshore platforms may also lose oil  creating oil slicks that drift ashore and foul the beaches  harming the environment  Sometimes  the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is removed  The Wilmington field near Long Beach  California  has subsided nine meters in 50 years  protective barriers have had to be built to prevent seawater from flooding the area  Finally  the refining and burning of petroleum and its products can cause air pollution  Advancing technology and strict laws  however  are helping control some of these adverse environmental effects

13 Look at the four squares  █  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Unless something acts to halt this migration  these natural resources will eventually reach the surface

Where would the sentence best fit

14． Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

 Petroleum  is a broad term that includes both crude oil and natural gas







Answer choices

 Petroleum formation is the result of biological as well as chemical activity
 The difficulty of finding adequate sources of oil on land has resulted in a greater number of offshore drilling sites
 Petroleum extraction can have a negative impact on the environment
 Petroleum tends to rise to the surface  since it is lower in density than water
 Current methods of petroleum extraction enable oil producers to recover about half of the world s petroleum reserves
 Accidents involving oil tankers occur when tankers run into shore reefs or collide with other vessels
