Early Settlements in the Southwest Asia
The universal global warming at the end of the Ice Age had dramatic effects on temperate regions of Asia  Europe  and North America  Ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose  The climatic changes in southwestern Asia were more subtle  in that they involved shifts in mountain snow lines  rainfall patterns  and vegetation cover  However  these same cycles of change had momentous impacts on the sparse human populations of the region  At the end of the Ice Age  no more than a few thousand foragers lived along the eastern Mediterranean coast  in the Jordan and Euphrates valleys  Within 2 000 years  the human population of the region numbered in the tens of thousands  all as a result of village life and farming  Thanks to new environmental and archaeological discoveries  we now know something about this remarkable change in local life

Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and elsewhere tell us forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age  for the southwestern Asian climate was still cooler and considerably wetter than today  Many areas were richer in animal and plant species than they are now  making them highly favorable for human occupation  About 9000 B C   most human settlements lay in the area along the Mediterranean coast and in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and their foothills  Some local areas  like the Jordan River valley  the middle Euphrates valley  and some Zagros valleys  were more densely populated than elsewhere  Here more sedentary and more complex societies flourished  These people exploited the landscape intensively  foraging on hill slopes for wild cereal grasses and nuts  while hunting gazelle and other game on grassy lowlands and in river valleys  Their settlements contain exotic objects such as seashells  stone bowls  and artifacts made of obsidian  volcanic glass   all traded from afar  This considerable volume of intercommunity exchange brought a degree of social complexity in its wake

Thanks to extremely fine grained excavation and extensive use of flotation methods  through which seeds are recovered from soil samples   we know a great deal about the foraging practices of the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria s Euphrates valley  Abu Hureyra was founded about 9500B C  a small village settlement of cramped pit dwellings  houses dug partially in the soil  with reed roofs supported by wooden uprights  For the next 1 500 years  its inhabitants enjoyed a somewhat warmer and damper climate than today  living in a well wooded steppe area where wild cereal grasses were abundant  They subsisted off spring migrations of Persian gazelles from the south  With such a favorable location  about 300 to 400 people lived in a sizable  permanent settlement  They were no longer a series of small bands but lived in a large community with more elaborate social organization  probably grouped into clans of people of common descent

The flotation samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study shifts in plant collecting habits as if they were looking through a telescope at a changing landscape  Hundreds of tiny plant remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and oak forests  However  as the climate dried up  the forests retreated from the vicinity of the settlement  The inhabitants turned to wild cereal grasses instead  collecting them by the thousands  while the percentage of nuts in the diet fell  By 8200B C   drought conditions were so severe that the people abandoned their long established settlement  perhaps dispersing into smaller camps

Five centuries later  about 7700B C   a new village rose on the mound  At first the inhabitants still hunted gazelle intensively  Then  about 7000 B C   within the space of a few generations  they switched abruptly to herding   domesticated goats and sheep and to growing einkorn  pulses  and other cereal grasses  Abu Hureyra grew rapidly until it covered nearly 30 acres  It was a close knit community of rectangular  one story mud brick houses  joined by narrow lanes and courtyards  finally abandoned about 5000 B C   Many complex factors led to the adoption of the new economies  not only at Abu Hureyra  but at many other locations such as  Ain Ghazal  also in Syria  where goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of abrasion caused by foot tethering  binding  testify to early herding of domestic stock

12  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 In many areas besides Abu Hureyra  complex factors led to new economies including the herding of domestic stock
 In Ain Ghazal and Syria  domestic stock was more important than it was at Abu Hureyra
 Once early methods of herding animals improved  new economies were adopted
 Many complex theories attempt to explain the early domestication of animals
