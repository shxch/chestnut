Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor

Professor Excuse me  can I help you  You look a little lost

Student Yeah  I am  This is my first day on campus  and I don t know where anything is

Professor Can t find your orientation session

Student Uh huh  What a way to begin  Lost going to orientation

Professor Well  my guess is in the auditorium  that s where they usually are

Student You re right  the general ones  I went to one of those sessions ealier today  But now I need the one for my major  engineering  My schedule says the meeting room is in     Johnson Hall  In the engineering department  which should be right here in front of us  according to the map  But this building is called the Morgan Hall

Professor Well  your map reading skills are fine actually  This used to be Johnson Hall  all right  Trouble is they changed the name to Morgan Hall last spring  So they sent you a map with an old name  I am surprised

Student Well  this was actually mailed out month and month ago  I got a second pack in the mail more recently with another one of these maps in it  I guess they must have the updated name  I left that one in my dorm room

Professor Well  things change fast around here  This building was renamed after one of our professors  She retired a few months ago  She is very well known in the world of physics  Too bad for Johnson  I guess

Student Who is Johnson anyway

Professor Oh  one of the early professors here  Unfortunately  I thinks his ideas are going out of style  Science kept marching forward

Student I ll say it does  That s why I transferred to this university  I was really impressed with all the research equipment you guys have at the laboratories  You are really on the forefront

Professor Um    so do you know what kind of engineering you want to specialize in

Student Yeah  aerospace engineering

Professor Well  the aerospace engineering department here is excellent  Eh    do you know that this university was the first one in the country to offer a program in aerospace engineering

Student Yeah  I know  And a couple of students who graduated from here became astronauts and orbited the Earth

Professor Right  The department has many prominent alumni  Well  you might end up taking some of your advanced math course with me  I get a lot of students from the engineering department because I teach the required applied mathematics courses

Student Oh  cool  Actually  I want to get a minor in math

Professor Excellent  Hmm    A major in aerospace engineering with a minor in math  you ll go far with that degree  More of our students should do that  There are so many more opportunities available in the field when you have a strong math background

Student I m glad to hear you say that
