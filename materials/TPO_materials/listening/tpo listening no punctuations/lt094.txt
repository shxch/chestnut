Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian employee

S  Excuse me  Can you help me with something

L  I ll do my best  What do you need

S  Well  I received a letter in my mailbox saying that I m supposed to return a book that I checked out back in January  it s call  Modern Social Problems   But because I m writing my senior thesis  I m supposed to be able to keep the book all semester

L  So you signed up for extended borrowing privileges

S  Yeah

L  But we are still asking you to bring the book back

S  Uh huh

L  Well  let me take a look and see what the computer says  The title was
 Modern Social Problems

S  Yeah

L  OK  Um    Oh  I see  it s been recalled  You can keep it all semester as long as no one else requests it  But  someone else has  It looks like one of the professors in the sociology department has requested it  So you have to bring it back  even though you ve got extended borrowing privileges  You can check out the book again when it s returned in a couple of weeks

S  But I really need this book right now

L  Do you need all of it or is there a certain section or chapter you re working with

S  I guess there is one particular chapter I ve been using lately for a section of my thesis  Why

L  Well  you can photocopy up to one chapter of the book  Why don t you do that for the chapter you re working on right now  And by the time you need the rest of the book  maybe it will have been returned  We can even do the photocopying for you because of the circumstances

S  Oh  well  that would be great

L  I see you ve got some books there  Is that the one you were asked to return

S  No  I left it in my dorm room  These are books I need to check out today  Is it Ok if I bring that one by in a couple of days

L  Actually  you need to return it today  That is if you want to check out those books today  That s our policy

S  Oh  I didn t know that

L  Yeah  not a lot of people realize that  In fact  every semester we get a few students who have their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven t returned books  They re allowed to use books only in the library  They re not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books

S  That s not good  I guess I should head back down to the dorm right now then

L  But  before you go  what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks  You don t want to waste any time getting it back

S  Thanks a lot  Now I don t feel quite so bad about having to return the book
