纸质版TPO4 conversation 2

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor
Student
Hi  uh… Professor Anderson… wondering if you had a couple minutes
Professor
Of course  Paula…
Student
Thanks       uh  you sent me a letter recently about doing  uh  an honors project inviting me to come in and talk about
Professor
Right  right  well  as your academic advisor  it s my job to look out for your academic interests  and based on your grades  and some very positive feedback I ve heard from your professors  I wanted to formally invite you to consider doing an honors project
Student
Yeah       well  thanks       uh  actually I kinda wanted to ask you       quite frankly like how much work it would probably be  I mean  I m gonna be spending a lot of time applying to law schools next semester and
Professor
Well  let me tell you how it works       and then you can decide from there
Student
OK
Professor
Basically  the honors project is an opportunity to do       some in depth work on a topic you re interested in before graduating college  You register for the class  but it doesn t work the same way a regular class does you find a professor who you want to work with you ask the professor a sort of mentor who s knowledgeable on the topic you re interested in the topic you re gonna write your honors thesis on
Student
Writing a thesis  That s part of the project  Ah  like how many pages are we talking
Professor
Usually about 50       but it s a valuable experience  writing a thesis paper
Student
So  basically  after I register for the class  I need to ask a professor who ll sorta help me…
Professor
Actually  you need to do that a professor needs to agree to oversee your honors project before you register
Student
Oh  OK…
Professor
I mean  I know it sounds kinda daunting  but that s what the professor s there for to help guide you through the different steps of the process and       uh       most students are very pleased with the experience       they re able to demonstrate advanced research skills  which is important  especially in your case  writing an honors thesis would be a big plus
Student
You think so
Professor
Absolutely  Especially considering your plans  since you re applying to law schools  It shows initiative  that you ve done well as an undergraduate to be allowed to do the honors project       that you re able to work independently and  of course  you would graduate with honors
Student
Yeah  it does sound good it s just  you know  l ve never written something like that before  so
Professor
Well  you choose something you re interested in maybe you can even expand a shorter research paper from another class or
Student
So  like  maybe       You know  I took this course from Professor Connelly his course on Comparative Governments last semester and  uh       did pretty well l wrote a paper actually  on political parties in Venezuela and and he seemed to like my research  Anyway  he  uh  I got an A in the course
Professor
Good  so it sounds like you do have a general idea for a topic  and you might know what professor you want to work with       and look  it s still a couple weeks before registration  maybe you should talk to Professor Connelly and then get back to me
Student
Yeah  I will thanks  I II come by again sometime next week
Professor
That s fine  Good luck
