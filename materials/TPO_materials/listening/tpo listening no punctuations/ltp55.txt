纸质版TPO5 Lecture3 astronomy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class

Professor
I II tell you a story about how one astronomy problem was solved  It happened many years ago  but you ll see that it s interesting and still relevant  Two  three hundred years ago  astronomers already had telescopes  but they were not as powerful as those we have now  Let s say       they were at the level of telescopes amateur astronomers use today  Tell me  what do you see in the night sky when you use a telescope like that  Quick  tell me
Female student
Planets
Professor
Right
Male student
Even       like       the moons of Jupiter
Professor
Right
Female student
Stars
Professor
OK       what else        You think that s all        Ever heard of nebulae        I bet you have       Well  let s just  um  put it up anyway

Nebulae are small fuzzy patches you see in the sky  they look like little clouds  Many of them have a spiral shape  and that s why we called them spiral nebulae       So astronomers in the eighteenth century       eighteenth century       when they looked through the telescope  they could see planets and they knew those were planets      the moons of Jupiter and they knew they were the moons of Jupiter       and then they saw spiral nebulae and they didn t have a clue
What could those be  So  some of them thought  these things are cloudy and fuzzy  so they re probably small clouds of cosmic dust  and they don t have to be very far away from us   But there were others who thought   OK  the things look small and fuzzy  but maybe they re actually distant galaxies of stars  but we can t see the stars  because they re so far away and they seem so tiny that they look like dust  and even the whole galaxy looks like a tiny little cloud

Which of the two theories do you think was more       uh  surprising
Male student
The galaxy one
Professor
And why
Male student
Well  I mean it assumed that the nebulae are not what they look like at first sight  The first theory assumed that  right
Professor
OK  And now tell me this       which one would have seemed more likely at the time
Male student
Uh       They couldn t tell
Professor
Right  Two morals here  first  there can be different explanations for the same observation  And second   obvious  doesn t necessarily mean  right        What happened next was       for a long time nothing  More than 150 years  No one could decide       Both hypotheses seemed plausible       And a lot was at stake because if the galaxy theory was right  it would be proof that the universe is enormous       and if the dust theory was right       maybe not so enormous  So the size of the universe was at stake       Finally in the 1920s we came up with a telescope that was strong enough to tell us something new here  When we used it to look at the spiral nebulae  we saw       well  we were not absolutely sure       but it really looked like there were stars in those nebulae  So not dust after all  but stars

But how far away were they  really  How would you measure that  Any ideas  Laura
Female student
Well  how about measuring how strong those stars shine  Because  if the star is far away  then its light would be weak  right
Professor
Yes       but there s a problem here  You need to know how bright the star is in the first place  because some stars are naturally much brighter than others  So  if you see a star that s weak       it can mean one of two things
Female student
Oh       it s either far away or it s just a weak star
Professor
And you can t really always tell which  But you re on the right track  There is a kind of star where you can calculate its natural brightness       and you guessed it we found some in the nebulae  It s called a variable star or a  variable  for short because its brightness varies in regular intervals  I won t go into detail here  but       basically       the longer the interval  the brighter the star  so from the length of those intervals we were able to calculate their natural brightness  This told us how distant they were and many turned out to be very  very far away  So we can be sure that the spiral nebulae really are very distant galaxies which is what some eighteenth century astronomers guessed but didn t have the instruments to prove
Now  one reason I told you this story is that today there are still plenty of situations when we see something out there  but we really aren t sure what it is  An example of one such mysterious observation would be gamma ray bursters

We ve known about these gamma ray bursters for a long time now  but we can t all agree on what they are

Narrator
Listen again to part of the lecture  Then answer the question
Professor
But how far away were they  really  How would you measure that  Any ideas  Laura
Female student
Well  how about measuring how strong those stars shine  Because  if the star is far away  then its light would be weak  right
Professor
Yes       but there s a problem here  You need to know how bright the star is in the first place  because some stars are naturally much brighter than others  So  if you see a star that s weak       it can mean one of two things
Female student
Oh       it s either far away or it s just a weak star
Narrator
What can be inferred about the student when she says this
Female student
Oh       it s either far away or it s just a weak star
