What is a community
The Black Hills forest  the prairie riparian forest  and other forests of the western United States can be separated by the distinctly different combinations of species they comprise  It is easy to distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest one is a broad leaved forest of ash and cottonwood trees  the other is a coniferous forest of ponderosa pine and white spruce trees  One has kingbirds  the other juncos  birds with white outer tail feathers   The fact that ecological communities are indeed  recognizable clusters of species led some early ecologists  particularly those living in the beginning of the twentieth century  to claim that communities are highly integrated  precisely balanced assemblages  This claim harkens back to even earlier arguments about the existence of a balance of nature  where every species is there for a specific purpose  like a vital part in a complex machine  Such a belief would suggest that to remove any species  whether it be plant  bird  or insect  would somehow disrupt the balance  and the habitat would begin to deteriorate  Likewise  to add a species may be equally disruptive

One of these pioneer ecologists was Frederick Clements  who studied ecology extensively throughout the Midwest and other areas in North America  He held that within any given region of climate  ecological communities tended to slowly converge toward a single endpoint  which he called the  climatic climax   This  climax  community was  in Clements s mind  the most well balanced  integrated grouping of species that could occur within that particular region  Clements even thought that the process of ecological succession the replacement of some species by others over time was somewhat akin to the development of an organism  from embryo to adult  Clements thought that succession represented discrete stages in the development of the community  rather like infancy  childhood  and adolescence   terminating in the climatic  adult  stage  when the community became self reproducing and succession ceased  Clements s view of the ecological community reflected the notion of a precise balance of nature

Clements was challenged by another pioneer ecologist  Henry Gleason  who took the opposite view  Gleason viewed the community as largely a group of species with similar tolerances to the stresses imposed by climate and other factors typical of the region  Gleason saw the element of chance as important in influencing where species occurred  His concept of the community suggests that nature is not highly integrated  Gleason thought succession could take numerous directions  depending upon local circumstances

Who was right  Many ecologists have made precise measurements  designed to test the assumptions of both the Clements and Gleason models  For instance  along mountain slopes  does one life zone  or habitat type  grade sharply or gradually into another  If the divisions are sharp  perhaps the reason is that the community is so well integrated  so holistic  so like Clements viewed it  that whole clusters of species must remain together  If the divisions are gradual  perhaps  as Gleason suggested  each species is responding individually to its environment  and clusters of species are not so integrated that they must always occur together

It now appears that Gleason was far closer to the truth than Clements  The ecological community is largely an accidental assemblage of species with similar responses to a particular climate  Green ash trees are found in association with plains cottonwood trees because both can survive well on floodplains and the competition between them is not so strong that only one can persevere  One ecological community often flows into another so gradually that it is next to impossible to say where one leaves off and the other begins  Communities are individualistic
This is not to say that precise harmonies are not present within communities  Most flowering plants could not exist were it not for their pollinators and vice versa  Predators  disease organisms  and competitors all influence the abundance and distribution of everything from oak trees to field mice  But if we see a precise balance of nature  it is largely an artifact of our perception  due to the illusion that nature  especially a complex system like a forest  seems so unchanging from one day to the next


1  In paragraph 1  why does the author distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest
  To highlight the difference between the views of various ecologists about the nature of ecological communities
  To illustrate why some ecologists tended to view ecological communities as highly integrated
  To demonstrate that one forest has a greater variety of species than the other
  To show how these two forests differ from others in the United States

2  According to paragraph 1  what was a common claim about ecological communities before the early twentieth century
  Every species in a community has a specific role in that community
  It is important to protect communities by removing certain species
  A precise balance is difficult to maintain in an ecological community
  It is necessary for new species to be added quickly as ecological communities develop

3  The word  clusters  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  models
  categories
  examples
  groups

4  According to paragraph 1  the belief in a balance of nature suggests that removing a species from an ecological community would have which of the following effects
  It would reduce competition between the remaining species of the community
  It would produce a different  but equally balanced  community
  It would lead to a decline in the community
  It would cause more harm than adding a species to the community






5  The word  ceased  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  succeeded
  balanced
  ended
  advanced

6  Which of the following best represents the view of ecological communities associated with Frederick Clements in paragraph 2
  Only when all species in a community are at the reproductive stage of development is an ecological community precisely balanced
  When an ecological community achieves  climatic climax   it begins to decline
  All climates have similar climax communities
  Ecological communities eventually reach the maximum level of balance that is possible for their region

7  According to paragraph 2  Clements compared the process of ecological succession to
  the replacement of animal habitats over time
  the development of an organism
  self reproduction
  changes in climate


8  According to Gleason in paragraph 3  the occurrence of a species in a particular community is influenced by
  unpredictable events
  how individualistic the species is
  the number of other species present
  the tolerance of other species to stresses




9  What did the ecologists in paragraph 4 hope to determine with their measurements
  Whether different species compete for the same environments
  Whether habitats are sharply separated or gradually flow into each other
  Whether succession differs in different types of habitats
  Whether integrated communities survive better than independent communities


10  In paragraph 5  why does the author mention green ash trees and plains cottonwood trees
  To support the current view about how ecological communities develop
  To provide an example of species that prefer to live on floodplains
  To provide evidence that supports the theory of Clements
  To show where one ecological community stops and the other begins

11  The word  persevere  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  reproduce
  fail
  expand
  continue


12  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in paragraph 6  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  We see nature as precisely balanced because nature is unchanging
  A precise balance of nature is not possible because of the complexity of natural systems
  0ur sense that nature is precisely balanced results from the illusion that it is unchanging
  Because nature is precisely balanced  complex systems do not seem to change



13 Look at the four squares   that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage  Where would the sentence best fit
Their research has helped to decide between the two views because it has focused on questions to which Clements and Gleason would give opposing answers


14  Directions  An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  Over time  a variety of views have been formed on the structure of ecological communities

Answer Choices
  Clements held that ecological communities were like organisms that compete with each other for dominance in a particular climatic region
  Clements saw the community as a collection of thoroughly interdependent species progressing toward a single climax community
  Gleason held that within a single climatic region  differing local factors would cause ecological communities to develop in different ways
  Gleason believed that sharp divisions would exist between species in different habitats
  Today s ecologists recognize that ecological communities must be precisely and permanently balanced
  The current thinking is that communities are individualistic and largely accidental collections of species with similar needs and tolerances
