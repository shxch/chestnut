Bronze Age Tools and Weapons 

For most of human history, people made tools and weapons from stone. This period of time was the stone Age. Gradually, humans learned how to make metal tools and weapons. One of the first metals people worked with was bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. When people started using it, their civilization entered the Bronze Age. 

Cultures began the Bronze Age at different times. The oldest bronze tools discovered date to 3800 B.C. They were found in Iran. Many societies entered the Bronze Age around 3000 B.C. It generally lasted until around 1200 to 1000 B.C. During this era, bronze arrowheads, swords, spear points, and armor were common. Bronze tools included axes and knives. 

Bronze had many advantages over stone and metals such as copper. It was stronger and lasted longer. It was easier to shape than stone. And bronze objects sharpened more easily than copper.
