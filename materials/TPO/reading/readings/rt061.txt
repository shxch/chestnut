Powering the Industrial Revolution
In Britain one of the most dramatic changes of the Industrial Revolution was the harnessing of power  Until the reign of George Ⅲ 1760 1820   available sources of power for work and travel had not increased since the Middle Ages  There were three sources of power  animal or human muscles  the wind  operating on sail or windmill  and running water  Only the last of these was suited at all to the continuous operating of machines  and although waterpower abounded in Lancashire and Scotland and ran grain mills as well as textile mills  it had one great disadvantage  streams flowed where nature intended them to  and water driven factories had to be located on their banks whether or not the location was desirable for other reasons  Furthermore  even the most reliable waterpower varied with the seasons and disappeared in a drought  The new age of machinery  in short  could not have been born without a new source of both movable and constant power

The source had long been known but not exploited  Early in the eighteenth century  a pump had come into use in which expanding steam raised a piston in a cylinder  and atmospheric pressure brought it down again when the steam condensed inside the cylinder to form a vacuum  This  atmospheric engine   invented by Thomas Savery and vastly improved by his partner  Thomas Newcomen  embodied revolutionary principles  but it was so slow and wasteful of fuel that it could not be employed outside the coal mines for which it had been designed  In the 1760s  James Watt perfected a separate condenser for the steam  so that the cylinder did not have to be cooled at every stroke  then he devised a way to make the piston turn a wheel and thus convert reciprocating  back and forth  motion into rotary motion  He thereby transformed an inefficient pump of limited use into a steam engine of a thousand uses  The final step came when steam was introduced into the cylinder to drive the piston backward as well as forward  thereby increasing the speed of the engine and cutting its fuel consumption

Watt s steam engine soon showed what it could do  It liberated industry from dependence on running water  The engine eliminated water in the mines by driving efficient pumps  which made possible deeper and deeper mining  The ready availability of coal inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to develop the first new form of nighttime illumination to be discovered in a millennium and a half  Coal gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles  and early in the new century  well to do Londoners grew accustomed to gaslit houses and even streets  Iron manufacturers  which had starved for fuel while depending on charcoal  also benefited from ever increasing supplies of coal  blast furnaces with steam powered bellows turned out more iron and steel for the new machinery  Steam became the motive force of the Industrial Revolution as coal and iron ore were the raw materials

By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines were in use in the British Isles  and Britain retained a virtual monopoly on steam engine production until the 1830s  Steam power did not merely spin cotton and roll iron  early in the new century  it also multiplied ten times over the amount of paper that a single worker could produce in a day  At the same time  operators of the first printing presses run by steam rather than by hand found it possible to produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than thirty  Steam also promised to eliminate a transportation problem not fully solved by either canal boats or turnpikes  Boats could carry heavy weights  but canals could not cross hilly terrain  turnpikes could cross the hills  but the roadbeds could not stand up under   great weights  These problems needed still another solution  and the ingredients for it lay close at hand  In some industrial regions  heavily laden wagons  with flanged wheels  were being hauled by horses along metal rails  and the stationary steam engine was puffing in the factory and mine  Another generation passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients  by putting the engine on wheels and the wheels on the rails  so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse  Thus the railroad age sprang from what had already happened in the eighteenth century


1  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information．
 Running water was the best power source for factories since it could keep machines operating continuously  but since it was abundant only in Lancashire and Scotland  most mills and factories that were located elsewhere could not be water driven
  The disadvantage of using waterpower is that streams do not necessarily flow in places that are the most suitable for factories  which explains why so many water powered grain and textile mills were located in undesirable places
  Since machines could be operated continuously only where running water was abundant  grain and textile mills  as well as other factories  tended to be located only in Lancashire and Scotland
  Running water was the only source of power that was suitable for the continuous operation of machines  but to make use of it  factories had to be located where the water was  regardless of whether such locations made sense otherwise
