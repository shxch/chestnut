Lecture1 Music  Ancient Greek Music & Plato
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music class

Professor
Today we are going to do something a little different  In the past few classes  we ve listened to traditional music from around the world and we ve talked about the characteristics of these music  what makes these styles distinctive  what kinds of instruments are used  And you ve talked about what sounds familiar to you and what sounds strange  And many of you found some of what we ve listened to very strange indeed
Well  today I want to start talking about western music and I am going to start in ancient Greece  But  now here s the part that s different  We re not going to talk very much about the actual music  Instead  we are going to talk about what the Greeks believed about music
Now  there are some very good reasons to approach the material in this way  First  well  we don t have very much ancient Greek music studied  Only about 45 pieces survived…uh…these are mostly records of poems and songs  And we are not sure how well we can reproduce the melodies or rhythms  because they were apparently improvised in many cases  So we really don t know all that much about what the music sounded like
What we do know about   and this really is the most important reason I am approaching today s lecture the way I am   is the Greek philosophy about music and its continuing influence on western attitudes toward music
Now  if we re going to understand the philosophy  we have to first understand that music for the Greeks was about much more than entertainment  Yes  there was music at festivals and we have sculptures and paintings showing people listening to music for many of the same reasons that we do  But this isn t the whole story
The important thing about music was that it was governed by rules  mathematical rules  And for those of you who are also studying music theory  you ll see that it is in fact highly mathematical
Um…and for the Greeks  the same mathematical principles that govern music also govern the universe as well as the human character  the essence of personality  People s characters were believed to be very sensitive to music  If you started playing around with the rules  you know  messing up the mathematical order  you could do serious harm  That s why music was considered so powerful  If you knew the rules  it could do great good  But if you broke them  you could do great harm to the character of the listener
So  we have this Greek idea that music is directly related to human character and behavior
The philosopher  Plato  talks about this in the context of education  For Plato  music is an important element in education  but only the right kind of music  That means the kind of music that builds the kind of character a good citizen or a future leader would need  Yes  For Plato  there is a kind of music that instills the qualities of leadership  just as there is a kind of music that makes a person soft and weak
Now  Plato has very specific  very conventional kinds of music in mind  He is not fond of innovation  There were musicians in Plato s day who were experimenting with different melodies and rhythms  A definite no no for Plato  He thinks that breaking with tradition leads to all sorts of social problems  serious problems  even the breakdown of the fabric of society  I am thinking back now to when I first started listening to rock  n  roll and I remember my father saying it was a bad influence on us  I think he would have gotten along well with Plato
Anyway  I don t need to tell you what I think about Plato s ideas about innovation  do I  Though I have to say it s interesting that the same arguments against new music and art are still being made  Perhaps like the Greeks  we recognize  and maybe even fear the power of music
