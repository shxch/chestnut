Plant Colonization
Colonization is one way in which plants can change the ecology of a site  Colonization is a process with two components  invasion and survival  The rate at which a site is colonized by plants depends on both the rate at which individual organisms  seeds  spores  immature or mature individuals  arrive at the site and their success at becoming established and surviving  Success in colonization depends to a great extent on there being a site available for colonization – a safe site where disturbance by fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed competing species or reduced levels of competition and other negative interactions to a level at which the invading species can become established  For a given rate of invasion  colonization of a moist  fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that of a dry  infertile site because of poor survival on the latter  A fertile  plowed field is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds  whereas a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse  infertile parent material may remain virtually free of vegetation for many months or even years despite receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed field

     Both the rate of invasion and the rate of extinction vary greatly among different plant species  Pioneer species – those that occur only in the earliest stages of colonization   tend to have high rates of invasion because they produce very large numbers of reproductive propagules  seeds  spores  and so on  and because they have an efficient means of dispersal  normally  wind

If colonizers produce short lived reproductive propagules  they must produce very large numbers unless they have an efficient means of dispersal to suitable new habitats  Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small  relatively short lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means if reaching the appropriate type of habitat  Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants  such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long lived seeds  Many forest plants seem to exhibit the latter adaptation  and viable seeds of pioneer species can be found in large numbers on some forest floors  For example  as many as 1 125 viable seeds per square meter were found in a 100 year old Douglas fir western hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia  Nearly all the seeds that had germinated from this seed bank were from pioneer species  The rapid colonization of such sites after disturbance is undoubtedly in part a reflection of the large seed band on the forest floor

 An adaptation that is well developed in colonizing species is a high degree of variation in germination  the beginning of a seed s growth   Seeds of a given species exhibit a wide range of germination dates  increasing the probability that at least some of the seeds will germinate during a period of favorable environmental conditions  This is particularly important for species that colonize an environment where there is no existing vegetation to ameliorate climatic extremes and in which there may be great climatic diversity

Species succession in plant communities  i e   the temporal sequence of appearance and disappearance of species is dependent on events occurring at different stages in the life history of a species  Variation in rates of invasion and growth plays an important role in determining patterns of succession  especially secondary succession  The species that are first to colonize a site are those that produce abundant seed that is distributed successfully to new sites  Such species generally grow rapidly and quickly dominate new sites  excluding other species with lower invasion and growth rates  The first community that occupies a disturbed area therefore may be composed of specie with the highest rate of invasion  whereas the community of the subsequent stage may consist or plants with similar survival rates but lower invasion rates
1  According to paragraph 1  how does disturbance of a site influence its colonization by a plant species
  Disturbance reduces or eliminates competition by other species
    Disturbance increases negative interactions with other organisms on the site
    Disturbance prevents a plant species from colonizing a new site
     Disturbance reduces the fertility of a site
2  The word  virtually  in the passage is closest in meaning to
     almost totally
    unusually
    consistently
     unnaturally
3  Why does the author mention a plowed field and a construction site in the passage
     To argue that sites that have been affected by human activity tend to be colonized slowly
     To illustrate the kind of sites that may be invaded by weeds
     To contrast sites in terms of their suitability for colonization
     To explain that exposing or compacting the soil results in successful colonization
4  The word  despite  in the passage is closest in meaning to
     without
     almost never
     even though
     perhaps


5  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  The seeds of pioneer species are usually carried by the wind to fertile sites  where they reproduce very efficiently
  Pioneer species are successful invaders because they produce lots of seeds that are dispersed effectively
  Pioneer species produce their largest numbers of propagules during the earliest stages of their colonization
  Pioneer species reproduce very quickly and efficiently because they produce very large number of seeds


6  What can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the reason that large seeds are dispersed by birds or small animals rather than by wind
     Large seeds are easier for birds and animals to see than are the small seeds dispersed by the wind
    Large seeds are too heavy for the wind to disperse
     Large seeds cannot be eaten by birds and animals
     Large seeds are short lived and thus require a more efficient means of dispersal than small seeds do

7  The phrase  the latter adaptation  in the passage refers to
     producing fewer seeds
     producing larger seeds
     dispersal by birds and small mammals
     producing long lived seeds

8  The word  viable  in the passage is closest in meaning to
     able to survive
     individual
     large
     remaining

9  The example of the 100 year old Douglas fir western hemlock forest in paragraph to illustrates which of the following ideas
     It is uncommon for older seed to germinate
     Pioneer species tend to prefer forest floors for colonization purposes
     Long lived seeds of pioneer species can successfully germinate over long periods of time
     Coastal British Columbia is particularly suited for pioneer species to develop





10  According to paragraph 4  how do plants manage to germinate in areas with great climatic diversity and climatic extremes
  By producing seeds only during favorable climatic conditions
     By generating large numbers of seeds
     By colonizing only those areas where other plants have survived
     By producing seeds that have a wide range of germination dates


11  The word  abundant  in the passage is closest in meaning to
     new
     improved
     suitable
  Plentiful

12  According to paragraph 5  which of the following determines the sequence in which plant species will colonize a site
     The extent of growth of a species on a prior site before it begins to colonize a secondary site
     The differences in invasion and growth rates across species
     The degree of fertility of a site
     The kind of disturbance that the site has undergone
13  Look at the four squares〔 〕that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
And yet  how is it that the peasants were able to choose to expand their economic activity in response to the market opportunities
Where does the sentence best fit

14  Prose Summary
   The ecology of a site is changed through its colonization by new plants that arrive and grow there

Answer Choices
 The species that first colonize a disturbed site are typically ones that produce a large number of efficiently dispersed seeds
  Plants that cannot successfully compete with other species can invade and colonize a site only if it is fertile and moist  such as a plowed field
  Pioneer species arrive at a site first but have lower survival rates than do species that arrive later
  Producing seeds that germinate at various time over long periods allows some plants to colonize sites that only occasionally present the right conditions for growth
 Large  long lived seeds tend to result in large seed bank with short germination periods requiring favorable environmental conditions for development
  The successive appearance and disappearance of species on a site is a result of variation in species  rates of invasion  growth  and survival
