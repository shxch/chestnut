Listen to a conversation between a student and a university employee

Student
Hi  I need to pick up a gym pass

Employee
OK  I ll need your name  year  and university ID

Student
Here s my ID card  And my name is Gina Kent  and I m first year

Employee
OK  Gina  I ll type up a pass for you right away

Student
Great  This is exciting  I can t wait to get started

Employee
Oh  this is a wonderful gym

Student
That s what everybody has been saying  Everyone is talking about the new
pool and the new indoor courts  But what I love is all the classes

Employee
The classes…

Student
Yes  like the swimming and tennis classes and everything

Employee
Oh yeah  but this pass doesn t entitle you to those

Student
It doesn t

Employee
No  the classes fall into a separate category

Student
But  that s my whole reason for getting a pass  I mean  I was planning to take a
swimming class

Employee
But that s not how it works  This pass gives you access to the gym and to all the equipment  and to the pool and so forth  But not when the teams are practicing  so you ll have to check the schedule

Student
But what do I have to do if I want to take a class

Employee
You have to  one  register  and two  pay the fee for the class

Student
But that s not fair

Employee
Well  I think if you think about it  You ll see that it s fair

Student
But people who play sports in the gym… they don t have to pay anything

Employee
Yes  but they just come in  and play or swim on their own  But  taking a class   that is a different story  I mean  someone has to pay the instructors

Student
So  if I want to enroll in a class

Employee
Then you have to pay extra  The fee isn t very high  but there s a fee  So  what class did you say you want to take

Student
Swimming…

Employee
OK  Swimming classes are thirty dollars a semester

Student
I guess I could swing that  But I m still not convinced it s fair  So  do I pay you

Employee
Well  first  you need to talk to the instructor  They have to assess your level and steer you to the right class  you know  beginner  intermediate…

Student
You mean  I have to swim for them  Show them what I can do

Employee
No  no  you just tell them a little bit about your experience and skill  so they
know what level you should be in

Student
Oh  OK  So  I guess I ll need an appointment

Employee
And I can make that for you right now  And then I ll type up your gym ID card  You ll need it to get into the building  Now about that appointment… how does Wednesday at three sound

Student
Fine…

Employee
OK  And you ll be meeting with Mark Gettys  He s the swimming instructor  He
also coaches the swim team  And here  I ve jotted it all down for you

Student
Great  Thanks
