Lecture2 Environmental Engineering  APS digestion
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental engineering class
Professor
At the end of yesterday s class  we were discussing landfills and the hundreds of millions of tons of everyday garbage which are deposited into them each year in the United States  It s a growing problem  Quite simply  we are running out of space to put our garbage  And this is especially true for solid organic waste  food scraps from home or food processing plants  waste from farms  that sort of thing  Did you know that two thirds of the waste sitting in our landfills is organic material  We have government recycling programs for materials like plastics  glass and metal  yet widespread solutions for organic waste materials haven t really been addressed in the United States  I think this is just asking for trouble in the future
So today I want to talk about a technology that offers a potential solution to the problem Anaerobic Phased Solids digestion  or APS digestion
First of all  what does anaerobic mean  Anyone
Student
Without oxygen
Professor
Correct  APS digestion uses anaerobic bacteria  ones that thrive in the absence of oxygen  to consume  to break down organic material
Student
Excuse me  Professor  Um…those anaerobic bacteria you are talking about…well  aren t anaerobic bacteria also used in waste water treatment plants
Professor
Yes  They are  Would you like to explain this to the class
Student
Sure  So when waste water is treated  one of the byproducts is a thick liquid called sludge  And aren t anaerobic bacteria used to break down the sludge
Professor
That s right  Anaerobic bacteria have been used in waste water treatment for decades
Student
So how is this technology different
Professor
Good question  The anaerobic digestion systems used in waste water plants are designed to treat sludge  not solids  Now  in the past  researchers have attempted to treat solid organic waste with that same equipment
But there was always a problem
In order to process the solid waste  the kind we find in landfills  you had to pretreat the solids to turn them into sludge
First  by breaking the material apart mechanically into small particles and then adding a lot of water until you got a kind of thick  soupy mix that the equipment could handle  But that extra step took time and required a lot of energy
Student
That sounds like it would cost a lot

Professor
That s right  But APS digestion is designed specifically to handle solid waste  So it is much more cost effective
The new technology processes organic waste in two phases  Remember  APS stands for Anaerobic Phased Solids digestion
First  the waste material is loaded into a large  closed container  along with different types of anaerobic bacteria  The bacteria break the solids down into acids and hydrogen gas  The hydrogen is extracted and the remaining acids are transferred into a different container for the second phase of the process  There another type of bacteria converts the acids into methane gas
Student
Aren t hydrogen and methane gas bad for the environment though
Professor
The answer in this case is no  because they don t escape into the atmosphere  The gases are captured and can be burned to produce electricity  which saves a lot of money and ultimately decreases our need for fuels like petroleum and coal  which are not only expensive but are also polluting
Student
So organic waste from landfills could be processed this way
Professor
It is certainly one possibility  And APS digestion systems are very versatile  They can be installed just about anywhere  See  anaerobic digestion systems used at waste water treatment plants are huge tanks that hold thousands of gallons of waste water  But the APS containers are small enough to be set up on site  where the waste is generated  like at food processing plants or on farms  So garbage doesn t have to be transported long distances  As a matter of fact  a couple of universities successfully set up demonstration projects  They collected food scraps from dining halls and local restaurants and process them in APS facilities  Not only did the university save money  we are also learning even more about the APS process
What is the next step forward
Well  APS digestion uses several different types of anaerobic bacteria  right  So what are the most efficient bacteria in the process  If researchers can figure that out  the highest performing bacteria mix for a system could be determined  Ultimately the goal would be to grow enough of these particular bacteria to support large scale commercial APS systems
