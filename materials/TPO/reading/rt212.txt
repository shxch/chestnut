The Origins of Agriculture
 How did it come about that farming developed independently in a number of world centers  the Southeast Asian mainland  Southwest Asia  Central America  lowland and highland South America  and equatorial Africa  at more or less the same time  Agriculture developed slowly among populations that had an extensive knowledge of plants and animals  Changing from hunting and gathering to agriculture had no immediate advantages  To start with  it forced the population to abandon the nomad s life and become sedentary  to develop methods of storage and  often  systems of irrigation  While hunter gatherers always had the option of moving elsewhere when the resources were exhausted  this became more difficult with farming  Furthermore  as the archaeological record shows  the state of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their contemporary hunter gatherers
 Traditionally  it was believed that the transition to agriculture was the result of a worldwide population crisis  It was argued that once hunter gatherers had occupied the whole world  the population started to grow everywhere and food became scarce  agriculture would have been a solution to this problem  We know  however  that contemporary hunter gatherer societies control their population in a variety of ways  The idea of a world population crisis is therefore unlikely  although population pressure might have arisen in some areas
Climatic changes at the end of the glacial period 13 000 years ago have been proposed to account for the emergence of farming  The temperature increased dramatically in a short period of time  years rather than centuries   allowing for a growth of the hunting gathering population due to the abundance of resources  There were  however  fluctuations in the climatic conditions  with the consequences that wet conditions were followed by dry ones  so that the availability of plants and animals oscillated brusquely
It would appear that the instability of the climatic conditions led populations that had originally been nomadic to settle down and develop a sedentary style of life  which led in turn to population growth and to the need to increase the amount of food available  Farming originated in these conditions  Later on  it became very difficult to change because of the significant expansion of these populations  It could be argued  however  that these conditions are not sufficient to explain the origins of agriculture  Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change  and yet agriculture had not been developed
 It is archaeologist Steven Mithen s thesis  brilliantly developed in his book The Prehistory of the Mind  1996   that approximately 40 000 years ago the human mind developed cognitive fluidity  that is  the integration of the specializations of the mind  technical  natural history  geared to understanding the behavior and distribution of natural resources   social intelligence  and the linguistic capacity  Cognitive fluidity explains the appearance of art  religion  and sophisticated speech  Once humans possessed such a mind  they were able to find an imaginative solution to a situation of severe economic crisis such as the farming dilemma described earlier  Mithen proposes the existence of four mental elements to account for the emergence of farming   1  the ability to develop tools that could be used intensively to harvest and process plant resources   2  the tendency to use plants and animals as the medium to acquire social prestige and power   3  the tendency to develop  social relationships  with animals structurally similar to those developed with people specifically  the ability to think of animals as people  anthropomorphism  and of people as animals  totemism   and  4  the tendency to manipulate plants and animals
    The fact that some societies domesticated animals and plants  discovered the use of metal tools  became literate  and developed a state should not make us forget that others developed pastoralism or horticulture  vegetable gardening  but remained illiterate and at low levels of productivity  a few entered the modern period as hunting and gathering societies  It is anthropologically important to inquire into the conditions that made some societies adopt agriculture while others remained hunter gatherers or horticulturalists  However  it should be kept in mind that many societies that knew of agriculture more or less consciously avoided it  Whether Mithen s explanation is satisfactory is open to contention  and some authors have recently emphasized the importance of other factors



1  The word  option  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 choice
 benefit
 idea
 experience

2  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are advantages of hunting and gathering over agriculture EXCEPT
 It is a healthier lifestyle
 It requires less knowledge of plants and animals
 It does not need storage capabilities
 It is not tied to any specific location


3  The word  therefore  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 in theory
 obviously
 frequently
 as a result

4  Which of the following best describes the way paragraph 2 is organized
 A possible explanation for a phenomenon is presented and then criticized
 Two similar ways of accounting for a puzzling fact are considered
 Early societies  response to a problem is contrasted with contemporary societies  response
 A prehistoric development is first explained in traditional terms and then in contemporary terms





5  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The resources needed by the growing hunting and gathering population increased rapidly once temperatures rose
 Dramatic temperature increases and the simultaneous growth of the hunting and gathering population led to the need for more resources
 Higher temperatures led to the existence of increased resources  thus enabling the hunting and gathering population to grow
 The dramatic temperature increase occurred during the few years when abundant resources allowed the hunting and gathering population to grow

6  According to paragraph 3  the abundance of resources fluctuated sharply after the end of the glacial period because
 locally abundant resources were quickly exhausted by hunter gatherers
 the temperature became much higher in some areas over others
 different types of plants and animals became available as the climate changed
 the amount of rainfall varied radically from one period to the next


7  It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that it was difficult for people to change from farming back to hunting and gathering because
 people had become more used to different types of food
 climatic conditions were no longer favorable for hunting and gathering
 populations had become too large to be supported by hunting and gathering
 the farmer s sedentary life was easier than the hunter gatherer s nomadic life

8  Why does the author state that  Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change  and yet agriculture had not been developed
 To suggest that climate change had occurred long before the development of agriculture
 To argue that climate change does not properly explain why agriculture developed
 To challenge the assumption that agriculture developed only in some parts of the world
 To question the claim that climate change occurred at the time when agriculture developed


	9  The word  imaginative  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 complex
 creative
 immediate
 reliable

	10  According to paragraph 5  Steven Mithen believes that all of the following contributed to the emergence of farming EXCEPT
 the development of a mind flexible enough to come up with solutions to complex problems
 the tendency to use plants and animals to acquire power
 the tendency to emphasize the differences between animals and people
 the ability to make tools that could be used for the large scale harvesting of plants



11  The word  contention  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 investigation
 improvement
 debate
 interpretation

12  According to paragraph 6  which of the following is a weakness of Mithen s explanation
 It does not clearly distinguish agriculture from pastoralism and horticulture
 It fails to explain why some societies adopted agriculture while others did not
 It explains the domestication of plants and animals but not the development of metal tools
 It overlooks the fact that illiteracy and low productivity remain problems even today

It is unclear why hunter gatherers in different parts of the world independently developed agriculture at roughly the same time




Answer Choices

 One obstacle to the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to the sedentary lifestyle required by agriculture was that hunter gatherers had not developed storage techniques
 It seems unlikely that agriculture emerged in response to a food shortage brought on by a worldwide population crisis that developed once the whole world was occupied
 The origins of agriculture maybe linked to climate change at the end of the last ice age  but this does not explain why earlier climatic instability had not led to agriculture
 The only available means of understanding the social organization and technical abilities of ancient hunter gatherer societies is the study of contemporary hunter gatherers
 One recent theory suggests that the invention of agriculture was made possible by the integration of various mental capacities in the human mind
 Little is known about why only some societies that adopted agriculture rapidly progressed to using metal tools  becoming literate  and developing a state
