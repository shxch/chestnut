The Allende Meteorite
Sometime after midnight on February 8  1969  a large  bright meteor entered Earth s atmosphere and broke into thousands of pieces  plummeted to the ground  and scattered over an area 50 miles long and 10 miles wide in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico  The first meteorite from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende  Altogether  roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered  all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery
Individual specimens of Allende are covered with a black  glassy crust that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth s atmosphere  When broken open  Allende stones are revealed to contain an assortment of small  distinctive objects  spherical or irregular in shape and embedded in a dark gray matrix  binding material   which were once constituents of the solar nebula the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which our solar system was formed
The Allende meteorite is classified as a chondrite  Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros meaning  seed  an allusion to their appearance as rocks containing tiny seeds  These seeds are actually chondrules  millimeter sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal  A few chondrules contain grains that survived the melting event  so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when compact masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures approaching 1 700 degrees Celsius and then cooled before these surviving grains could melt  Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly  in times measured in minutes or hours  so the heating events that formed them must have been localized  It seems very unlikely that large portions of the nebula were heated to such extreme temperatures  and huge nebula areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast  Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the nebula that were able to lose heat rapidly  The origin of these peculiar glassy spheres remains an enigma
Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions  irregular white masses that tend to be larger than chondrules  They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth  all rich in calcium  aluminum  and titanium  the most refractory  resistant to melting  of the major elements in the nebula  The same minerals that occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the earliest formed substances to have condensed out of the solar nebula  However  studies of the textures of inclusions reveal that the order in which the minerals appeared in the inclusions varies from inclusion to inclusion  and often does not match the theoretical condensation sequence for those metals
Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix  a mixture of fine grained  mostly silicate minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron sulfide  At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be pristine nebular dust  the sort of stuff from which chondrules and inclusions were made  However  detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it  too  has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula  although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials
All these diverse constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites  like Allende  that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun  To compare the compositions of a meteorite and the Sun  it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than simply the abundances of atoms  After all  the Sun has many more   atoms of any element  say iron  than does a meteorite specimen  but the ratios of iron to silicon in the two kinds of matter might be comparable  The compositional similarity is striking  The major difference is that Allende is depleted in the most volatile elements  like hydrogen  carbon  oxygen  nitrogen  and the noble gases  relative to the Sun  These are the elements that tend to form gases even at very low temperatures  We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun  a sort of solar sludge from which only gases have been removed  Since practically all the solar system s mass resides in the Sun  this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have average solar system composition  except for the most volatile elements  they are truly lumps of nebular matter  probably similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled

 The chondrules were formed of silicate material
 The chondrules were formed at high temperatures and then cooled rapidly
 The grains were formed in huge areas of the solar nebula
 The grains were formed after the chondrules were fused together into chondrites


7  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are true about the minerals found in the refractory inclusions EXCEPT

9  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is indicated by studies of the mixture holding the inclusions together
 Large amounts of this material were formed by condensation or melting in the nebula
 This material contains more iron and iron sulfide than had previously been thought
 This material is very similar to the material from which the refractory inclusions are made
 The grains in this material are made from the same elements as chondrules are






10  In paragraph 6  why does the author mention that  the Sun has many more atoms of any element  say iron  than does a meteorite specimen
 To show how difficult it is to compare the composition of a meteorite with that of the Sun
 To explain why a comparison of the compositions of a meteorite and of the Sun has to be done in terms of ratios of elements
 To identify the most common element in both the Sun and meteorite specimens
 To emphasize how much larger the Sun is than any meteorite specimen is

11  According to paragraph 6  the composition of chondritic meteorites differs from the composition of the Sun   primarily in
 containing nebular matter
 containing many fewer atoms of iron
 the relative amount of volatile elements
 the ratio of iron to silicon

12  According to paragraph 6  what is the significance of the similarity in composition between chondrites and the Sun
 It indicates what the matter from which planets were formed was probably like
 It may explain how the Sun originally developed
 It helps scientists estimate the variations in the chemical composition of different meteors
 It suggests that most meteorites may contain large quantities of volatile elements

Studies of the Allende meteorite provided information about the composition of chondritic meteorites and their possible origin




Answer Choices

 When Allende entered Earth s atmosphere  it broke into thousands of pieces called chondrites because they look like glassy  black seeds
 The mineral content of chondrules suggests that they were probably formed in isolated regions of the nebula that remained much hotter than the rest
 Chondrules are tiny  millimeter sized drops of silicate materials that probably formed when lumps of nebular dust were fused at extremely high temperatures and then quickly cooled
 Irregularly shaped inclusions in Allende are composed of minerals that are resistant to melting and are believed to be the earliest minerals to have condensed out of the nebula
 The matrix that holds the chondrules and inclusions together in Allende consists mainly of grains of nebular dust that were trapped inside the meteor before they could be melted
 Except for being depleted in volatile elements  chondritic meteorites are probably very similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled
