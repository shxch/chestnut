Lecture2 Architecture Reverberation
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an architecture class

Professor
Today I d like to talk a bit about the relationship between the built world and sound  Uh  the design of buildings like concert halls or theaters  So  what s the most important aspect in the design of such a building

Student
Acoustics

Professor
Yes  Now  people have been concerned about how sound carries in auditoriums and theaters for at least 2 000 years  But it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that architectural acoustics became a scientific field  That was when the physicist Wallace Sabine started to do extensive studies on reverberation

Sabine wanted to find out why the audience could not understand speakers at a lecture hall in Boston  He designed a series of studies on reverberation to figure it out  So  what is reverberation  It s the persistence of sound in a room after the source has stopped making sound  You see  sound made in a room reflects off the walls  floors and ceiling  That s the reverberant sound  The time it takes for the reverberant sound to die down is important for the acoustic quality of a room  Sabine recognized this and he came up with an equation to measure a room s reverberation time

So  what happens if the reverberation time is very long

Student
Wouldn t it be difficult to hear new sounds if you can still hear the old sounds

Professor
Exactly  A long reverberation time may cause musical notes to drown one another out

On the other hand  if the reverberation time is very short â€¦ meaning  the reverberations are absorbed very quickly  the room is called dead  Performers would feel they have to struggle to fill the room with sound  We don t want that  In a concert hall or theater  we prefer a live room  where the sound has fullness

So we need to control the reverberation time  After all  we don t want the listeners or the performers have to struggle  right

So what are some important considerations when we design a theater or a concert hall

Student
The size of the place

Professor
Absolutely  The larger the room  the longer the reverberation time  So we ll have to take into account what the room will be mainly used for  since music requires more reverberation than speech  A room intended for music needs to be designed differently from a room intended for drama  For music  we need a very large room  a concert hall  actually I should say for full orchestras  Because for a single instrument  say something like a piano recital  a room with a short reverberation time is better  So for a solo piano a smaller room works well  Yes

Student
I read that concert halls designed for symphony orchestras have too much echo for jazz music

Professor
That doesn t surprise me  Most small jazz groups would need rooms with a shorter reverberation time

But besides the size of the room  another variable affecting reverberation is the shape of the room  Let s say you design a rectangular box like space with bare walls and ceiling  this would allow the sound to act like a ball in a racquetball court  you know  bouncing around and hitting some parts of the walls and ceiling but missing many others  If that happens in a concert hall  audience members may hear some sounds  but not others

So what can be done to distribute the sound evenly in every direction  The answer is  avoid straight  parallel walls

Student
But I think I ve seen photos of rectangular concert halls

Professor
Right  Older concert halls from the 1800s are generally rectangular  But they all have a lot of decorations on the walls inside  lots of ornamental plasterwork like statues  which distribute sound very efficiently  reflecting it in all different directions

And that brings me to another variable we need to consider  The acoustic characteristics of the building materials as well as the wall and floor coverings  In fact  most objects you see in a concert hall or theater serve double duty  The plush chairs absorb sound and soften reverberation  And the beautiful crystal Chandeliers  They are very good at diffusing sound  You see  everything must be planned down to the last detail in order to predict the acoustic performance of a room

That being said  there s something that can t be controlled by the architect  The audience has an effect on acoustics too  The heads of people are good diffusers of sound  And Architects try to account for this effect in their design  but they can t guarantee a full auditorium
