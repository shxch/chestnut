In the last 50 years or so  many American cities have had difficulties in maintaining a successful retail environment  Business owners in the city centers or the downtown areas have experienced some financial losses  because of a steady movement of people out of the cities and into the suburbs  In general  downtown areas  just don t have that many residential areas  not that many people live there  So what have city planners decided to do about it  Well  one way they ve come up with some ways to attract more people  to shop downtown was by creating pedestrian malls

Now  what is a pedestrian mall  It s a pretty simple concept really  it is essentially an outdoor shopping area designed just for people on foot  And… well  unlike many other shopping malls that are built in the suburbs nowadays  these pedestrian malls are typically located in the downtown area of the city  And   oh    there are features like white sidewalks  comfortable outdoor seating and maybe even fountains  and    you know  art  There are variations on this model of course  but the common denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping space that will get people to shop in the city without needing their cars  So I am sure you can see how having an area that s off limits to automobile traffic would be ideal for a heavily populated city where  well  the streets would otherwise be bustling with noisy  unpleasant traffic congestion

Now the
concept which originated in Europe was adopted by American city planners in the late 1950s  And since then  a number of Unites States  cities have created pedestrian malls  And many of them have been highly successful  So what have city planners learned about making these malls succeed

Well  there are two critical factors to consider when creating a pedestrian mall    location and design  Both of which are equally important  Now let s start with the location  In choosing a specific location for a pedestrian mall  there are in fact two considerations  Proximity to potential customers  um…that s we d call a customer base and accessibility to public transportation which we will get to in just a moment

Now  for a customer base  the most obvious example would be a large office building since the employees could theoretically go shopping after work or during their lunch hour  right  Another really good example is convention center which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to draw visitors to the city for major business conferences and events  But ideally  the pedestrian mall would be used by local residents  not just people working in the city or visiting the area  So that s where access to public transportation comes in  either    um   either the designers plan to locate the mall near a central transportation hub  like a bus terminal  a major train or subway station or they work with city officials to create sufficient parking areas  not too far from the mall  which makes sense because if people can t drive into the mall area  well  then they need to have easy access to it  OK  so that s location  but     but what about design  Well  design doesn t necessarily include things like sculptures or decorative walkways or… or even eye catching window displays  you know  art  Although I would be the first to admit those things are aesthetically appealing  however  visually pleasing sights  well  they are not a part of the pedestrian mall design that matter than most  The key consideration is a compact and convenient layout  One which allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes  so they can get to the major stores  resaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns  Now  this takes careful and creative planning

But now what if one ingredient to this planning recipe is missing  There could quite possibly be long lasting effects  And I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in the Louisville Kentucky for instance  Now when the Louisville mall was built  oh  it had lots of visual appeal  it was attractively designed  right in the small part of downtown and it pretty much possessed all of the other design elements for success  But     uh  now  here is where my point about location comes into play  There wasn t a convention center around to     to help draw in visitors  and well  the only nearby hotel eventually closed down for that same reason  Well  you can imagine how this must have affected local and pedestrian mall business owners  Sort of what was we call a chain reaction  It wasn t until a convention center and a parking garage were built about a decade later that the mall started to be successful
