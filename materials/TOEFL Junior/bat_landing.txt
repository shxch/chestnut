Being able to land safely is a critically important skill for all flying animals. Whereas
terrestrial animals face no particular challenge when they need to stop running or crawling,
flying animals move at much higher speeds, and they must be careful about how they land.
Hitting the ground, or even water, at full flight speed would be quite dangerous. Before
touching down, they must decrease their speed in order to land safely. Both bats and birds
have mastered the skill of landing, but these two types of flyers go about it quite differently.
In the past it was believed that, in terms of flying mechanics, there was little difference
between bats and birds. This belief was based only on assumption, however, because for
years nobody had actually studied in graphic detail how bats move their wings. In recent
years, though, researchers have discovered a number of interesting facts about bat flight.
Bats are built differently from birds, and their wings incorporate both their front and
hind limbs. This makes coordinating their limbs more difficult for bats and, as a result,
they are not very good at flying over longer distances. However, they are much better at
maneuverability: a bat can quickly change its direction of flight or completely reverse it,
something a bird cannot easily do.
Another interesting characteristic of bat flight is the way in which bats land—upside
down! Unlike birds, which touch down on the ground or on tree branches, bats can be
observed flying around and then suddenly hanging upside down from an object overhead.
How do they do it? A group of researchers recently used video cameras to film bats landing
on nets suspended from the ceiling of their laboratory and studied the recordings in slow
motion. They painted spots on the bats’ wings to see in detail what happens to the wings
in flight and during touchdown. It turns out that the bats flew in a straight line up to the net
and then quickly flipped over and attached themselves to it upside down. One downside
to this landing routine is that the bats often slam into their landing spot with some force,
which probably causes pain. However, not all bats hit their landing spots with the same
speed and force; these will vary depending on the area where a bat species makes its home.
For example, a cave bat, which regularly perches on a hard stone ceiling, is more careful
about its landing preparation than a bat more accustomed to landing in leafy treetops.
