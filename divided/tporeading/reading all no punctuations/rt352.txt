Population and climate
The human population on Earth has grown to the point that it is having an effect on Earth s atmosphere and ecosystems  Burning of fossil fuels  deforestation  urbanization  cultivation of rice and cattle  and the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons  CFCs  for propellants and refrigerants are increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide  methane  nitrogen oxides  sulphur oxides  dust  and CFCs in the atmosphere  About 70 percent of the Sun s energy passes through the atmosphere and strikes Earth s surface  This radiation heats the surface of the land and ocean  and these surfaces then reradiate infrared radiation back into space  This allows Earth to avoid heating up too much  However  not all of the infrared radiation makes it into space  some is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere and is reradiated back to Earth s surface  A greenhouse gas is one that absorbs infrared radiation and then reradiates some of this radiation back to Earth  Carbon dioxide  CFCs  methane  and nitrogen oxides are greenhouse gases  The natural greenhouse effect of our atmosphere is well established  In fact  without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  scientists calculate that Earth would be about 33°C cooler than it currently is

The current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 360 parts per million  Human activities are having a major influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations  which are rising so fast that current predictions are that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will double in the next 50 to 100 years  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC  report in 1992  which represents a consensus of most atmospheric scientists  predicts that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration would raise global temperatures anywhere between 1 4° C and 4 5°C  The IPCC report issued in 2001 raised the temperature prediction almost twofold  The suggested rise in temperature is greater than the changes that occurred in the past between ice ages  The increase in temperatures would not be uniform  with the smallest changes at the equator and changes two or three times as great at the poles  The local effects of these global changes are difficult to predict  but it is generally agreed that they may include alterations in ocean currents  increased winter flooding in some areas of the Northern Hemisphere  a higher incidence of summer

Scientists are actively investigating the feedback mechanism within the physical  chemical  and biological components of Earth s climate system in order to make accurate predictions of the effects the rise in greenhouse gases will have on future global climates  Global circulation models are important tools in this process  These models incorporate current knowledge on atmospheric circulation patterns  ocean currents  the effect of landmasses  and the like to predict climate under changed conditions  There are several models  and all show agreement on a global scale  For example  all models show substantial changes in climate when carbon dioxide concentration is doubled  However  there are significant differences in the regional climates predicted by different models  Most models project greater temperature increases in mid latitude regions and in mid continental regions relative to the global average  Additionally  changes in precipitation patterns are predicted  with decreases in mid latitude regions and increased rainfall in some tropical areas  Finally  most models predict that there will be increased occurrences of extreme events  such as extended periods without rain  drought   extreme heat waves  greater seasonal variation in temperatures  and increases in the frequency and magnitude of severe storms  Plants and animals have strong responses to virtually every aspect of these projected global changes

The challenge of predicting organismal responses to global climate change is difficult  Partly  this is due to the fact that there are more studies of short term  individual organism responses than there are of long term  systemwide studies  It is extremely difficult  both monetarily and physically  for scientists to conduct field studies at spatial and temporal scales that are large enough to include all the components of real world systems  especially ecosystems with large  freely ranging organisms  One way paleobiologists try to get around this limitation is to attempt to reconstruct past climates by examining fossil life

The relative roles that abiotic and biotic factors play in the distribution of organisms is especially important now  when the world is confronted with the consequences of a growing human population  Changes in climate  land use  and habitat destruction are currently causing dramatic decreases in biodiversity throughout the world  An understanding of climate organism relationships is essential to efforts to preserve and manage Earth s biodiversity
