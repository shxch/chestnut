Green Icebergs

Icebergs are massive blocks of ice  irregular in shape  they float with only about 12 percent of their mass above the sea surface  They are formed by glaciers large rivers of ice that begin inland in the snows of Greenland  Antarctica  and Alaska and move slowly toward the sea  The forward movement  the melting at the base of the glacier where it meets the ocean  and waves and tidal action cause blocks of ice to break off and float out to sea

Icebergs are ordinarily blue to white  although they sometimes appear dark or opaque because they carry gravel and bits of rock  They may change color with changing light conditions and cloud cover  glowing pink or gold in the morning or evening light  but this color change is generally related to the low angle of the Sun above the horizon  However  travelers to Antarctica have repeatedly reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea and  more commonly  close to the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica

One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion when blue ice is illuminated by a near horizon red Sun  but green icebergs stand out among white and blue icebergs under a great variety of light conditions  Another suggestion is that the color might be related to ice with high levels of metallic compounds  including copper and iron  Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores vertical  cylindrical ice samples reaching down to great depths from the glacial ice shelves along the Antarctic continent  Analyses of these cores and samples provide a different solution to the problem

The ice shelf cores  with a total length of 215 meters  705 feet   were long enough to penetrate through glacial ice which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubbles and to continue into the clear  bubble free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the glacial ice  The properties of this clear sea ice were very similar to the ice from the green iceberg  The scientists concluded that green icebergs form when a two layer block of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes  turns upside down   exposing the bubble free shelf ice that was formed from seawater

A green iceberg that stranded just west of the Amery Ice Shelf showed two distinct layers  bubbly blue white ice and bubble free green ice separated by a one meter  long ice layer containing sediments  The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion  Where cracks were present  the color was light green because of light scattering  where no cracks were present  the color was dark green  No air bubbles were present in the green ice  suggesting that the ice was not formed from the compression of snow but instead from the freezing of seawater  Large concentrations of single celled organisms with green pigments  coloring substances  occur along the edges of the ice shelves in this region  and the seawater is rich in their decomposing organic material  The green iceberg did not contain large amounts of particles from these organisms  but the ice had accumulated dissolved organic matter from the seawater  It appears that unlike salt  dissolved organic substances are not excluded from the ice in the freezing process  Analysis shows that the dissolved organic material absorbs enough blue wavelengths from solar light to make the ice appear green

Chemical evidence shows that platelets  minute flat portions  of ice form in the water and then accrete and stick to the bottom of the ice shelf to form a slush  partially melted snow   The slush is compacted by an unknown mechanism  and solid  bubble free ice is formed from water high in soluble organic substances  When an iceberg separates from the ice shelf and capsizes  the green ice is exposed

The Amery Ice Shelf appears to be uniquely suited to the production of green icebergs  Once detached from the ice shelf  these bergs drift in the currents and wind systems surrounding Antarctica and can be found scattered among Antarctica s less colorful icebergs

1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true of icebergs EXCEPT
 They do not have a regular shape
 They are formed where glaciers meet the ocean
 Most of their mass is above the sea surface
 Waves and tides cause them to break off glaciers



2  According to paragraph 2  what causes icebergs to sometimes appear dark or opaque
 A heavy cloud cover
 The presence of gravel or bits of rock
 The low angle of the Sun above the horizon
 The presence of large cracks in their surface



3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 One explanation notes that green icebergs stand out among other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions  but this is attributed to an optical illusion
 One explanation for the color of green icebergs attributes their color to an optical illusion that occurs when the light from a near horizon red Sun shines on a blue iceberg
 One explanation for green icebergs attributes their color to a great variety of light conditions  but green icebergs stand out best among other icebergs when illuminated by a near horizon red Sun
 One explanation attributes the color of green icebergs to an optical illusion under special light conditions  but green icebergs appear distinct from other icebergs under a great variety of light conditions










4  The word  penetrate  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 collect
 pierce
 melt
 endure


5  According to paragraph 4  how is glacial ice formed
 By the compaction of snow
 By the freezing of seawater on the bottom of ice shelves
 By breaking away from the ice shelf
 By the capsizing of a two layer block of shelf ice


6  According to paragraph 4  ice shelf cores helped scientists explain the formation of green icebergs by showing that
 the ice at the bottom of green icebergs is bubble free ice formed from frozen seawater
 bubble free ice is found at the top of the ice shelf
 glacial ice is lighter and floats better than sea ice
 the clear sea ice at the bottom of the ice shelf is similar to ice from a green iceberg
























7  Why does the author mention that  The green ice portion was textured by seawater erosion
 To explain why cracks in the iceberg appeared light green instead of dark green
 To suggest that green ice is more easily eroded by seawater than white ice is
 To support the idea that the green ice had been the bottom layer before capsizing
 To explain how the air bubbles had been removed from the green ice



8  The word  accumulated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 collected
 frozen
 released
 covered


9  The word  excluded  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 kept out
 compressed
 damaged
 gathered together
















10  The word  accrete  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 advance
 transfer
 flatten out
 come together

11  Which of the following is NOT explained in the passage
 Why blocks of ice break off where glaciers meet the ocean
 Why blocks of shelf ice sometimes capsize after breaking off
 Why green icebergs are commonly produced in some parts of Antarctica
 Why green icebergs contain large amounts of dissolved organic pigments

12  The passage supports which of the following statements about the Amery Ice Shelf
 The Amery Ice Shelf produces only green icebergs
 The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because its ice contains high levels of metallic compounds such as copper and iron
 The Amery Ice Shelf produces green icebergs because the seawater is rich in a particular kind of soluble organic material
 No green icebergs are found far from the Amery Ice Shelf



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Scientists have differed as to whether icebergs appear green as a result of light conditions or because of something in the ice itself
Where would the sentence best fit

Several suggestions  ranging from light conditions to the presence of metallic compounds  have been offered to explain why some icebergs appear green










Answer Choices

 Ice cores were used to determine that green icebergs were formed from the compaction of metallic compounds  including copper and iron
 All ice shelves can produce green icebergs  but the Amery Ice Shelf is especially well suited to do so
 Green icebergs form when a two layer block of ice breaks away from a glacier and capsizes  exposing the bottom sea ice to view
