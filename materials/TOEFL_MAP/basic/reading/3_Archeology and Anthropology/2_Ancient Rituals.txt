Ancient Rituals 

A ritual is a ceremony that serves a special purpose. The people who conduct rituals follow specific procedures. Humans have practiced them since ancient times. 

People had rituals for a number of reasons. Some were for worshipping gods. For instance, many tribes sacrificed animals to their gods. Sheep and oxen were some animals that were commonly used. Others, such as the Aztecs, a Central American tribe, performed human sacrifices. 

A large number of rituals related to farming. In spring, many societies held ceremonies that were done to ensure good farming conditions. Some were meant to make the soil fertile. Others were done to bring rain. In fall, farmers thought that some rituals would make their harvests bountiful. 

Ancient people had rituals for other events as well. These included marriages, births, and funerals. And warrior cultures often held rituals both before and after the battles they fought.
