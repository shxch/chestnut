Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a Professor and a Student

Professor
Jeff  I m glad you drop by  I ve been meaning to congratulate you on the class leadership
award

Student
Thanks Professor Brownson  I was really happy to get it and a little surprised  I mean  there were so many other people nominated

Professor
Well  I know the award was well deserved  Now  what can I do for you today

Student
I needed to talk to you about the medieval history test you know  the one scheduled for
Friday afternoon

Professor
Yes

Student
Well  there is this trip that my French class is taking  We are going to Montreal for the weekend

Professor
Montreal  That s my favorite city  What ll you be seeing there

Student
I m not sure yet  Well  the reason  the main reason I wanted to go is that we ll be rooming with French speaking Students there  you know  so we can get a chance to use our French  to actually talk with real French speakers

Professor
It sounds like a good opportunity  But then  there is that test

Student
Yeah    but   well  the thing is the bus leaves right in the middle of when our history class meets this Friday  So  well  I was thinking maybe I could take the test on a different day like Monday morning during your office hours

Professor
Eh   Monday morning   um   that would not be   oh wait  let me just see one thing  Aha  okay  That s what I thought  So  for your class  I was planning a take home exam so you could just take the test along with you  Let s see  I guess you could come to class Friday just to pick up the test  That way you d still make your bus  and then find some quiet time during your trip to complete it and you can bring it to class Wednesday when I ll be collecting everyone else s

Student
Hmm     um   during the trip  well  I guess I could  So I should plan to take my books and
stuff with me

Professor
You ll definitely need your class notes  I m giving you several short essay questions to make you think critically about the points we ve discussed in class  to state    uh state and defend your opinion  analyze the issues  speculate about how things might have turned out differently  So  you see  I don t care if you look updates and that kind of thing  What I want is for you to synthesize information to reflect back on what we ve read and discussed and to form your own ideas  not just repeat points from the textbook  Does that make sense

Student
Yeah  I think so  You are looking for my point of view

Professor
That s right  The mid term exam showed me that you know all the details of who  where and when  For this test  I want to see how you can put it all together to show some original thinking

Student
That s sounds pretty challenging  especially trying to work it into this trip  But  yeah  I think I can do it

Professor
I m sure you can

Student
Thank you  Professor Brownson

Professor
Have a great time in Montreal
