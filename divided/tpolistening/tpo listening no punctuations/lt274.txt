Conversation2 Hydroponics  Chinampas

Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and the professor of his history of technology class

Student
Would it be okay to focus on something related to agriculture

Professor
Sure  farming technology is fine  as long as it s pre modern  But this isn t a long paper  so are you going to need to pick a specific area of pre modern agriculture  like irrigation or food crops of ancient Greece

Student
I am actually interested in hydroponics

Professor
Hydroponics  Growing plants in water instead of soil

Student
Well  not in pure water  in water that has the proper mix of nutrients

Professor
OK  But is it a pre modern technology  I mean  hydroponics isn t really my specialty but from the research I have read  we are talking the nineteenth century  maybe the seventeenth century if you really stretch it

Student
Oh  But the Aztec civilization back in the thirteenth century in basically where Mexico city is today … An article I read said the Aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called … I have got the word right here  Um  Chinampas

Professor
Chinampas  the so called floating gardens

Student
Exactly  So yeah the chinampas  the article said very clearly these floating gardens are proof that the Aztec invented hydroponic farming

Professor
Well  chinampas are artificial islands built up in shallow lakes  Islands made from packed earth and weeds and uh  material from the bottom of the lake  They may have appeared to be floating in the water  but in fact they reach all the way to the bottom of the lake  So the primary growing medium  what the plants draw nutrients from  is actually soil  not water

Student
So the article was wrong about that  Too bad  it seems like a great topic  but I guess…

Professor
Wait a minute  Just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn t mean this couldn t be an appropriate topic for your paper  Chinampas were still a great technological achievement  I mean  they enabled the Aztecs to grow plenty of food in an area without much available farmland

Student
But I wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic

Professor
Well it s pretty common for writers to generalize  say use a term like hydroponics to describe other types of agriculture  Personally  I would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in liquid  The crops on chinampas definitely benefited from the water surrounding them  But… hydroponic…

Student
OK  So I will go with chinampas but leave out with the hydroponics part


Professor
Actually  there s an important lesson here  We should pay attention to what happened in history but also how historical events are presented  Why  for example  would writers use a word like hydroponics so casually

Student
I guess  cause it s a popular topic people want to read about

Professor
Or to help modern day readers to understand something historical  maybe these writers think a familiar frame of reference is needed

Student
Well that article was in a popular magazine  not a scholarly journal for historians

Professor
OK  But historians sometimes do the same thing

Student
So I guess then that all historians might not describe chinampas in quite the same way either

Professor
Good point  Why not look into that too  And include it along with your description and analysis
