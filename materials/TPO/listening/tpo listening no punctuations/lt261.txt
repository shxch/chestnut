Listen to a conversation between a student and a university print shop employee
Student
Hi  I saw your ad in the campus newspaper
Employee
Oh  We don t have any job opening right now
Student
Oh  no  I meant the other ad  about the services you provide for students  You see  I have been working at the campus tutoring center as a math tutor  But things have changed  including my schedule  And now I want to start doing tutoring work independently  But in order to  basically  start my own business  I need to get the work out
Employee
Ok
Student
I was thinking I should get something printed up that I can hand out to people
Employee
Ah  Well  actually  I just printed up some great looking flyers for someone doing the same thing
Student
Flyers  Yeah  that s an idea  I guess then I could post them around the campus
Employee
Yeah  And you can hand them out too  But  oh  you know what  I did something really neat for someone last week  She didn t want to go the traditional route  you know  business cards  flyers  so we customized pencils for her
Student
Pencils
Employee
Yeah  You know  a little message printed on the pencil
Student
Oh  that s cool
Employee
Yeah  But you should know  it s not our cheapest option  Oh  and you know those little sticky notes
Student
You do those too
Employee
Well  we did once  I think those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters  You know  student use them all the time  so they should be good for business  I don t know why we haven t done more
Student
Wow
Employee
So you ve got some options
Student
Right  Well  what about business cards  My friend has these business cards  She does tutoring too  And she got them at this place in town  but they were kind of expensive
Employee
For business card  Well  I don t know what your friend paid  But we could do something real simple and it wouldn t be much  Like for a batch of 250 for one of our standard designs  20 dollars maybe
Student
20 dollars sounds okay
Employee
Now  there are some other choices that ll affect the cost  You know  like different background patters  using color ink  that sort of thing  And it also depends on how many words you want to include
Student
Ok  Well  I know what I want them to say  But I am just thinking  I kind of like that pencil idea
Employee
Yeah  I thought it was neat  Now  of course you can only fit your name and phone number  and like  in your case  math tutoring on it
Student
Right  Well  I could custom design the business cards through  right  That s what my friend did  She said she designed them at the computer right there at the print shop
Employee
Well  you can do that here too  But a custom design would be a bigger investment for your business than one of our standard designs
Student
Well  I don t know  I am interested in business cards  so can I look at the standard designs
