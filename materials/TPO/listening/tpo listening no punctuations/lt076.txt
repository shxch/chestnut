TPO 7 Lecture 4 Geology
Last time  we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow  and some of you were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are  Now  even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass of ice can move or flow  it s another word for it  it s really known that no secret that the glaciers flow because of gravity  But how they flow  the way they flow  needs some explaining

Now  the first type of glacier flow is called  basal slip  Basal slip or sliding as it s often called  basically refers to the slipping or sliding of a glacier across bedrock  actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock  So  this process shouldn t be too hard to imagine  What happens is that the ice at the base of the glacier is under a great deal of pressure   the pressure coming from the weight of the overlying ice  And you probably know that under pressure  the melting temperature of water  of the ice I mean  is reduced  So  ice at the base of the glacier melts  even though it s below zero degree Celsius  And this results in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground  This layer of water reduces friction is    is like a lubricant  And it allows the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock  OK

Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called  deformation  You v already known that ice is brittle  if you hit it with a hammer  it will shatter like glass  But ice is also plastic  it can change shape without breaking  If you leave  for example  a bar of ice supported only at one end  the end  the unsupported end will deform under its own weight  it ll kind of flatten out at one end  get distorted  deformed  Think of deformation as a very slow oozing  Depending on the stresses on the glacier  the ice crystal within it reorganize  And during this re organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to slide pass each other  And so the glacier oozes downhill without any ice actually melting

Now  there are a couple of factors that affect the amount of deformation that takes place or the speed of the glacier s movement for example  Deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ice is  because of the gravity of the weight of the ice  And temperature also plays a part here  in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the melting point  in fact  it is not too different from… the way oil is  thicker at lower temperatures  So  if you have a glacier in a slightly warmer region  it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region

Ok  um… Now  I d like to touch briefly on extension and compression  Your textbook includes these as types  as a particular type of glacier movement  but you will see that there are …as many textbooks that omit it as a type of movement as include it  And I might not include it right now  if it weren t in your textbook  But  basically  the upper parts of glaciers have less pressure on them  So  they don t deform easily  they tend to be more brittle  And crevasses can form in this upper layers of the glacier  When the glacier comes into contact with bedrock walls or is otherwise under some kind of stress  but can t deform quickly enough  So  the ice would expand or constrict  and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice  and that brittle surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of glacier movement depending on which source you are consulting

Now  as you probably know  glaciers generally move really slowly  But sometimes  they experience surges  and during these surges  in some places  they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year  Now  speeds like that are pretty unusual  hundreds of times faster than the regular movement of glaciers  but you can actually see glacier move during these surges  though it is rare
