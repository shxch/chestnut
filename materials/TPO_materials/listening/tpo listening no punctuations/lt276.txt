OK  As you probably know  primary colors are  theoretically speaking  the basic colors from which all other colors can be made  But as you ll find out when you start working on your painting projects  the three primary colors – red  blue  yellow – don t always make the best secondary colors  Combining red and blue  you will probably never get a fantastic violet  To get a nice violet  you ll have to add white  Combining yellow and blue  you will almost never get a satisfactory green  You are better off using a pure green pigment

The idea of primary colors  and specifically the idea of red  yellow and blue being THE primary colors  didn t exist until about 200 years ago  Until then  the dominant theory about color was one that had been proposed by Isaac Newton  Newton gave a scientific and objective explanation of colors  He used a prism to break white light down into the various colors of the spectrum  And he theorized  rightly so  that different colors are essentially different wavelengths of light  But he made no mention of primary colors  That idea came from  or was at least published by a man named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Goethe was a well known author  He wrote many famous novels  plays  poems  So why did he start thinking about colors

Well Goethe was part of the Romantic Movement in western literature  And he was a Romantic  through and through  meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual  emotional impact they had  as opposed to explaining them in terms of their scientific nature  He rejected an objective understanding of color  in favor of a more subjective understanding  He believed that when we see color  it stimulates our emotions  And different colors appeal to or inspire different emotions in different people

That sounds like psychology

Professor

Well  color theory is used in psychology too  Some psychologists do use their field s version of color theory to diagnose and treat patients  Um… anyway  Goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to figure out which colors corresponded to which emotions  And in terms of that goal  he wasn t very successful  But his experiments actually did show a lot about the relationships between colors themselves  about how colors change when placed next to other colors  about how they interact with one another  Scientists studying optics and chromatics today still marvel at his findings  But Goethe wasn t really able to establish a clear connection between colors and emotions

Then in 1806  he received a letter from a relatively unknown German artist  a painter named Philipp Otto Runge  In the letter  Runge outlined his own color theory  specifically the connections he made between colors and emotions  And his ideas about what colors symbolize  about the emotions that different colors inspire were based on the colors red  yellow and blue  Runge s choice of red  yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern day chromatics  it had to do with Runge s complex system of symbolism  his experience of nature  particularly with his experience of the quality of light at various times of the day  morning  noon and night  So each color had a specific symbolic value

Well  four years later  Goethe published a book entitled Color Lesson  In Color Lesson  Goethe COINCIDENTLY cites the same colors as primary colors  At this point  Goethe was already a well known author  so he was easily able to popularize this idea of primary colors  and specifically the idea of red  yellow and blue as THE primary colors

But he didn t mention Runge

Professor

Well  he did put Runge s letter in the book  at the end  But he added a disclaimer implying that Runge s letter didn t influence his work  Apparently  what Goethe was saying was that they just HAPPENED TO come up with the same theory at the same time
