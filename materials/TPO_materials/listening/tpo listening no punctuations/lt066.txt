Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class

Professor
We re really just now beginning to understand how quickly drastic climate change can take place  We can see past occurrences of climate change that took place over just a few hundred years

Take uh… the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa  The Sahara was really different 6 000 years ago  I mean  you wouldn t call it a tropical paradise or anything  uh…or maybe you would if you think about how today in some parts of the Sahara it…it only rains about once a century  Um… but basically  you had greenery and you had water

And what I find particularly interesting    amazing really  what really indicates how undesert like the Sahara was thousands of years ago  was something painted on the rock  prehistoric art  hippopotamuses  as you know hippos need a lot of water and hence  Hence what

Student
They need to live near a large source of water year around

Professor
That s right

Student
But how is that proof that the Sahara used to be a lot wetter  I mean the people who painted those hippos  well  couldn t they have seen them on their travels

Professor
Okay  in principle they could  Karl  But the rock paintings aren t the only evidence  Beneath the Sahara are huge aquifers  basically a sea of fresh water  that s perhaps a million years old filtered through rock layers  And…er…and then there is fossilized pollen  from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara  In fact these plants still grow  er…but hundreds of miles away  in more vegetated areas  Anyway  it s this fossilized pollen along with the aquifers and the rock paintings  these three things are all evidence that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today  that there were hippos and probably elephants and giraffes and so on

Student
So what happened

Professor
How did it happen  Well  Now  we re so used to hearing about how human activities are affecting the climate  right  But that takes the focus away from the natural variations in the earth climate  like the Ice Age  right  The planet was practically covered in ice just a few thousand years ago  Now as far as the Sahara goes  there is some recent literature that points to the migration of the monsoon in that area

Students
Huh

Professor
What do I mean  Okay  a monsoon is a seasonal wind that can bring in a large amount of rainfall  Now if the monsoon migrates  well  that means that the rains move to another area  right

So what caused the monsoon to migrate  Well  the answer is  the dynamics of earth s motions  the same thing that caused the Ice Age by the way  The earth s not always the same distance from the sun  and it s not always tilting toward the sun at the same angle  There are slight variations in these two parameters  They re gradual variations but their effects can be pretty abrupt  And can cause the climate to change in just a few hundred years

Student
That s abrupt

Professor
Well  yeah  considering that other climate shifts take thousands of years  this one is pretty abrupt  So these changes in the planet s motions  they caused the climate to change

But it was also compounded  What the Sahara experienced was uh…a sort of  runaway drying effect   As I said the monsoon migrated itself  so there was less rain in the Sahara  The land started to get drier  which in turn caused a huge decrease in the amount of vegetation  because vegetation doesn t grow as well in dry soil  right  And then  less vegetation means the soil can t hold water as well  the soil loses its ability to retain water when it does rain  So then you have less moisture to help clouds form  nothing to evaporate for cloud formation  And then the cycle continues  less rain  drier soil  less vegetation  fewer clouds  less rain etc  etc

Student
But  what about the people who made the rock paintings

Professor
Good question  No one really knows  But there might be some connections to ancient Egypt  At about the same time that the Sahara was becoming a desert…hmm    5 000 years ago  Egypt really began to flourish out in the Nile River valley  And that s not that far away  So it s only logical to hypothesize that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile valley when they realized that this was more than a temporary drought  And some people take this a step further  And that s okay  that s science and they hypothesize that this migration actually provided an important impetus in the development of ancient Egypt  Well  we ll stay tuned on that
