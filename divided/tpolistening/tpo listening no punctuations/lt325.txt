Lecture3 Earth Science  the Copper Basin
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class  The professor is discussing an area of the United States called the Copper Basin

Professor
Now  you may not have heard of the Copper Basin  It s in the Eastern United States  in the Tennessee River Valley  It got its name because settlers discovered copper there in 1843  And soon afterwards  it supported one of the largest metal mining operations in America  At one time  four mining companies employed 2500 workers in the Copper Basin  For that time period  it was a huge operation
Well  this mining operation turned the Copper Basin into a desert  In the 1840s  when mining operations started  it was a dense green forest  But in the 1940s  100 years later  it was as barren as the moon
Efforts to reclaim the land and restore the basin to the fertile valley it once was…well  actually  those efforts are still ongoing  It s been a long and tedious process  In fact  it was many years before any results were seen  Copper mining had gone on there for more than 90 years  The damage couldn t be reversed overnight
Although I should mention that by 1996  the water in one of the rivers flowing through the basin was clean enough that it was the site of the Olympic white water kayaking competition  And that river is still used now for recreation
But…anyway…let s analyze the problem  It wasn t the mining itself that caused such massive destruction  It was what happened after the copper ore was extracted from the mines  It was a process called heap roasting
Copper ore contains sulfur  And heap roasting was a way to burn away the sulfur in the copper  so they d be left with something closer to pure copper  Well  in the process  large vats of raw copper ore are burned slowly  for two or three months actually  to lower the sulfur content  And this burning  well…let s look at the results
First  the mines were fairly remote  so there was no way to bring coal or other fuel to keep the fires going  So they cut down local trees for fuel  And like I said  the fires burned for months  Uh…that s a lot of fires and a lot of trees  Deforestation was occurring at a rapid rate  And it was accelerated by the smoke from the burning ore  Big clouds of sulfuric smoke  which was toxic to the trees  formed over the areas  Trees that hadn t been cut for fuel were killed by the fumes
The sulfur also mixed with the air and created sulfur dioxide  And the sulfur dioxide settled in the clouds fell to the land in droplets of rain and sank into the soil  This is what we now call acid rain  You ve probably heard of it  But no one used the term back then  Anyway…the acid rain created highly acidic soil  Well  soon the soil became so acidic that nothing could grow  nothing at all  Vegetation and wild life disappeared
And it wasn t just the land and the air  it was the water too  What do you think happen to the rivers  Well  there are no trees to absorb the rain  and there was a lot of rain  So the rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers  This is called silting  when soil particles are washed into the rivers  And the silting continued at an alarming rate  But this was toxic soil and toxic runoff  the acid and metals in the soil made the once clear rivers flow bright orange
So it was really that one step in the process of producing copper…the problems just built up and up until there was a desert where a beautiful forest used to be
OK  Now let s look at reforestation and land reclamation efforts
