The Master-Apprentice Relationship

In Europe during medieval times, not everyone was a farmer. Some people were skilled artisans. There were carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, silversmiths, blacksmiths, and bakers. People skilled at these jobs were called masters. They often had apprentices. These were young boys—and sometimes girls—who trained with a master to learn his job. Apprentices studied with their masters for many years. They learned all that they could about their jobs. After a long time, they became masters. Then, they trained their own apprentices. This way, skills were passed down from one generation to another.

Most apprentices began their training as children or teens. They lived with their masters. Their masters provided food, clothing, and shelter. The apprentices, in turn, gave their masters free labor. They received no wages while training. Most apprentices studied for seven years. After completing their studies, they became journeymen. This meant that they were skilled but not yet qualified to be considered masters. Journeymen were able to earn money by using their talents though. But they still had to practice for a few more years. Then, they could become masters.

During the Middle Ages, most places had strict rules concerning the standards for apprentices, journeymen, and masters. Guilds controlled these professions. Guilds were associations of tradesmen. There was usually a guild for each type of craft. Only a master could join one. To become a master, a journeyman had to pass a test. This mainly involved producing an example of his or her work. The masters of the guild then judged the work. In this way, the guild could ensure that the quality of its members was high.
