Earth s surface is not made up of a single sheet of rock that forms a crust but rather a number of  tectonic plates  that fit closely  like the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle  Some plates carry islands or continents others form the seafloor  All are slowly moving because the plates float on a denser semi liquid mantle  the layer between the crust and Earth s core  The plates have edges that are spreading ridges  where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created   subduction zones  where two plates collide and one plunges beneath the other   or transform faults  where two plates neither converge nor diverge but merely move past one another   It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth s volcanism and earthquake activity occur

Generally speaking  the interiors of plates are geologically uneventful  However  there are exceptions  A glance at a map of the Pacific Ocean reveals that there are many islands far out at sea that are actually volcanoes    many no longer active  some overgrown with coral    that originated from activity at points in the interior of the Pacific Plate that forms the Pacific seafloor

How can volcanic activity occur so far from a plate boundary  The Hawaiian Islands provide a very instructive answer  Like many other island groups  they form a chain  The Hawaiian Islands Chain extends northwest from the island of Hawaii  In the 1840s American geologist James Daly observed that the different Hawaii islands seem to share a similar geologic evolution but are progressively more eroded  and therefore probable older  toward the northwest  Then in 1963  in the early days of the development of the theory of plate tectonics  Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface plate moving over a fixed volcanic source in the interior  Wilson suggested that the long chain of volcanoes stretching northwest from Hawaii is simply the surface expression of a long lived volcanic source located beneath the tectonic plate in the mantle  Today s most northwest island would have been the first to form  Then as the plate moved slowly northwest  new volcanic islands would have forms as the plate moved over the volcanic source  The most recent island  Hawaii  would be at the end of the chain and is now over the volcanic source

Although this idea was not immediately accepted  the dating of lavas in the Hawaii  and other  chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano  just as Daly had suggested  Wilson s analysis of these data is now a central part of plate tectonics  Most volcanoes that occur in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by mantle plumes  columns of molten rock that rise from deep within the mantle  A volcano remains an active  hot spot  as long as it is over the plume  The plumes apparently originate at great depths  perhaps as deep as the boundary between the core and the mantle  and many have been active for a very long time  The oldest volcanoes in the Hawaii hot spot trail have ages close to 80 million years  Other islands  including Tahiti and Easter Islands in the pacific  Reunion and Mauritius in the India Ocean  and indeed most of the large islands in the world s oceans  owe their existence to mantle plumes

The oceanic volcanic islands and their hot spot trails are thus especially useful for geologist because they record the past locations of the plate over a fixed source  They therefore permit the reconstruction of the process of seafloor spreading  and consequently of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past  For example  given the current position of the Pacific Plate  Hawaii is above the Pacific Ocean hot spot  So the position of The Pacific Plate 50 million years ago can be determined by moving it such that a 50 million year old volcano in the hot spot trail sits at the location of Hawaii today  However because the ocean basins really are short lived features on geologic times scale  reconstruction the world s geography by backtracking along the hot spot trail works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic time

 Volcanic activity is responsible for the formation of the Pacific seafloor in the interior of the Pacific Plate
 Many volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean are no longer active and have become islands that support coral
 There are many islands in the Pacific Ocean that originated as volcanoes in the interior of the Pacific Plate
 The map of the Pacific Ocean reveals fewer volcanic islands than there truly are because many are no longer active and some are completely overgrown with coral

 familiar

5  The word  eroded  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 worm down

6  In paragraph 3  what is the relationship between the scientific contribution of James Daly and Tuzo Wilson
 Wilson provided an explanation for the observations made by Daly
 Wilson challenged the theory proposed by Daly
 Wilson found numerous examples of island chains that supported Daly s theory
 Wilson popularized the explanation of volcanic island formation formulated by Daly






7  Why does the author provide the information that  the dating of lavas in the Hawaii  and other  chains showed that their ages increase away from the presently active volcano
 To point out differences between the Hawaii island chain and other volcanic island chains
 To question the idea that all the islands in an island chain have been formed by volcanic activity
 To explain why Wilson hypothesis was initially difficult to accept
 To provide evidence in support of Daly s and Wilson s ideas about how the Hawaii islands were formed

8  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of mantle plumes
 They exist close to the surface of tectonic plates
 They cause most of the volcanic activity that occurs in the interiors of plates
 They are rarely active for long period of time
 They get increasingly older away from the present hot spots



9  According to paragraph 5  volcanic islands help geologists to
 reconstruct past geography
 detect changes in mantle plumes
 measure the rigidity of tectonic plates
 explain why the seafloor spreads

10  What can be inferred about the Pacific Plate from paragraph 5
 The hot spots on the Pacific Plate are much older than the ones located on the other tectonic plates
 Most of the volcanic sources beneath the Pacific Plate have become extinct
 The Pacific Plate has moved a distance equal to the length of the Hawaiian Island chain in the past 80 million years
 The Pacific Plate is located above fewer mantle plumes than other plates are

11  The word  current  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 original
 ideal
 relative
 present

12  According to paragraph 5  why are geologists unable to trace back the entire geologic of continents from hot spot trails
 Hot spots have existed for only about 5 percent of geologic time
 Hawaii did not exist 50 million years ago
 Oceanic basins that contained old hot spot trails disappeared a long time ago
 Hot spot trails can be reconstructed only for island chains




13 Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
This pattern remained unexplained for a long time
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points


Although volcanic activity is concentrated on the edge of tectonic plates  such activity can occur in the interiors of plates as well






Answer Choices

 Our understanding of islands comes from Daly s and Wilson s observations of the Hawaiian Islands  which was later confirmed by plate tectonic theory
 The hot spot trails formed by volcanic island chains indicate the positions of tectonic plates as far back as the present ocean basins have existed
 Whereas volcanic islands formed by mantle plumes are typically small  most of the world s largest islands are formed at the edges of tectonic plates
 It has only recently been discovered that tectonic plates are closely fitting rather than loosely constructed  as geologist previously believed
 Volcanic island chains such as the Hawaiian Islands form in the interior of a tectonic plate as the plate moves over a fixed volcanic source in the mantle
 The Pacific Plate has existed for as long as the Hawaiian Islands have existed  namely for more than 80 million years
