Well-known in many countries, tug-of-war is a sports event with easy rules and a lot
of action. On a grassy field, two teams pull on opposite ends of a rope. The team that can
pull the other team to its side of the field triumphs. Many places have local tug-of-war
clubs that compete against each other. An international organization sets the rules of the
competition.

If one tug-of-war team weighs much more than the other team, then it is easier for
the heavier team to win. To keep contests fair, all eight pullers on a team must be
weighed. Only teams with similar weights compete against each other.

The thrill of tug-of-war has been known for a very long time. In fact, it is one of the
worldâ€™s oldest events, going back many centuries. Tug-of-war existed in many places in
ancient times, including Greece, Egypt, and Korea. At one point it was even included in
the Olympic Games. It was introduced into the Olympics in 1900, just four years after
the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Greece. It was a part of the
Olympics until 1920, when the rope was pulled for the final time as an official Olympic
event.
