Lecture4 Architectural History  Irwin & Hexagonal House
Listen to part of a lecture in an architectural history class

Professor
So last week we started our unit on residential architecture in the United States  So today we ll be surveying a number of architects who made contributions to residential architecture in the 19th century
Now  it s worth noting that people who designed homes at that time probably had to deal with a certain amount of discouragement  Since there were other architects who thought it was more respectable to design the kind of buildings…and maybe other structures…that were less…less utilitarian in their function  In fact  an article from an 1876 issue of a journal called The American Architect and Building News stated that  and this is a quote  they stated that  the planning of houses isn t architecture at all
So keep that journal article in mind as we look at the work of an architect named Harriet Morrison Irwin  Harriet Morrison Irwin was from the South  born in North Carolina in 1828  At the time  there weren t many architects from the southern United States   And as you might imagine  very few of them were women  So Irwin was really a pretty exceptional case  And she wasn t even formally trained as an architect  Her educational background was in literature  The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928
Yes  Vicky
Student
So she just had like…unnatural gift for architecture
Professor
Yes  She was actually a writer for several years  But she did have a penchant for math and engineering  so she read a lot about it on her own  Um…especially the architectural essays written by the British critic – John Ruskin  And John Ruskin believed what
?
Student
Um…that buildings should have a lot of access to the outdoors  to nature  Ruskin said that being close to nature was great for people s mental and physical health
Professor
Right  So that was an influence
Now  Harriet Irwin s contribution to architecture was relatively minor but still quite interesting and unique  She designed a house with a hexagonal shape  Josh
Student
A house with six sides  Instead of the standard  you know  four sided home
Professor
Yeah  The rooms inside the house were also hexagonal  six sided  So one important thing was that the rooms were arranged around a chimney in the center of the house  which could provide heat for the whole house through flues  uh  small air passageways into each room  as opposed to having a fireplace in every room  which would require more cleaning and make the air inside the house dirtier
The house s shape also allowed for more windows  Each room had a large wall that could fit a couple of big winters  giving every room a nice view of the outdoors
Student
Plus there would be good airflow through the house
Professor
Yes  In warm weather when you can open all the windows  Good

The doors to the house as well…uh…the house didn t have a main entrance or any hallways  So there could be a couple of entry doors in different places  which like the windows  provided ready access to the outdoors
So  what other advantages might there be to hexagonal rooms
 Pause…no response
OK  Think about cleaning  What part of a room is usually the hardest to clean  Like…to sweep with a broom
Student
Oh  The corners  Because in square or rectangular rooms  the corners are at 90 degree angles  It s hard to reach all the dust that gathers in the corners  But if Irwin s rooms were closer to a circle than a square  it would be easier to reach all the dust and dirt with a broom  Right
Professor
Exactly
Now  um…biographers who wrote about Irwin in the 19th century  I feel  sort of downplayed the ingenuity of her design  But I think if she had designed this house today  the same biographers would praise her for coming up with a floor plan that emphasized function  efficient function of a house  as well as a design that s creative and unique
In any cases  three houses were built in Irwin s time that used her hexagonal design  And in 1869  when she was 41  Irwin became the first woman in the United States to receive a patent for an architectural design  And that speaks volumes  if you ask me
