TPO 14 Conversation 2

Narrator

Listen to a conversation between a student and his faculty adviser

Advisor
Hi  Steve  I scheduled this appointment  cause it has been a while since we touched base

Student

I know I have been really busy    a friend of mine works on the school paper  He asks me if I would like to try reporting so I did and I really love it

Advisor
Hey…that s sounds great

Student

Yeah… the first article I wrote  it was a profile of the chemistry professor   the one who was named Teacher of the Year  My article ran on the front page  When I saw my name  I mean my byline in print  I was hooked  Now I know this is what I want to do    be a reporter

Advisor

Isn t it great to discover something that you really enjoy  And I read that the article too  It was very good

Student

To be honest  the article got lots of editing  In fact I barely recognized a couple of paragraphs  But the editor explained why the changes were made  I learned a lot and my second article didn t need nearly as many changes

Advisor

Sounds like you ve got a real knack for this

Student

Yeah… anyway  I am glad you scheduled this meeting  cause I want to change my major to journalism now

Advisor
Um    the university doesn t offer a major in journalism

Student

Oh no…

Advisor

But…

Student

I… I mean… should I transfer to another school  or major in English

Advisor
Well… wait a minute  Let me explain why the major isn t offered  Editors at newspaper… editors… I mean when you apply for a reporting job  editors look at two things    they want to see clips  you know  some of your published articles  they ll also want you to try out  they ll give you an assignment like… covering a press conference or some other event  then see if you can craft a story about it  accurately  on deadline

Student

So they don t even look at my major

Advisor

It is not that they don t look at it… it is… well  having a degree in something other than journalism should actually work to your advantage

Student
How

Advisor

Most journalists specialize these days  They only write about science or business or technology for example  Is there a type of reporting you think you may like to specialize in

Student

Well… I think it d be really cool to cover the Supreme Court  I mean… their decisions
affect so many people

Advisor

That is really a goal worth striving for  So  why not continue major in political science  And as electives  you could take some Pre Law classes like Constitutional Law  and as for your work on the student newspaper  maybe they d let you cover some local court cases    ones that students and professors here would want to read about

Student
Do you know of any？

Advisor
I do  Actually  there is case involving this computer software program that one of our professors wrote  The district court is deciding if the university is entitled to any of the professor s profits

Student
Wow…  I will definitely follow up on that
