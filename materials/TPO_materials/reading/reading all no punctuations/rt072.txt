Ancient Rome and Greece
There is a quality of cohesiveness about the Roman world that applied neither to Greece nor perhaps to any other civilization  ancient or modern  Like the stone of Roman wall  which were held together both by the regularity of the design and by that peculiarly powerful Roman cement  so the various parts of the Roman realm were bonded into a massive  monolithic entity by physical  organizational  and psychological controls  The physical bonds included the network of military garrisons  which were stationed in every province  and the network of stone built roads that linked the provinces with Rome  The organizational bonds were based on the common principles of law and administration and on the universal army of officials who enforced common standards of conduct  The psychological controls were built on fear and punishment on the absolute certainty that anyone or anything that threatened the authority of Rome would be utterly destroyed
The source of Roman obsession with unity and cohesion may well have lain in the pattern of Rome s early development  Whereas Greece had grown from scores of scattered cities  Rome grew from one single organism  While the Greek world had expanded along the Mediterranean seas lanes  the Roman world was assembled by territorial conquest  Of course  the contrast is not quite so stark  in Alexander the Great the Greeks had found the greatest territorial conqueror of all time  and the Romans  once they moved outside Italy  did not fail to learn the lessons of sea power  Yet the essential difference is undeniable  The key to the Greek world lay in its high powered ships  the key to Roman power lay in its marching legions  The Greeks were wedded to the sea  the Romans  to the land  The Greek was a sailor at heart  the Roman  a landsman

Certainly  in trying to explain the Roman phenomenon  one would have to place great emphasis on this almost instinct for the territorial imperative  Roman priorities lay in the organization  exploitation  and defense of their territory  In all probability it was the fertile plain of Latium  where the Latins who founded Rome originated  that created the habits and skills of landed settlement  landed property  landed economy  landed administration  and a land based society  From this arose the Roman genius for military organization and orderly government  In turn  a deep attachment to the land  and to the stability which rural life engenders  fostered the Roman virtues  gravitas  a sense of responsibility  pietas  and a sense of devotion to family and country  and iustitia  a sense of the natural order

Modern attitudes to Roman civilization range from the infinitely impressed to the thoroughly disgusted  As always  there are the power worshippers  especially among historians  who are predisposed to admire whatever is strong  who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece  At the same time  there is a solid body of opinion that dislikes Rome  For many  Rome is at best the imitator and the continuator of Greece on a larger scale  Greek civilization had quality  Rome  mere quantity  Greece was original  Rome  derivative  Greece had style  Rome had money  Greece was the inventor  Rome  the research and development division  Such indeed was the opinion of some of the more intellectual Romans   Had the Greeks held novelty in such disdain as we   asked Horace in his epistle   what work of ancient date would now exist

Rome s debt to Greece was enormous  The Romans adopted Greek religion and moral philosophy  In literature  Greek writers were consciously used as models by their Latin successors  It was absolutely accepted that an educated Roman should be fluent in Greek  In speculative philosophy and the sciences  the Romans made virtually no advance on early achievements

Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was somehow a junior partner in Greco Roman civilization  The Roman genius was projected into new spheres especially into those of law  military organization  administration  and engineering  Moreover  the tensions that arose within the Roman state produced literary and artistic sensibilities of the highest order  It was no accident that many leading Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of high caliber
