Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor
Student
Excuse me  Ms  Chambers  Um  I don t have an appointment  but l was kinda wondering if you had a minute to help me with something
Academic advisor
Oh  sure  Have a seat

What s on your mind
Student
Well  uh       I guess I really don t know where to start       It s not just one class  It s       I m not doing all that great  Like on my homework assignments  And in class  And I don t know why  I mean  l just don t get it  l l read the assignments and I do the homework and I m still not doing too well
Academic advisor
Um  which classes  You mean  like Spanish       you re taking Spanish  right
Student
Oh  no  not Spanish       if it weren t for Spanish I d really be in trouble       no  but it s really all the others  psychology and sociology especially
Academic advisor
Is it the material  what you read in the textbooks  You don t understand it
Student
No  that s just it l think I understand stuff when I read it
Academic advisor
You don t re
Student
Remember  Well  I remember names and definitions  but       like  in class  when the professor asks us about the theories  what they re all about  I never have the answer
Academic advisor
Sounds like you re trying to learn by memorizing details  instead of picking out the main points of the reading  So  tall me  how do you study
Student
Well  l l       l mean  I read the assigned chapters  and I try to underline everything       like all of the words I don t know  and I always memorize the definitions  But  I dunno  when I get back in class  it always seems like the other students ve gotten a better handle on what was in the reading  So  maybe it s just me
Academic advisor
Oh  it s not  Believe me  Lots of students       You know  my first year as a college student       I really had a hard time  I spent hours reading in the library      but I was just wasting time   cause I wasn t really studying the right things  I did the same sort of thing it sounds like you re doing  not focusing on what s really important in the reading  but on the smaller details
Student
Yeah  maybe  But I spend so much time studying  it seems like I should be doing better
Academic advisor
The first year of college can be a little overwhelming  I know  Point is  lots of students have trouble adjusting at first  you know  figuring out how to study  how to use their time  you know  to your best advantage  It s good that you do the assigned readings       but  you ve       well  I think you re unnecessarily underlining and memorizing  That takes a lot of time  and  well  it s not the best use of your time  Here s something you can do  when you read  just read the assigned sections  and then       and without
looking back at the text write a summary of the key points  the main ideas in the chapter  And after you do that  it it s good to go back and reread the text  And you look for any examples you can find to support those key points  Let me show you an example of what I mean
