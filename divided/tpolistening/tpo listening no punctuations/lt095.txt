TPO 9 Lecture 3 Geology

Lecturer  So  continuing our discussion of desert lakes  now I want to focus on what s known as the  Empty Quarter   The  Empty Quarter  is a huge area of sand that covers about a quarter of the Arabian Peninsula  Today it s pretty desolate  barren and extremely hot  But there ve been times in the past when monsoon rains soaked the Empty Quarter and turned it from a desert into grassland that was dotted with lakes and home to various animals  There were actually two periods of rain and lake formation  the first one began about 37 000 years ago  and the second one dates from about 10 000 years ago

Female Student  Excuse me  Professor  But I m confused  Why would lakes form in the desert  It s just sand  after all

Lecturer  Good question  We know from modern day desert lakes  like Lake Eyre in South Australia  that under the right conditions  lakes do form in the desert  But the Empty Quarter lakes disappeared thousands of years ago  They left behind their beds or basins as limestone formations that we can still see today  They look like low lying  white or grey buttes  long  narrow hills with flat tops  barely a meter high

A recent study of some of the formations presents some new theories about the area s past  Keep in mind though that this study only looked at 19 formations  And about a thousand have been documented  So there s a lot more work to be done

According to the study  two factors were important for lake formation in the Empty Quarter  first the rains that fell there were torrential  So it would ve been impossible for all the water to soak into the ground  Second  as you know  sand dunes contain other types of particles  besides sand  including clay and silt  Now  when the rain fell  water ran down the sides of the dunes  carrying clay and silt particles with it  And wherever these particles settled  they formed a pan  a layer that water couldn t penetrate  Once this pan formed  further run off collected  and formed a lake

Now  the older lakes  about half the formations  the ones that started forming 37000 years ago  the limestone formations we see  they re up to a kilometer long  but only a few meters wide  and they re scattered along the desert floor  in valleys between the dunes  So  the theory is  the lakes formed there on the desert floor  in these long narrow valleys  And we know  because of what we know about similar ancient desert lakes  we know that the lakes didn t last very long  from a few months to a few years on average  As for the more recent lakes  the ones from 10000 years ago  well  they seemed to have been smaller  and so may have dried up more quickly

Another difference  very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones  is the location of the limestone formations  The more recent beds are high up in the dunes

Why these differences  Well  there are some ideas about that  and they have to do with the shapes of the sand dunes  when the lakes were formed  37000 years ago  the dunes were probably nicely rounded at the top  so the water just ran right down their sides to the desert floor  But there were thousands of years of wind between the two rainy periods  reshaping the dunes  So  during the second rainy period  the dunes were kind of chopped up at the top  full of hollows and ridges  and these hollows would ve captured the rain right there on the top

Now  in a grassland of Lake Ecosystem  we d expect to find fossils from a variety of animals  and numerous fossils have been found at least at these particular sites  But  where did these animals come from  Well  the theory that has been suggested is that they migrated in from nearby habitats where they were already living  Then as the lakes dried up  they died out

The study makes a couple of interesting points about the fossils  which I hope will be looked at in future studies  At older lake sites  there s fossil remains from hippopotamuses  water buffalo  animals that spend much of their lives standing in water  and also  fossils of cattle  However  at the sites of the more recent lakes  there  s only cattle fossils  additional evidence for geologists that these lakes were probably smaller  shallower  because cattle only use water for drinking  So they survive on much less  Interestingly  there are clams and snail shells  but  no fossils of fish  We re not sure why  Maybe there was a problem with the water  Maybe it was too salty  That s certainly true of other desert lakes
