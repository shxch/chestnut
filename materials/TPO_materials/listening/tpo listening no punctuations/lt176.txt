TPO 17 Lecture 4 Biology Octopus

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor
Ok  now I want to talk about an animal that has a fascinating set of defense mechanisms  And that s the octopus  one of the unusual creatures that live in the sea  The octopus is prey to many species  including humans  so how does it escape its predators  Well  let me back up here a second  Anyone ever heard of Proteous  Proteus was a

God in Greek mythology who could change form  He could make himself look like a lion or a stone or a tree  anything you wanted  and he could go through a whole series of changes very quickly  Well  the octopus is the real world version of Proteus  Just like Proteus  the octopus can go through all kinds of incredible transformations  And it does this in three ways  by changing color  by changing its texture  and by changing its size and shape  For me  the most fascinating transformation is when it changes its color  It s a normal skin color  the one it generally presents  is either red or brown or even grey  and it  s speckled with dark spots  But when it wants to blend in with its environment to hide from its enemies  it can take on the color of its immediate surroundings  the ocean floor  a rock  a piece of coral  whatever  Charles

Student
Do we know how that works  I mean  how they change colors

Professor
Well  we know that the reaction that takes place is not chemical in nature  The color changes are executed by two different kinds of cells in the octopus   skin  mainly by color cells on the skin s surface call chromatophores
5

Chromatophores consist of tiny sacks filled with color dye  There might be a couple hundred of these color sacks per square millimeter of the octopus   skin  and depending on the species  they can come in as many as five different colors  Each one of these sacks is controlled by muscles  If the muscles are relaxed  the sack shrinks  and all you see is a little white point  But if the muscle s contract  then the sack expands  and you can see the colors  And by expanding different combinations

Student
And just with various combinations of those five colors  they can recreate any color in their environment
Professor
Well  they can no doubt create a lot with just those five colors  but you are right  maybe they can t mimic every color around them  so that s where the second kind of cell comes in
Just below the chromatophores is a layer of cells that reflect light from the environment  and these cells help the octopus create a precise match with the colors that surround them  The colors from the color sacks are supplemented with colors that are reflected from the environment  and that  s how they are able to mimic colors with such precision  So  that s how octopus mimic colors
But they don t just mimic the colors in their environment  they can also mimic the texture of objects in their environment  They have these little projections on their skin that allow them to resemble various textures  The projections are called
papillae6
  If the octopus wants to have a rough texture  it raises the papillae  If it wants to have a smooth texture  it flattens out the papillae  so it can acquire a smooth texture to blend in with the sandy bottom of the sea  So the octopus has the ability to mimic both the color and the texture of its environment  And it s truly amazing how well it can blend in with its surroundings  You can easily swim within a few feet of an octopus and never see it

Student
I read that they often hide from predators by squirting out a cloud of ink  or
something like that

Professor
Yes  The octopus can release a cloud of ink if it feels threatened  But it doesn t hide behind it  as is generally believed  Um  the ink cloud is     it serves to distract a predator while the octopus makes its escape  Um  now there s a third way that octopus can transform themselves to blend in with or mimic their environment  and that s by changing their shape and size  well  at least their apparent size  The muscular system of the octopus enables it to be very flexible to assume all sorts of shapes and postures  So it can contract into the shape of a little round stone  and sit perfectly still on the seafloor  Or it can nestle up in the middle of a plant and take the shape of one of the leaves  Even Proteus would be impressed  I think
