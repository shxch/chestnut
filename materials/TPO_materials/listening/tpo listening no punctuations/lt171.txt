Conversation 1

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor

Professor
OK  let  s see  Right  Modern Stagings of a Shakespearian Classic  Well  like I told you last week  I think that s a great topic for you paper  So the title would be something like     uh

Student
I am not really sure  probably something like 20th
 century stagings of A Midsummer
Night s Dream

Professor
Yes  I like that  Straightforward and to the point  So how is the research going

Student
Well  that s what I came to talk to you about  I was wondering if you happen to have
a copy of the Peter Brook production of A Midsummer Night s Dream in your video
collection  I ve been looking for it everywhere and I am having a really hard time
tracking it down


Professor
That s because it doesn t exist

Student
You mean in your collection   Or at all

Professor
I mean at all  That particular production was never filmed or recorded

Student
Oh no  I had no idea  From what I read  that production  like  it influenced every other production of the play that came after it  So I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped

Professor
Oh  It definitely was a landmark production  And it s not like it ran for just a week  but either it was never filmed or if it was the film s been lost  And it  s ironic because there s even a film about the making of the production  but none of the production itself

Student
So now what do I do  If there is no video

Professor
Well  think about it  This is the most important 20th century staging of A Midsummer Night s Dream  right

Student
But how can I write about Brook s interpretation of the play if I can t see his
production

Professor
Just because there s no recording doesn t mean you can t figure out how it influenced other productions

Student
Yeah  I guess there s enough material around  but it will be a challenge

Professor
True  But think about it  you are writing about dramatic arts  the theater  and that  s the nature of theater  isn t it

Student
You mean because it is live  when the performance is finished

Professor
That s it  Unless it  s filmed  it s gone  But that doesn t mean we can t study it  And of course some students in this class are writing about productions in the 19th century  there are no videos of those  You know  one of the challenges for people who study theater is to find way of talking about something that  s really so transient  about something that  in a sense  doesn t exist
