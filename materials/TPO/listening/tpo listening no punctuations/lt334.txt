Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor

Student
Professor Landrea
Professor
Hi  Dennis  You are right on time  Come on in and have a seat
Student
Great  Thanks
Professor
So like I told you in class  I just wanted to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations for next week are all in order and coming along well  And as you know  you are supposed to report on some area of recent research in genetics  something…you know…original
Student
Well  I think I found just the thing  It actually occurred to me a couple nights ago while I was eating dinner in the cafeteria  Tell me professor  do you like broccoli
Professor
Broccoli  You mean the vegetable broccoli
Student
Yeah
?
Professor
Well  I guess not really
Student
Me neither  I have never liked it or most other vegetables for that matter…Brussels sprouts  asparagus  cauliflower…you name it  They just taste bitter and…well…nasty to me  My mother always called me a picky eater
Professor
OK…And
Student
And so I got to wondering  I mean  I am obviously not the only person like this  So is this just because of some…like trauma from our childhoods  Some bad experience we ve had with some vegetables  Or could there be some genetic explanation for why some people are picky eaters and others aren t
Professor
OK  I see  Well  I suppose it s a possibility
Student
Actually  it turns out it s more than a possibility  I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently
Professor
Well  I guess that s not too surprising  And this is great stuff actually  So what s the verdict
Student
Well  this guy seems to have discovered a particular gene that actually makes it possible for people to taste the bitterness in certain green vegetables  But people who have a mutation in that gene cannot taste the bitterness
Professor
Well…that s certainly fascinating  But…so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some sort of sensory deficit  Sort of makes us picky eaters than normal ones  doesn t it  I mean  that s kind of turning things on their head  isn t it
Student
Well…then again  it wouldn t be the first time  would it  Think of it this way  humans originally needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be poisonous  But at some point  as people figured out what they could safely eat  this need became less crucial and a segment of the population lost that ability
Professor
OK  Well  you make a compelling case  I can t wait to hear more about this when you deliver your report
