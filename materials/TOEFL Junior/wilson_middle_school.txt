Questions 6-10 refer to the following letter in a school newspaper.
This is my first year attending Wilson Middle School. Last year I went to a different
middle school. Over the summer my father got a new job, so our whole family moved.
Now I go to Wilson.
I want to make some comments based on my unique perspective as someone who has
attended two different middle schools. For example, I was surprised by all the complaints
that the students at Wilson make about the food in the cafeteria. Either they don’t like it,
or they want more choices. But I like the food. The dishes are pretty tasty. And as for
choices, at the school I went to last year there were never more than two lunch options
each day. Sometimes there was only one!
However, I don’t want anyone to think that I have a negative opinion of the Wilson
students. Actually, I have been impressed with how involved the students here are. I plan
to participate in some of the special clubs here that are organized by students, like the
photography club and the hiking club. At my last school, students were not as actively
involved in forming clubs.
