Symbiotic Relationships
A symbiotic relationship is an interaction between two or more species in which one species lives in or on another species  There are three main types of symbiotic relationships  parasitism  commensalism  and mutualism  The first and the third can be key factors in the structure of a biological community  that is  all the populations of organisms living together and potentially interacting in a particular area
Parasitism is a kind of predator prey relationship in which one organism  the parasite  derives its food at the expense of its symbiotic associate  the host  Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts  An example of a parasite is a tapeworm that lives inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs nutrients from its host  Natural selection favors the parasites that are best able to find and feed on hosts  At the same time  defensive abilities of hosts are also selected for  As an example  plants make chemicals toxic to fungal and bacterial parasites  along with ones toxic to predatory animals  sometimes they are the same chemicals   In vertebrates  the immune system provides a multiple defense against internal parasites
At times  it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural selection in host parasite relationships  For example  Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of millions of European rabbits  The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle industries  In 1950  myxoma virus  a parasite that affects rabbits  was deliberately introduced into Australia to control the rabbit population  Spread rapidly by mosquitoes  the virus devastated the rabbit population  The virus was less deadly to the offspring of surviving rabbits  however  and it caused less and less harm over the years  Apparently  genotypes  the genetic make up of an organism  in the rabbit population were selected that were better able to resist the parasite  Meanwhile  the deadliest strains of the virus perished with their hosts as natural selection favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill them  Thus  natural selection stabilized this host parasite relationship
In contrast to parasitism  in commensalism  one partner benefits without significantly affecting the other  Few cases of absolute commensalism probably exist  because it is unlikely that one of the partners will be completely unaffected  Commensal associations sometimes involve one species  obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by another  For instance  several kinds of birds feed on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing cattle  It is difficult to imagine how this could affect the cattle  but the relationship may help or hinder them in some way not yet recognized
The third type of symbiosis  mutualism  benefits both partners in the relationship Legume plants and their nitrogen fixing bacteria  and the interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators  are examples of mutualistic association  In the first case  the plants provide the bacteria with carbohydrates and other organic compounds  and the bacteria have enzymes that act as catalysts that eventually add nitrogen to the soil  enriching it  In the second case  pollinators  insects  birds  obtain food from the flowering plant  and the plant has its pollen distributed and seeds dispersed much more efficiently than they would be if they were carried by the wind only  Another example of mutualism would be the bull s horn acacia tree  which grows in Central and South America  The tree provides a place to live for ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex  The ants live in large  hollow thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree  The ants also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets  these are protein rich and seem to have no   function for the tree except to attract ants  The ants benefit the host tree by attacking virtually anything that touches it  They sting other insects and large herbivores  animals that eat only plants  and even clip surrounding vegetation that grows near the tree  When the ants are removed  the trees usually die  probably because herbivores damage them so much that they are unable to compete with surrounding vegetation for light and growing space
The complex interplay of species in symbiotic relationships highlights an important point about communities  Their structure depends on a web of diverse connections among organisms








1  Which of the following statements about commensalism can be inferred from paragraph 1
 It excludes interactions between more than two species
 It makes it less likely for species within a community to survive
 Its significance to the organization of biological communities is small
 Its role in the structure of biological populations is a disruptive one








2  The word derives in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Digests
 Obtains
 Controls
 Discovers


3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following is true of the action of natural selection on hosts and parasites
 Hosts benefit more from natural selection than parasites do
 Both aggression in predators and defensive capacities in hosts are favored for species survival
 The ability to make toxic chemicals enables a parasite to find and isolate its host
 Larger size equips a parasite to prey on smaller host organisms








4  The word devastated in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Influenced
 Infected
 strengthened
 destroyed

5  Which of the following can be concluded from the discussion in paragraph 3 about the Australian rabbit population
 Human intervention may alter the host  the parasite  and the relationship between them
 The risks of introducing outside organisms into a biological community are not worth the benefits
 Humans should not interfere in host parasite relationships
 Organisms that survive a parasitic attack do so in spite of the natural selection process

6  According to paragraph 3  all of the following characterize the way natural selection stabilized the Australian rabbit population EXCEPT
 The most toxic viruses died with their hosts
 The surviving rabbits were increasingly immune to the virus
 The decline of the mosquito population caused the spread of the virus to decline
 Rabbits with specific genetic make ups were favored

7  The word inadvertently in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Indefensibly
 Substantially
 Unintentionally
 Partially



8  According to paragraph 5  the relationship between legumes and bacteria benefits the soil by
 adding enriching carbohydrates
 speeding the decay of organic matter
 destroying enzymes that pollute it
 contributing nitrogen to it
9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The relationship between flowering plants and pollinators provides pollinators with food and flowers with efficient reproduction
 In some cases birds obtain food from the seeds that are dispersed in the wind
 The wind not only helps the flowers distribute their seeds but enables birds to find more food
 Animals and insects are more effective in distributing pollen and seeds than the wind
10  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is NOT true of the relationship between the bull s horn acacia tree and the Pseudomyrmex ants
 Ants defend the host trees against the predatory actions of insects and animals
 The acacia trees are a valuable source of nutrition for the ants
 The ants enable the acacia tree to produce its own chemical defenses
 The ants protect the acacia from having to compete with surrounding vegetation
11  The word highlights in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Defines
 Emphasizes
 Reflects
 Suggests
12  What is the main purpose of this passage
 To explain the concept of symbiosis by expanded descriptions of its principal types
 To make a comparison between human relationships and symbiotic interactions in the natural world
 To demonstrate the unforeseen benefits of natural processes that at first seem wholly destructive
 To argue that parasitism is a problem that can be solved by scientific intervention



13  Look at the four squares  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
This massive population began a century earlier as a mere twelve pairs of imported rabbits that reproduced quickly and developed into a major problem
Where would the sentence best fit

14   Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Symbiotic relationships involve the interaction of two or more organisms acting as partners





Answer Choices

 Parasitic relationships involve the interplay of aggression by the parasite and resistance and adaptation by the host
 Mutualism ordinarily involves an interaction between two	members of the same species
 Mutualism is unique among symbiotic relationships in that it  r benefits both partners involved in the relationship
 Parasitic damage to Australian rabbits was never reversed because the rabbits were unable to adapt to the parasites  attacks
 The rarity of commensal relationships stems from the difficulty of finding relationships that benefit one species without affecting the other
 The structure of biological communities depends on the types of relationships that exist among the species within
