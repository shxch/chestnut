Colonial Trade

In the late 1400s, the Europeans began sailing around the world. One result was that many countries began to acquire colonies. They were mostly in North and South America, Africa, and Asia. Colonies became vital parts of many European empires. They were often rich in raw materials, which the Europeans desired. A trade system between the colonies and the home countries was set up. The colonies shipped raw materials to Europe. People in Europe made finished products. These products were then shipped back to the colonies. There, they were sold to the colonists.

One example of this kind of trade involved Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The colonies in the Americas had raw materials such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, fish, wood, gold, and silver. England, France, Spain, and Portugal possessed most of the colonies in the Americas. But there was a shortage of manpower. Without workers, they could not get the raw materials they wanted. So they used black African slaves to do the work. Slaves were acquired from Africa. They were then shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The slaves worked to gather or grow raw materials. These were shipped to countries in Europe. Some, including gold, silver, sugar, and tobacco, remained in Europe. Others, such as wood and cotton, were turned into furniture, clothes, and other products. Many of these goods were shipped back across the ocean for the colonists to buy.

A large number of colonists believed that they were being exploited by the Europeans. The colonists wanted to keep the raw materials in their own lands so that they could make finished products of their own. This created ill will between the colonists and Europeans. Resentment between the two began to grow. Later, there were rebellions and independence movements in the colonies. Many colonies thus gained their freedom.
