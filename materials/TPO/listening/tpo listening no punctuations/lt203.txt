I d like to take you back about 11 thousand years ago when Earth entered the latest interglacial period  Interglacial periods are  typically periods of time between Ice Ages  when the climate warms  and the glacial ice retreats for a time  before things cool off again and another Ice Age begins  And for over the past several million years  Earth s sort of default climate has actually been Ice Age  but we have experienced periodic regular thaws  and the last one  the one we are in now  started about 11 thousand years ago

Now  the typical pattern for an interglacial period  and we have studied several  is that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gas actually reaches it    its peak  that is  there is the most carbon dioxide and methane gas  uh  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere just after the beginning of the interglacial period  And then  for reasons which are not entirely clear   the concentration of greenhouse gases gradually goes down  Now  the climate continues to warm for a while because there is a lag effect  But uh  gradually as the concentration of greenhouse gases goes down  Earth starts to cool again  and eventually you slip back into an Ice Age

Um  however   for the latest interglacial period  the one we are in now  this pattern did not hold  that is  the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane dipped1 a little bit after  uh  uh  after peaking at the beginning  near the beginning of the interglacial period  but then it began to rise again  Um     What was different about this interglacial period than the other ones

Well  one of the big differences is human activity  People began to raise crops and animals for food instead of hunting for them  This is the agricultural revolution  And it began to happen in the earliest stages about 11 thousand years ago

Now  scientists have tended to regard     the     uh     agricultural revolution as a beneficiary of the     uh     fortuitous shift in climate  However   some new theories of climate  new theorists of climate have proposed that perhaps humanity was having an effect on the climate as far back as the beginnings of the agricultural revolution  When you grow crops and uh  pasture your animals   one of the things you do is you cut down the forests  If you cut down the forests  when you burn the trees for fuel and don t replace them with other trees  or when you just leave them to rot and don t allow other trees to grow  you end up with a lot more carbon in the form of carbon dioxide getting into the atmosphere

Um     another gas associated with the spread of agriculture is methane  Methane forms in large concentration above wetlands  and as it turns out  the cultivation of certain grains creates vast areas of artificial wetlands  and probably drastically increases the amount of methane getting into the atmosphere  over and above what would be there

So  um    agriculture  the     the spread of agriculture  you know we are talking over thousands of years  um    but this could very well had a profound effect on the composition of Earth s atmosphere  It s kind of ironic to think that absent that effect  it maybe that we would be heading into an Ice Age again  In fact  back in the 1970s  a lot of theorists were predicting that  you know  the climate would start to cool and we d slowly enter into the new Ice Age  And then they were puzzled as to why it didn t seem to be happening

Umm    now  what are the implications for the future  Well  um    it is a little tricky  I mean  you could say  well  here is an example of     um     human activity  the agricultural revolution which actually was beneficial  we altered the climate for the better   perhaps  by preventing an Ice Age  But then industrialization  of course  has drastically increased the amount of carbon dioxide that humans are putting into the atmosphere  the burning of fossil fuels tends to put a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere  Um    so we are entering into uncharted territory now  in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide  the concentrations of carbon dioxide that are now being put into the atmosphere as a result of industrialization and the use of fossil fuels
