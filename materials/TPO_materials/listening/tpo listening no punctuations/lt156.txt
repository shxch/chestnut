TPO 15 Lecture 4 Biology

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor
OK  We ve been talking till now about the two basic needs of a biological
community – an energy source to produce organic materials  you know
uh  food for the organisms  and the waste recycling or breakdown of
materials back into inorganic molecules  and about how all this requires
photosynthesis when green plants or microbes convert sunlight into
energy  and also requires microorganisms  bacteria  to secrete chemicals
that break down or recycle the organic material to complete the cycle

So  now we are done with this chapter of the textbook  we can just
review for the weekly quiz and move on to the next chapter  right  Well
not so fast  First  I  d like to talk about some discoveries that have
challenged one of these fundamental assumptions about what you need
in order to have a biological community

And  well  there actually were quite a few surprises  It all began in 1977 with the exploration of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor  Hydrothermal vents are cracks in the Earth s surface that occur  well  the ones we are taiking about here are found deep at the bottom of the ocean  And these vents on the ocean floor  they release this incredibly hot water  3 to 4 times the temperature that you boil water at  because this water has been heated deep within the Earth

Well about 30 years ago  researchers sent a deep sea vessel to explore the ocean s depth  about 3 kilometers down  way deep to the ocean floor  No one had ever explored that far down before  Nobody expected there to be any life down there because of the conditions

First of all  sunlight doesn t reach that far down so it   s totally dark  There couldn t be any plant or animal life since there s no sunlight  no source of energy to make food  If there was any life at all  it d just be some bacteria breaking down any dead materials that might have fallen to the bottom of the ocean   And

Student 1
And what about the water pressure  Didn t we talk before about how the deeper down into the ocean you go  the greater the pressure

Professor
Excellent point  And not only the extreme pressure  but also the extreme temperature of the water around these vents  If the lack of sunlight didn t rule out the existence of a biological community down there then these factors certainly would  or so they thought

Student 2
So you are telling us they did find organisms that could live under those conditions

Professor
They did indeed  something like 300 different species

Student 1
But    but how could that be  I mean without sunlight  no energy  no no …

Professor
What they discovered was that microorganisms  bacteria  had taken over both functions of the biological community   the recycling of waste materials and the production of energy  They were the energy source  You see  it turns out that certain microorganisms are chemosynthetic   they don t need sunlight because they take their energy from chemical reactions

So  as I said  unlike green plants which are photosynthetic and get their energy from sunlight  these bacteria that they found at the ocean floor  these are chemosynthetic  which means that they get their energy from chemical reactions  How does this work

As we said  these hydrothermal vents are releasing into the ocean depth this intensely hot water and here is the thing  this hot water contains a chemical called hydrogen sulfide  and also a gas   carbon dioxide  Now these bacteria actually combine the hydrogen sulfide with the carbon dioxide and this chemical reaction is what produces organic material which is the food for larger organisms  The researchers had never seen anything like it before

Student 2
Wow  So just add a chemical to a gas  and bingo  you ve got a food supply

Professor
Not just that  W hat was even more surprising were all the large organisms that lived down there  The most distinctive of these was something called the tube worm  Here  let me show you a picture   The tube of the tube worm is really  really long  They can be up to one and a half meters long   and these tubes are attached to the ocean floor  pretty weird looking  huh

And another thing  the tube worm has no mouth or digestive organs  So you are asking how does it eat  Well  they have these special organs that collect the hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and then transfer it to
another organ  where billions of bacteria live  These bacteria that live
inside the tube worms  the tube worms provide them with hydrogen
sulfide and carbon dioxide  And the bacteria  well the bacteria kind of
feed the tube worms through chemosynthesis  remember  that chemical
reaction I described earlier
