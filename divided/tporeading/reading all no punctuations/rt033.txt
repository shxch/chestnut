 
The Long Term Stability of Ecosystems
Plant communities assemble themselves flexibly  and their particular structure depends on the specific history of the area  Ecologists use the term  succession  to refer to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time  The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community  while the long lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community  Pioneer and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years  These changes in plant numbers and the mix of species are cumulative  Climax communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years
An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it relatively unchanged in a year s time  Individual fish may be replaced  but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next  We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem
At one time  ecologists believed that species diversity made ecosystems stable  They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem  Support for this idea came from the observation that long lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than pioneer communities  Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity  To take an extreme example  farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crop  In contrast  a complex climax community  such as a temperate forest  will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pests
The question of ecosystem stability is complicated  however  The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what  stability  means  Stability can be defined as simply lack of change  In that case  the climax community would be considered the most stable  since  by definition  it changes the least over time  Alternatively  stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance  such as a fire  This kind of stability is also called resilience  In that case  climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable  since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state
Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity  At least in temperate zones  maximum diversity is often found in mid successional stages  not in the climax community  Once a redwood forest matures  for example  the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced  In general  diversity  by itself  does not ensure stability  Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability just the opposite  in fact  A more complicated system is  in general  more likely than a simple system to break down  A fifteen speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child s tricycle
Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors contribute to the resilience of communities because climax communities all over the world are being severely damaged or destroyed by human activities  The destruction caused by the volcanic explosion of Mount St  Helens  in the northwestern United States  for example  pales in comparison to the destruction caused by humans  We need to know what aspects of a community are most important to the community s resistance to destruction  as well as its recovery

Many ecologists now think that the relative long term stability of climax communities comes not from diversity but from the  patchiness  of the environment  an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is uniform  A local population that goes extinct is quickly replaced by immigrants from an adjacent community  Even if the new population is of a different species  it can approximately fill the niche vacated by the extinct population and keep the food web intact




1  The word  particular  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 natural
 final
 specific
 complex

2  According to paragraph 1  which of the following is NOT true of climax communities
 They occur at the end of a succession
 They last longer than any other type of community
 The numbers of plants in them and the mix of species do not change
 They remain stable for at least 500 years at a time

3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following principles of ecosystems can be learned by studying a pond
 Ecosystem properties change more slowly than individuals in the system
 The stability of an ecosystem tends to change as individuals are replaced
 Individual organisms are stable from one year to the next
 A change in the members of an organism does not affect an ecosystem s properties



4  According to paragraph 3  ecologists once believed that which of the following illustrated the most stable ecosystems
 Pioneer communities
 Climax communities
 Single crop farmlands
 Successional plant communities



5  According to paragraph 4  why is the question of ecosystem stability complicated
 The reasons for ecosystem change are not always clear
 Ecologists often confuse the word  stability  with the word  resilience
 The exact meaning of the word  stability  is debated by ecologists
 There are many different answers to ecological questions
6  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is true of climax communities
 They are more resilient than pioneer communities
 They can be considered both the most and the least stable communities
 They are stable because they recover quickly after major disturbances
 They are the most resilient communities because they change the least over time


7  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about redwood forests
 They become less stable as they mature
 They support many species when they reach climax
 They are found in temperate zones
 They have reduced diversity during mid successional stages

8  The word  guarantee  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 increase
 ensure
 favor
 complicate


9  In paragraph 5  why does the author provide the information that  A fifteen speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child s tricycle
 To illustrate a general principle about the stability of systems by using an everyday example
 To demonstrate that an understanding of stability in ecosystems can be applied to help understand stability in other situations
 To make a comparison that supports the claim that  in general  stability increases with diversity
 To provide an example that contradicts mathematical models of ecosystems

10  The word  pales  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 increases proportionally
 differs
 loses significance
 is common

11．Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incurred choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Ecologists now think that the stability of an environment is a result of diversity rather than patchiness
 Patchy environments that vary from place to place do not often have high species diversity
 Uniform environments cannot be climax communities because they do not support as many types of organisms as patchy environments
 A patchy environment is thought to increase stability because it is able to support a wide variety of organisms


 12．The word  adjacent  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 foreign
 stable
 fluid
 neighboring



13．Look at the four squares  █  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
In fact  damage to the environment by humans is often much more severe than damage by natural events and processes

14． Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

The process of succession and the stability of a climax community can change over time





Answer choices


 The changes that occur in an ecosystem from the pioneer to the climax community can be seen in one human generation
 A high degree of species diversity does not always result in a stable ecosystem
 The level of resilience in a plant community contributes to its long term stability
 Ecologists agree that climax communities are the most stable types of ecosystems
 Disagreements over the meaning of the term  stability  make it difficult to identify the most stable ecosystems
 The resilience of climax communities makes them resistant to destruction caused by humans
