The surface of Mars
The surface of Mars shows a wide range of geologic features  including huge volcanoes the largest known in the solar system and extensive impact cratering  Three very large volcanoes are found on the Tharsis bulge  an enormous geologic area near Mars s equator  Northwest of Tharsis is the largest volcano of all  Olympus Mons  with a height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700 kilometers in diameter at its base  The three large volcanoes on the Tharsis bulge are a little smaller a  mere 18 kilometers high

None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust there is no plate motion on Mars  Instead  they are shield volcanoes   volcanoes with broad  sloping slides formed by molten rock  All four show distinctive lava channels and other flow features similar to those found on shield volcanoes on Earth  Images of the Martian surface reveal many hundreds of volcanoes  Most of the largest volcanoes are associated with the Tharsis bulge  but many smaller ones are found in the northern plains

The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet s low surface gravity  As lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano  the volcano s eventual height depends on the new mountain s ability to support its own weight  The lower the gravity  the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain  It is no accident that Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height  about 10 kilometers  above their respective bases Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity  Mars s surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth  so volcanoes rise roughly2 5 times as high  Are the Martian shield volcanoes still active  Scientists have no direct evidence for recent or ongoing eruptions  but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago  an estimate of the time of last eruption based on the extent of impact cratering on their slopes   some of them may still be at least intermittently active  Millions of years  though  may pass between eruptions

Another prominent feature of Mars s surface is cratering  The Mariner spacecraft found that the surface of Mars  as well as that of its two moons  is pitted with impact craters formed by meteoroids falling in from space  As on our Moon  the smaller craters are often filled with surface matter mostly dust confirming that Mars is a dry desert world  However  Martian craters get filled in considerably faster than their lunar counterparts  On the Moon  ancient craters less than 100 meters across  corresponding to depths of about 20 meters  have been obliterated  primarily by meteoritic erosion  On Mars  there are relatively few craters less than 5 kilometers in diameter  The Martian atmosphere is an efficient erosive agent  with Martian winds transporting dust from place to place and erasing surface features much faster than meteoritic impacts alone can obliterate them

As on the Moon  the extent of large impact cratering  i e  craters too big to have been filled in by erosion since they were formed  serves as an age indicator for the Martian surface  Age estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars s southern highlands to a few hundred million years in the youngest volcanic areas were obtained in this way

The detailed appearance of Martian impact craters provides an important piece of information about conditions just below the planet s surface  Martian craters are surrounded by ejecta  debris formed as a result of an impact  that looks quite different from its lunar counterparts  A comparison of the Copernicus crater on the Moon with the  fairly typical  crater Yuty on Mars demonstrates the differences  The ejecta surrounding the lunar crater is just what one would expect from an explosion ejecting a large volume of dust  soil  and boulders  However  the ejecta on Mars gives the distinct impression of a liquid that has splashed or flowed out of crater  Geologists think that this fluidized ejecta crater indicates that a layer of permafrost  or water ice  lies just a few meters under the surface  Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice  resulting in the fluid appearance of the ejecta

6   In paragraph 3  why does the author compare Maxwell Mons on Venus to the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth
  To help explain the relationship between surface gravity and volcano height
  To explain why Mars s surface gravity is only 40 percent of Earth s
  To point out differences between the surface gravity of Earth and the surface gravity of Venus
  To argue that there are more similarities than differences between volcanoes on different planets

7  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  Although direct evidence of recent eruptions is lacking  scientists believe that these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago
  Scientists estimate that volcanoes active more recently than 100 years ago will still have extensive impact cratering on their slopes
  If  as some evidence suggests  these volcanoes erupted as recently as 100 million years ago  they may continue to be intermittently active
  Although these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago  there is no direct evidence of recent or ongoing eruptions

  Frequently
  Significantly
  Clearly
  Surprisingly

9  According to paragraph 4  what is demonstrated by the fact that craters fill in much faster on Mars than on the Moon
  Erosion from meteoritic impacts takes place more quickly on Mars than on the Moon
  There is more dust on Mars than on the Moon
  The surface of Mars is a dry desert
  Wind is a powerful eroding force on Mars

10  In paragraph 4  why does the author point out that Mars has few ancient craters that are less than 5 kilometers in diameter
  To explain why scientists believe that the surface matter filling Martian craters is mostly dust
  To explain why scientists believe that the impact craters on Mars were created by meteoroids
  To support the claim that the Martian atmosphere is an efficient erosive agent
  To argue that Mars experienced fewer ancient impacts than the Moon did

11  According to paragraph 5  what have scientists been able to determine from studies of large impact cratering on Mars
  Some Martian volcanoes are much older than was once thought
  The age of Mars s surface can vary from area to area
  Large impact craters are not reliable indicators of age in areas with high volcanic activity
  Some areas of the Martian surface appear to be older than they actually are



12  According to paragraph 6  the ejecta of Mars s crater Yuty differs from the ejecta of the Moon s Copernicus crater in that the ejecta of the Yuty crater
  Has now become part of a permafrost layer
  Contains a large volume of dust  soil and boulders
  Suggests that liquid once came out of the surface at the crater site
  Was thrown a comparatively long distance from the center of the crater

Answer Choices

  Plate motion on Mars  once considered to have played no role in shaping the planet s surface  is now seen as being directly associated with the planet s earliest volcanoes
  Mars has shield volcanoes  some of which are extremely tall because of the planet s low surface gravity
  Although the erosive power of the Martian atmosphere ensures that Mars has fewer craters than the Moon does  impact craters are prominent on Mars s surface
  Scientists cannot yet reliably estimate the age of the Martian surface because there has been too much erosion of it
  Scientists have been surprised to discover that conditions just below the surface of Mars are very similar to conditions just below the surface of the Moon
  Studies of crater ejecta have revealed the possibility of a layer of permafrost below the surface of Mars
