CONVERSATION 1
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of campus activities
Student  I m here  cause    well  there s something I don t understand  I set an announcement for an event  And this morning I checked the events section of the university s website  And nothing  there is no mention of it
Director  And when did you summit this request
Student  Last Wednesday  I followed the instructions very carefully  I am sure it was Wednesday  because know announcements have be submitted three business days ahead of the posting day
Director  And what s it for
Student  A reading
Director  A reading
Student  Yes  A poetry reading
Director  Oh  OK  When is it
Student  In three days  It is an author from France we have been trying to get for a while  And now that he has finally agreed to come  no one will be there
Director  Wow  This person is really coming all the way from France
Student  Oh  no  He is teaching promising there will be in New York City this year  We were able to sell him on a nice size crowd   felt confident about that  Because the idea by I know how enthusiastic our group is
Director  And your group   do you have a name
Student  Um   it is kind of a loose group  you know  just a bunch of students in the French department who are interested in French literature  There s no formal structure or anything  I guess you could call us the French Literature Reading Group
Director  OK  And it is a recognized group  By the university  I mean
Student  No
Director  OK
Student  But the French Department is funding this  on the condition that we do all the legwork
Director  All right  Hold on a second while I check  Well  it looks like we did receive your announcement last Wednesday  Uh  looks like the editors must have decided not to include your event in this week s listings
Student  Not included  Why
Director  Well  we don t post things automatically  We get so many requests that we couldn t possibly post them all  So events that are thought to be too specialized  without the potential for really wide appeal
Student  Wow  I got to say that does surprise me  What am I going to do now  I mean  he really is quite famous  I really do think there would be a genuine interest beyond my group  It would be a shame if no one shows up because there isn t enough publicity  Is there anyone else I can talk to
Director  I don t think that would do you much good since we are already working on next week s schedule  But maybe you could ask the French department to post the announcement on its website  And maybe you could approach some other departments as well  you know  relevant ones
Student  I knew we should have done a poster  But everybody was like  oh  you can just post it online  In any event  thanks for you help  It s something to consider
