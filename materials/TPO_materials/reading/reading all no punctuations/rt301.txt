Role of Play in Development
Play is easier to define with examples than with concepts  In any case  in animals it consists of leaping  running  climbing  throwing  wrestling  and other movements  either along  with objects  or with other animals  Depending on the species  play may be primarily for social interaction  exercise  or exploration  One of the problems in providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstance  dominance  predation  competition  and real fighting  Thus  whether play occurs or not depends on the intention of the animals  and the intentions are not always clear from behaviors alone
Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems  mainly birds and mammals  Play has been studied most extensively in primates and canids  dogs   Exactly why animals play is still a matter debated in the research literature  and the reasons may not be the same for every species that plays  Determining the functions of play is difficult because the functions may be long term  with beneficial effects not showing up until the animal s adulthood
Play is not without considerable costs to the individual animal  Play is usually very active  involving movement in space and  at times  noisemaking  Therefore  it results in the loss of fuel or energy that might better be used for growth or for building up fat stores in a young animal  Another potential cost of this activity is greater exposure to predators since play is attention getting behavior  Great activities also increase the risk of injury in slipping or falling
The benefits of play must outweigh costs  or play would not have evolved  according to Darwin s theory  Some of the potential benefits relate directly to the healthy development of the brain and nervous system  In one research study  two groups of young rats were raised under different conditions  One group developed in an  enriched  environment  which allowed the rats to interact with other rats  play with toys  and receive maze training  The other group lived in an  impoverished  environment in individual cages in a dimly lit room with little stimulation  At the end of the experiments  the results showed that the actual weight of the brains of the impoverished rats was less than that of those raised in the enriched environment  though they were fed the same diets   Other studies have shown that greater stimulation not only affects the size of the brain but also increase the number of connections between the nerve cells  Thus  active play may provide necessary stimulation to the growth of synaptic connections in the brain  especially the cerebellum  which is responsible for motor functioning and movements
Play also stimulates the development of the muscle tissues themselves and may provide the opportunities to practice those movements needed for survival  Prey species  like young deer or goats  for example  typically play by performing sudden flight movements and turns  whereas predator species  such as cats  practice stalking  pouncing  and biting
Play allows a young animal to explore its environment and practice skill in comparative safety since the surrounding adults generally do not expect the young to deal with threats or predators  Play can also provide practice in social behaviors needed for courtship and mating  Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially important for species that live in groups  like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and aggression and to understand the give and take involved in social groups  They need to learn how to be dominant and submissive because each monkey might have to play either role in the future  Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have  during which they engage in countless play experiences with their peers
There is a danger  of course  that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others  potentially leading to aggression  This is especially true when play consists of practicing normal aggressive or predator behaviors  Thus  many species have evolved clear signals to delineate playfulness  Dogs  for example  will wag their tails  get down their front legs  and stick their behinds in the air to indicate  what follows is just for play



1  According to paragraph 1  why is play difficult to define
  Play must be defined with concepts  not examples
  Play behavior often looks like nonplay behavior
  Play often occurs in the presence of animals that are not playing
  Play occurs independently of an animal s intentions







2  According to paragraph 2  which of the following presents a particular challenge to researchers who study play behavior in animals
  The delay between activities and the benefits the animal derives from them
  The difficulty in determining which animal species play and which do not
  The fact that for most animals  there is no clear transition from youth to full adulthood
  The lack of research on the play behavior of animals other than canids and primates
3  The word  considerable  in the passage is closest in the meaning to
  Initial
  Practical
  Eventually
  Significant
4  According to paragraph 3  each of the following is a cost to animals that engage in play EXCEPT
  exposure to predators
  a buildup of fat stores
  a loss of fuel that could be used for growth
  risk of injury from slipping or falling







5  Why does the author include the comment  though they were fed the same diets
  To show why rats living in impoverished environments need less food than those living in enriched environments
  To eliminate the possibility that differences in diet were responsibly for observed differences in brain weight
  To emphasize the point that rats were fed only the amount of food needed to keep them alive
  To suggest that rats fed the same diet have smaller brains than those fed a varied food


6  Paragraph 4 supports which of the following statements about an animal s brain
  The heavier the brain  the richer the environment in which the animal was raised
  The younger the animal  the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells
  The larger the animal  the harder it is to develop new connections between nerve cells
  The larger the animal s cerebellum  the larger will be the animal s nerve cells


7  According to paragraph 5  why might play behavior of prey species be different from those of predator species
  Unlike predator species  prey species use play to prevent inappropriate social behaviors  such as biting
  Some prey species are physically incapable of certain types of predator movements
  The survival of each species type is linked to particular sets of muscular movements
  Predator species have more opportunities to practice play behaviors than prey species












8  The word  comparative  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  relative
  temporary
  sufficient
  complete



9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  Only monkeys that have learned to control their selfish and aggressive behaviors can be involved in social groups
  Selfish and aggressive animals like monkeys live in groups in order to practice appropriate social behaviors
  Monkeys and other social animals need to learn behaviors appropriate for their social groups
  Some monkeys are naturally too selfish and aggressive to understand the give and take of social groups  so they learn such important behaviors while young



10  What can be inferred from paragraph 6 about the role of adults in play activities of the young
  Adults help their young learn to become dominant within the social group
  Young animals learn how to play from the adults within their social group
  Adults allow the young to engage in play behaviors within a protected  sage environment
  The long developmental period of some animals allows adults more time to teach their young how to deal with the threats of predators










11  The word  potentially  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  undoubtedly
  possibly
  unfortunately
  quickly
12  According to paragraph 7  how do some animals ensure that other animals understand that they are just playing
  By playing only with animals who are not predator
  By avoiding any aspects of the play behavior that are dangerous
  By practicing nonaggressive and non predatory behaviors
  By using a set of signals that occurs only in play
13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence can be added to the passage
With messages such as those  even dogs that are strangers to each other can be playing within a few minutes
Where would the sentence best fit
14  Directions an introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary be selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points



Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems  mainly birds and mammals




Answer Choices

  Although play often resembles aggression  flight  or other purposeful activities  researchers do not agree on the reasons for and functions of play
  Although many animals develop physically from play  too many young animals become victims of their natural predators while playing
  Animals such as rats  dogs  deer  goats and monkeys learn how to be both dominant and submissive during play activities so that they will fit in better with their adult social groups
  The function of play is still debated in the research literature primarily because each animal species uses so few of the many available types of play behavior
  Energy expenditure and security risks are some of the costs to animals of play behavior  but the costs are not so great that they outweigh the long term benefits of play to the species
  As experiments and observations have shown  animals that play at some stages of their development obtain neurological  muscular  or social benefits from the play behaviors
