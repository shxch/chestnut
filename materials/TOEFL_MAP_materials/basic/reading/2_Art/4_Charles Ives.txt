Charles Ives

Charles Ives was a great American composer. He wrote more than 100 pieces of music. Sadly, his work was largely unknown during his lifetime. Ives was born in 1874 and died in 1954. His father was a band leader and taught his son about music. Ives never made a living from his music. Instead, he entered the insurance business, which was quite profitable for him. In his spare time, he composed music at home. In the 1930s, he abruptly stopped writing music. He felt that there was no more that he could do.

Most of Ives's music was original. His sources were music he heard in churches and town squares that he combined with classical European styles. Ives used complex arrangements in his compositions. This made them difficult for musicians to play. That was one reason why he was fairly unknown during his life. Another reason is that he was never fully satisfied with music. So he often changed the pieces. This has made it hard to date each of his musical works. Ives rarely performed in public. Nor did he like the radio or recorded music. He did, however, record some of his works before his death. This helped preserve his legacy.

In the last few years of his life, Ives started to gain popularity. Several famous conductors led orchestras that played his music at live concerts or on the radio. After he died, his fame increased even more. By the end of the 1900s, he was regarded as an original composer. His works have influenced a number of modern forms of music. Today, Charles Ives is recognized around the world as one of the greatest American composers.
