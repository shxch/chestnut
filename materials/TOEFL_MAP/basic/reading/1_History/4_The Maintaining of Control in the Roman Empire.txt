The Maintaining of Control in the Roman Empire 

Almost from its founding, Rome began to expand. At its greatest point, the Roman Empire was enormous. It controlled land in most of Europe and parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Millions of people lived within its borders. Yet most of them had been conquered in battle. So the emperors often worried about their to Rome. To keep these people from rebelling, the Romans used two primary methods. 

First, they stationed troops all over the empire. The number of soldiers in a region depended on its danger level. The Roman Empire was divided into three main areas. First was the homeland on the Italian peninsula. This area was the most secure. Thus the least number of troops were there. Second were the senatorial provinces such as Spain. They had long been a part of Rome. The people were used to Roman rule. They rarely caused problems. So, few soldiers were in those areas, too. The third region included the imperial provinces. These were on the empire's borders. The emperor directly ruled them. Many soldiers, known as legionaries, were posted in the imperial provinces in units called legions. A single legion could control a large area. Some legions were in Britain. Others were along the Rhine and Danube rivers and in the Middle East. They controlled the local populace.

But the Romans did not rely only on force to maintain unity. They also offered citizenship to people in the provinces. This gave people many rights and privileges. At first, local leaders were made citizens. Over time, others became citizens, too. This helped the people feel that they were Romans. This system proved to be effective. The Pax Romana, or "Roman Peace," was a result of these policies. For decades, Rome was united and suffered few internal problems.
