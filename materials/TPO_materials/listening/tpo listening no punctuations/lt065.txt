Alright everybody  the topic for today is  well  we re gonna take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you re writing  One way of doing that is to come up with what s called  a character sketch   I don t mean a sketch like a drawing  I guess that s obvious  It s um…it s a…a sketch is a way of getting started on defining your characters  personalities

To begin  how do we create fictional characters  We don t just pull them from thin air  do we  I mean we don t create them out of nothing  We base them  consciously or unconsciously  we base them on real people  or we blend several people s traits  their attributes into one character  But when people think fiction  they may assume the characters come from the author s imagination  But the writer s imagination is influenced by… by real people  could be anyone  so  pay attention to the people you meet  someone in class  at the gym  that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house  um… your cousin  who s always getting into dangerous situations  We re pulling from reality  gathering bits and pieces of real people  You use these people  and the bits of behavior or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to sketch out your characters

Here is what you should think about doing first  When you begin to formulate a story  make a list of interesting people you know or have observed  Consider why they re unique or annoying  Then make notes about their unusual or dominant attributes  As you create fictional characters  you ll almost always combine characteristics from several different people on your list to form the identity and personality of just one character  Keeping this kind of character sketch can help you solidify your character s personality  so that it remains consistent throughout your story

You need to define your characters  know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are predictable  consistent with their personalities  Get to know them like a friend  you know your friends well enough to know how they ll act in certain situations  right  Say you have three friends  their car runs out of gas on the highway  John gets upset  Mary remains calm  Teresa takes charge of handling the situation  And let s say  both John and Mary defer to her leadership  They call you to explain what happen  And when John tells you he got mad  you re not surprised  because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong  Then he tells you how Teresa took charge  calmed him down  assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way  Again  you re not surprised  It s exactly what you d expect  Well  you need to know your characters  like you know your friends  If you know a lot about a person s character  it s easy to predict how they ll behave  So if your characters  personalities are well defined  it will be easy for you as the writer to portray them realistically…er… believably  in any given situation

While writing character sketches  do think about details  Ask yourself questions  even if you don t use the details in your story  um…what does each character like to eat  what setting does each prefer  the mountains  the city  what about educational background  their reactions to success or defeat  write it all down

But  here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall  Don t make your character into a stereotype  Remember the reader needs to know how your character is different from other people who might fall in the same category  Maybe your character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years  To make sure he is not a stereotype  ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting  Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the  ragged mountain dweller

Okay  now  I ll throw out a little terminology  It s easy stuff  Major characters are sometimes called  round characters   Minor characters are sometimes called  well  just the opposite   flat   A round character is fully developed  a flat character isn t  character development is fairly limited  The flat character tends to serve mainly as a motivating factor  For instance  you introduce a flat character who has experienced some sort of defeat  And then your round  your main character who loves success and loves to show off  comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the flat character s defeat in front of others  humiliates the other guy  The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to show off
