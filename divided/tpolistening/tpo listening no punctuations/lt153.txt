As geologists  we examine layers of sediment on the Earth  s surface to approximate the dates of past geologic time periods  Uh    sediment as you know  is material like sand   gravel  fossil fragments that is transported by natural processes like wind   water flow or the movement of glaciers  So sediment is transported and then deposited and it forms layers on the Earth s surface over time  We examine these layers to learn about different geologic time periods including when they began and ended

For example  from about 1 8 million years ago to around 11 thousand years ago was the Pleistocene Epoch  The Pleistocene Epoch was an ice age  During this Epoch  sediment was made by the kind of erosion and weathering that happens when the climate is colder  and part of those sediments are fossils of plants and animals that lived at that time

The Holocene Epoch followed the Pleistocene Epoch when the Earth   s climate warmed up around 11 thousand years ago  The Holocene Epoch is characterized by different sediments  ones that form when the climate is warmer  Because the climate changed  the types of plants and animals changed also  Holocene sediments contain remnants of more recent plants and animals  so it s pretty easy to differentiate geologically between these two Epochs

Now there is growing evidence that the presence of humans has altered the Earth so much that a new Epochc of geologic history has begun â€“ the Anthropocene Epoch  a new human influenced Epoch  This idea that we ve entered a new Anthropocene Epoch was first proposed in 2002  The idea is that around the year 1800 CE the human population became large enough  around a billion people  that its activities started altering the environment

This was also the time of the industrial revolution  which brought a tremendous increase in the use of fossil fuels such as coal  The exploitation of fossil fuels has brought planet wide developments  industrialization  construction  uh  mass transport  And these developments have caused major changes like additional erosion of the Earth s surface and deforestation  Also  things like the damming of rivers   has caused increased sediment production  not to mention the addition of more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere  Naturally all these changes show up in recent sediments  And these sediments are quite different from pre year 1800 sediment layers

Interestingly there s some speculation that humans started having a major impact on Earth much earlier  about 8000 years ago  That s when agriculture was becoming widespread  Early farmers started clearing forests and livestock produced a lot of extra methane  But I want to stress this is just a hypothesis  The idea that early humans could have had such a major effect  well I m just not sure we can compare it with the industrial age

Geologists in the far future will be able to examine the sediment being laid down today  whereas right now we can say that yes  human impact on the Earth is clear  It ll be future researchers who have a better perspective and will be able to really draw a line between the Holocene and the Anthropocene Epochs
