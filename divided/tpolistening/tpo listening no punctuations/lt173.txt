Ok  so we have been talking about theories that deal with the effects of human activity on the climate  But today I d like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in climate  And one of the best known is called the Milankovitch Hypothesis

Now what the Milankovitch Hypothesis is about  It says that variations in earth s movements  specifically in its orbit around the sun  these variations lead to differences in the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth  And it is these differences in the amount of energy that s reaching earth from the sun  it is what causes variations in earth s climate

Ok  a lot of people think of earth s orbit around the sun as being perfectly circular  as smooth and as regular as  say  the way that hands move on a well  made watch  but it just doesn t work that way  You are probably aware that the earth s orbit around the sun  it is not shaped like a perfect circle  It is more of an oval  it is elliptical  But the shape of this orbit isn t consistent  it varies over time  over a period of about a thousand years  Sometimes it is a little more circular  sometimes it is more elliptical  And when earth s orbit is more elliptical  earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year  Which makes earth  and in particular  the northern hemisphere  warmer  And why is that important  well  because most of the planet s glaciers are in the northern hemisphere  and if it gets too warm  then glaciers will stop forming  And we ve already talked about how that affects earth s overall temperature

The second movement involved in the hypothesis has to do with axial tilt  The tilt of earth s axis  that imaginery pole that runs through the center of the earth  And depending on the angle it tilts at  the seasons can be more or less severe  It makes winters cooler and summers warmer  or what some might say it is doing now  it makes summers less hot  and more importantly  the winters less cold  Which just like what I mentioned before  can also stop  prevent glaciers from forming  or cause them to melt

There is a third movement the hypothesis covers called precession  Precession  basically is the change in the direction of earth s axis of rotation  It will take me a million years to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession is quite complex  And all these details are way beyond our scope  What s important for you to understand is that these three movements  well  they are cyclical  and they work together to form  to produce complex but regular variations in earth s climate  and lead to the growth or decline of glaciers

Now  when Milankovitch first proposed this theory in the 1920s  many of his colleagues were skeptical  Milankovitch didn t have any proof  Actually there wouldn t be any evidence to support his hypothesis until the 1970s  when oceanographers were able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect samples  samples which were then analyzed by geologists  And from these samples they were able to put together a history of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years  and this showed that earth s climate had changed pretty much the way Milankovitch s hypothesis suggested it would  So this evidence was pretty strong support for the Milankovitch Hypothesis  And by the 1980s  most people accepted this theory

However  in the late 1980s  some scientists were exploring Devil  s Hole  which is basically an extensive water filled cave  far from the ocean  in Nevada2
  in the
western United States  Over millions of years  groundwater left deposits of a mineral
called calcite3
  on the rock within Devil s Hole  And by studying these calcite deposits
we can determine the climate conditions  the temperatures over the last half million
years  Well  the Devil  s Hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the
1970s  so basically the question was  were the ages of one or both the samples were
wrong  or were scientists misunderstanding the significance of the evidence

Well  in the 1990s  a new study was done on the two samples  And the ocean floor
samples were found to be correct  as were the samples from Devil s Hole  And now it
is generally believed that the sample from Devil s Hole correspond to variations in
local climate  in the western United States  rather than global climate changes
