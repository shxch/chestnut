TPO23 Lecture4 Choreography  Screen Dance
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a choreography class
Professor  Now  when you think about choreography  well  uh  for your last assignment  you choreographed the dance that was performed on stage in front of live audience  Now  screen dance is very different  It is a dance routine you will be choreographing specifically to be viewed on a screen  on a computer screen  a TV screen  in a movie theater  any screen  So the question we have to ask is  what s the difference between choreography for a live performance and choreography for on screen viewing
OK  Think for a minute  When you see a movie  is it just a film of people acting on a stage  Of course not  Movies use a variety of camera angles and creative editing  Movies can distort time  slow movement down  or speed it up  show actors fading in and out of scenes  etc  All of these   all of these film making techniques  things that can t be used in a live performance  are possible in a screen dance  Now  we ll cover these concepts in greater detail later  but you should be getting the idea that I don t want you to just film dancers on stage and turn it in as your screen dance project  Uh  Yes  Debbie
Student  But isn t something lost here  Professor Watson  I am a dancer  and when I perform on stage  I am so energized by the audience s reactions  the applause  I actually  and for a lot of dancers  it   it really inspires us
Professor  You re right  Screen dance  which is a relatively new  isn t for everyone  Uh  some dancers may seem reluctant to participate in your project  because they do thrive on the immediacy of performing live  If this happens  you could point out that screen dance offers other ways for dancers to connect to their audience  For example  dancers can express themselves  even change the whole mood of the scene through a facial expression  And you could film close up shots of their faces  Facial expressions aren t as important in live performances generally  because the choreographer knows that someone in the back row of a theater may not be able to see a dancer s face clearly
Student  But   um  I have never used a movie camera or edited film before  How will we learn everything we need to know to
Professor  Oh  don t worry  The cameras you will be using are pretty simple to operate  And you ll get to play with the film editing software several times before beginning your project  You ll also have the option of working with a student in the film department  someone who s familiar with the technology  But the choreography and the end result will be your responsibility of course
Student  Could you talk some more about the film   making techniques  you know  the ones that work best forscreen dances
Professor  I ll show some of my favorite screen dances next week to give you a better idea  But  uh  OK  Here s one technique that can create the illusion of flow in a screen dance  You film the same dancer  entering and exiting the frame several times  Moving slowly at first  then faster and faster  Then in the editing room  you can digitally manipulate these images  like you might put five or ten or twenty copies of that same dancer meeting himself in the middle of the screen  to make it look like he is dancing with himself
Obviously  this can t be done in a live performance  Another example  in one screen dance I saw  the dancers leap through sheets of fire in a big abandoned building  Of course  the building wasn t really on fire  A technique called super imposing was used  The dancers were filmed and layered in the editing room  The fire was added to the background
Student  That sounds awesome  But if anyone can watch a dance on a computer screen  Why would they pay to go see a live performance  What if screen dance got so popular that it replaced live dance
Professor  Screen dance is an entirely different type of presentation  It could never replicate the immediacy  the kind of drama that live performance offers  There will be an audience for that  I think what screen dance will do  though  is heighten awareness of dance in general  Because it is a way   u h  it can reach people in their homes  in their workplaces  at anytime really  And if someone discovers that they love dance by watching a screen dance  there s a good chance they will get interested enough to buy a ticket to see a live performance
