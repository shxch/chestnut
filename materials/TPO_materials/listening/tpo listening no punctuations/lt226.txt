TPO22 Lecture 4  Music History
?Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class
Professor  So  uh  if you are a musician in the United States in the early twentieth century  where could you work
Student  Same as now  I suppose  In an orchestra  mainly
Professor  Ok  And where would the orchestra be playing
Student  Uh  in a concert hall or a dance hall
Professor  That s right  And smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to visual entertainment  like cabarets and variety shows  But the largest employer for musicians back then was the film industry  especially during the silent film era
Student  Really  You mean being a piano player or something  I thought movie theaters would have used recorded music
Professor  Well  no  Not during the silent film era  We are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in movie theaters was the best job for musicians  It was very well paid  The rapid growth of the film industry meant movie theaters were popping up everywhere  So suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians  In fact  over 20 000 jobs for musicians were gone  disappeared at the end of the silent film era  20 000  Ok  So from the beginning  music was a big part of film  even at the firstâ€¦
Student  Excuse me  professor  I think I read somewhere that they used music to drown out the sound of the film projectors
Professor  Yeah  That s good story  isn t it  Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only reason music was used  Well  think about it  Even if that were the case  noisy projectors were separated from the main house pretty quickly  yet music continued to accompany film  So  as I was saying  even the very first public projection of a film had piano accompaniment  So music was pretty much always there
What s strange to me though  is that at first film music didn t necessarily correspond to what was on the screen  You know  eh  a fast number for a chase  deep bass notes for danger  something light and humorous for comedy  And that s instantly recognizable now  even expected  But in the very early days of film  any music was played  A theater owner would just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it  no matter what it was  Pretty quickly though  thankfully  everybody realized the music should suit the film  So eventually  film makers tried to get more control over the musical accompaniment of their films   and specify what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it
Student  Are you saying there was no music written specifically for a particular movie
Professor  Yeah  Original scores weren t common then  Rarely a filmmaker might send along an original score composed especially for a film  but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used  Yeah  that was a good time for a lot of musicians  But that all changed with the introduction of sound on film technology  Actually  even before that  organs could mimic a number of instruments and also do some sound effects  So they were starting to replace live orchestras in some movie theaters  and it only takes one person to play an organ
Student  Ok  But even after that someone still had to play the music for the sound for the sound recordings  the soundtracks
Professor  Yeah  But think of all the movie theaters there were  most employing about six to eight musicians  some even had full orchestras  But in the early 1930s  most theater owners installed new sound systems  So suddenly a lot of musicians were looking for work  Once recording technology took off  studio jobs working exclusively for one film company  eh  studio jobs did become available  But the thing is  each major movie company pretty much had only one orchestra for all their productions  a set number of regular musicians  So if you could get it  studio musician was a good job  If you were cut out for it  musicians had to be able to read music very well  since the producers were very conscious of how much money they were spending  They didn t want to waste any time  So a musician was expected to play complicated pieces of music pretty much without any preparation  If one couldn t do it  there were plenty of others waiting to try  So there was a lot of pressure to do well
