Okay  I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab assignment that s coming out so     I m gonna take a little time this morning to discuss it  So  you know the assignment has to do with Spectroscopy  right  And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that s all about  But  let s talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics

What is Spectroscopy  Well  the simplest definition I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and light  Now  visible light consists of different colors or wavelengths  which together make up what s called spectrum  a band of colors  like you see in a rainbow  And all substances  all forms of matter  can be distinguished according to what wavelength of light they absorb and which ones they reflect  It s like  um  well  every element has  what we call  its own spectral signature  If we can read that signature  we can identify the element  And that s exactly what spectroscopy does

Now  Laser Spectroscopy  which is the focus of your assignment  works by measuring very precisely what parts of the spectrum are absorbed by different substances  And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines  And your assignment will be to choose a discipline that interests you  and devise an experiment

For example  I m gonna talk about art  I m interested in the art and to me it s interesting how spectroscopy is used to analyze art  Let s say a museum curator comes to you with a problem  She s come across this painting that appears to be an original   let s say  a Rembrandt  And she wants to acquire it for her museum  But she s got a problem  she s not absolutely certain it s an original  So  what do you do  How do you determine whether the painting s authentic

Okay  Think about the scientific process  You ve got the question  Is the painting a Rembrandt  So first  you ll need to make a list of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt  Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics

So first of all  you ll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas   his brushstrokes  how thickly he applied his paint  So you d need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt s style  You d have to know when he created his paintings  um    what pigments he used  in other words  what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint   cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes  finishes  what have you  have changed over time

Since you re trying to verify if it s a Rembrandt  the ingredients in the pigment would need to have been used during Rembrandt s lifetime   in the 17th century  And that s where chemistry comes in  You ve got to find out what s in those pigments  learn their composition  and that requires lab work   detective work really   in a word  Spectroscopy  So  how do we use Spectroscopy

Well  we put an infrared microscope   a spectroscope   on tiny tiny bits of paint  And using ultraviolet light we can see the spectral signature of each component part of the pigment  Then we compare these signatures with those of particular elements like zinc or lead  to determine what the pigment was made of  So  you can see why this type of analysis requires a knowledge of the history of pigments  right  How and when they were made  Say we determined a pigment was made with zinc  for example  We know the spectral signature of zinc  And it matches that of the paint sample  We also know that zinc wasn t discovered until the 18th century  And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th century  we know he couldn t have painted it

Now  Spectroscopy has a very distinct advantage over previous methods of analyzing our works  because it s not invasive  You don t have to remove big chips of paint to do your analysis  which is what other methods require  All you do is train the microscope on tiny flecks of paint and analyze them

Now a word or two about restoration  Sometimes original art works appear questionable or inauthentic because they ve had so many restorers add touch up layers to cover up damage  damage from the paint having deteriorated over time  Well  spectroscopy can reveal the composition of those touch up layers too  So we can find out when they were applied  Then if we want to undo some bad restoration attempts  we can determine what kind of process we can use to remove them to dissolve the paint and uncover the original
