Professor
All right  so let me close today s class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight s assignment  You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson s best known essays  Self Reliance  and comparing it with his poems and other works

I think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about things like truth and where your lives are going   all sorts of profound questions

Knowing something about Emerson s philosophies will help you when you read  Self Reliance   And basically  one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth  Not that it s something that we can be taught  Emerson says it s found within ourselves  So this truth  the idea that it s in each one of us  is one of the first points that you ll see Emerson making in this essay  It s a bit abstract but he s very into…uh… into each person believing his or her own thought  believing in yourself  the thought or conviction that s true for you

But actually  he ties that in with a sort of  universal truth  – something that everyone knows but doesn t realize they know  Most of us are in touch with ourselves in a way  so we just aren t capable of recognizing profound truth  It takes geniuses  people like  say  Shakespeare  who re unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth  this universal truth  they pay attention to it and express it and don t just dismiss it like most people do

So Emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself  You ll see that he writes about  well  first  conformity  He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of conformity and consistency  They try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it s at odds with their beliefs and their identities  Therefore  it s best to be a non conformist – to do your own thing  not worrying about what other people think  That s an important point  He really drives this argument home throughout the essay

When you are reading  I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of his time  Remember this is 1838  Self Reliance  was a novel idea at the time and the United States citizens were less secure about themselves as individuals and as Americans  The country as a whole was trying to define itself  Emerson wanted to give people something to really think about  help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were  So that s something that I think is definitely as relevant today as it was then  probably  um  especially among young adults like yourselves  you know  uh  college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you re going

Now  we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non conformity  right  As a way to sort of not lose your own self and identity in the world  to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it

Well  he takes this a step further  Not conforming also means  uh  not conforming with yourself or your past  What does that mean  Well  if you ve always been a certain way or done a certain thing  but it s not working for you any more  or you re not content  Emerson says that it d be foolish to be consistent even with our own past  Focus on the future   he says   That s what matters more  Inconsistency is good

He talks about a ship s voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay   how the best voyage is made up of zigzag lines  Up close  it seems a little all over the place  but from farther away  the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way  So  don t worry if you are not sure where you re headed or what your long term goals are  Stay true to yourself and it ll make sense in the end  I mean  I can attest to that  Before I was a literature professor  I was an accountant  Before that  I was a newspaper reporter  My life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here I am  very happy with my experiences and where they ve brought me  If you rely on yourself and trust your own talents  your own interest  don t worry  your path will make sense in the end
