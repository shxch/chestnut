The Pace of Evolutionary Change
A heated debate has enlivened recent studies of evolution  Darwin s original thesis  and the viewpoint supported by evolutionary gradualists  is that species change continuously but slowly and in small increments  Such changes are all but invisible over the short time scale of modern observations  and  it is argued  they are usually obscured by innumerable gaps in the imperfect fossil record  Gradualism  with its stress on the slow pace of change  is a comforting position  repeated over and over again in generations of textbooks  By the early twentieth century  the question about the rate of evolution had been answered in favor of gradualism to most biologists  satisfaction
Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new evidence or new arguments based on old evidence come to light  In 1972 paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged conventional wisdom with an opposing viewpoint  the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis  which posits that species give rise to new species in relatively sudden bursts  without a lengthy transition period  These episodes of rapid evolution are separated by relatively long static spans during which a species may hardly change at all
The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis attempts to explain a curious feature of the fossil record     one that has been familiar to paleontologist for more than a century but has usually been ignored  Many species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil record for millions of years     a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin s model of continuous change  Intermediated fossil forms  predicted by gradualism  are typically lacking  In most localities a given species of clam or coral persists essentially unchanged throughout a thick formation of rock  only to be replaced suddenly by a new and different species
The evolution of North American horse  which was once presented as a classic textbook example of gradual evolution  is now providing equally compelling evidence for punctuated equilibrium  A convincing 50 million year sequence of modern horse ancestors     each slightly larger  with more complex teeth  a longer face  and a more prominent central toe    seemed to provide strong support for Darwin s contention that species evolve gradually  But close examination of those fossil deposits now reveals a somewhat different story  Horses evolved in discrete steps  each of which persisted almost unchanged for millions of years and was eventually replaced by a distinctive newer model  The four toed Eohippus preceded the three toed Miohippus  for example  but North American fossil evidence suggests a jerky  uneven transition between the two  If evolution had been a continuous  gradual process  one might expect that almost every fossil specimen would be slightly different from every year
If it seems difficult to conceive how major changes could occur rapidly  consider this  an alteration of a single gene in files is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings
The question about the rate of evolution must now be turned around  does evolution ever proceed gradually  or does it always occur in short bursts  Detailed field studies of thick rock formations containing fossils provide the best potential tests of the competing theories
Occasionally  a sequence of fossil rich layers of rock permits a comprehensive look at one type of organism over a long period of time  For example  Peter Sheldon s studies of trilobites  a now extinct marine animal with a segmented body  offer a detailed glimpse into three million years of evolution in one marine environment  In that study  each of eight different trilobite species was observed to undergo a gradual change in the number of segments     typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time interval  No significant discontinuous were observed  leading Sheldon to conclude that environmental conditions were quite stable during the period he examined
Similar exhaustive studies are required for many different kinds of organisms from many different periods  Most researchers expect to find that both modes of transition from one species to another are at work in evolution  Slow  continuous change may be the norm during periods of environmental stability  while rapid evolution of new species occurs during periods of environment stress  But a lot more studies like Sheldon s are needed before we can say for sure

1  The word  innumerable  in the passage is closest in the meaning to
  countless
  occasional
  large
  repeated

2  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true EXCEPT
  Darwin saw evolutionary change as happening slowly and gradually
  Gaps in the fossil record were used to explain why it is difficult to see continuous small changes in the evolution of species
  Darwin s evolutionary thesis was rejected because small changes could not be observed in the evolutionary record
  By the early twentieth century  most biologists believed that gradualism explained evolutionary change



3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis challenged gradualism  which holds that species evolve in relatively sudden bursts of brief duration
  The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge was challenged in 1972
  In 1972 Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged gradualism by positing that change from one species to another cannot occur without a lengthy transition period
  The punctuate equilibrium hypothesis  in opposition to gradualism  holds that transitions from one species to another occur in comparatively sudden burst

4  According to paragraph 1 and paragraph 2  the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis and the gradualism hypothesis differed about
  Whether the fossil record is complete
  Whether all species undergo change
  Whether evolution proceeds an a constant rate
  How many new species occur over long periods of time


5  According to paragraph 3  the lack of intermediate fossils in the fossil record of some species
  has been extensively studied by paleontologist for over a century
  contradicts the idea that most species have remained unchanged for millions of years
  challenges the view that evolutionary change is gradual
  is most common in the fossil records of clam and coral species


6  The word  compelling  in the passage is closest in the meaning to
  surprising
  persuasive
  controversial
  detailed

7  Paragraph 4 mentions that North American horses have changed in all the following ways EXCEPT in
  the number of toes they have
  the length of their face
  their overall size
  the number of years they live


8  The word  alteration  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  imperfection
  replacement
  change
  duplication



9  According to paragraph 7  Peter Sheldon s studies demonstrated which of the following about trilobites
  They underwent gradual change over a long time period
  They experienced a number of discontinuous transitions during their history
  They remained unchanged during a long period of environmental stability
  They evolved in ways that cannot be counted for by either of the two competing theories


10  The word  occasionally  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  undoubtedly
  basically
  once in a while
  to some extent


11  The main purpose of paragraph 7 is to
  Describe one test of the competing theories
  Provide an example of punctuated equilibrium
  Describe how segmented animals evidence both competing theories
  Explain why trilobites became extinct


12  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence can be added to the passage
They believe that environmental conditions may play a crucial role in determining which of the two modes will be in operation over a given period
Where could the sentence best fit
