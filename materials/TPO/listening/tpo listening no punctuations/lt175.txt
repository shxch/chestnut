Ok  so one of the challenges that faced ancient civilizations like Egypt was timekeeping  calendars  When you have to grow food for whole cities of people  it is important to plant your crops at the right time  And when you start having financial obligations  rents  taxes  you have to keep track of how often you pay

So today we will look at how the Egyptians addressed these problems  In fact  they ended up using two calendars  one to keep track of the natural world  or their agriculture concerns  and another one  that was used to keep track of the business functions of the Kingdom  So let s take a look at the hows and whys of one ancient Egyptian calendar system  starting with the Nile River

Why the Nile  Well  there s no other way to put it  Egyptian life basically revolved around the mysterious rise and fall of the river  The success of their agriculture system depended upon them knowing when the river would change  So  naturally  their first calendar was divided up into three seasons  each based on the river  s changes  inundation  subsidence and harvest

The first season was the flooding  or inundation  when the Nile valley was essentially submerged in water for a few months or so  And afterwards during the season of subsidence  the water would subside  or recede  revealing a new layer of fertile black silt and allowing for the planting of various crops  And finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley would produce crops  such as wheat  barley  fruit  all ready to harvest  Ok  so it was important to the ancient Egyptians to know when their Nile based seasons would occur  their way of life depended upon it

Now  the way they used to count time was based on the phases of the moon  which  regularly and predictably  goes through a cycle  starting with a new moon  then to a full moon  and back again to the new moon  Now this cycle wes then used to determine the length of their month  So  um  one lunar cycle was one Egyptian month  and about four of the months would constitute a season  Now  12 of these months was an approximately 354 day year  So they had a 354 day agricultural calendar that was designed to help them determine when the Nile would inunadate the land

Well  of course it had to be more complicated than that  The average amount of time between floodings wasn t actually 354 days  I mean  although it varies  the average was clearly longer than 354 days  So how did they keep this short calendar in step with the actual flooding of the Nile

Well  their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star  Sirius  would disappear  Actually  it d be hidden in the glare of the Sun  And then  a couple of months later  one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn  Sirius would reappear  And it happened regularly  about every 365 days  Even more significantly  the reappearance of Sirius would occur around the same time as the Nile s flooding  And this annual event is called a heliacal rising4


The heliacal rising was a fair indicator of when the Nile would flood  The next new moon  after the heliacal rising of Sirius  which happened in the last month of the calendar year  marked the New Year  And because the ancient Egyptians were using the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising  some years ended up having 12 lunar months  while others had 13 lunar calender months  if Sirius didn t rise in the 12th month

Even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuated  with some years having 12 months and others having 13  it ended up being much more reliable than it was before  They continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of Sirius  ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons  This new calendar was ideal  because  well
it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have
traditional religious festivals  So  that was their first calendar

But was it any way to run a government  They didn t think so  For administrative purposes  it was very inconvenient to have years of different lengths  So another calendar was introduced  an administrative one  Probably soon after 3 000 BC  they declared a 365 day year  with 12 months per year  with exactly 30 days each month  with an extra 5 days at the end of each year  This administrative calendar existed alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depended on the heliacal rising of Sirius  This administrative calendar was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other things that had to be paid on time  Over time  the calendar got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the Nile  but for bureaucratic purposes  they didn t mind
