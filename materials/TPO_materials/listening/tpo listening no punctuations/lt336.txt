Lecture4 – Art History  Renaissance Gardens
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class

Professor
OK  We have been talking about the art and architecture of the Italian Renaissance  from around A D  1400 to around A D  1600  Last class  we had a look at some of the magnificent palaces and villas built during this time period  And just as class was ending  someone asked about the gardens associated with these palaces and villas  And so I d like to say a few things about them before we move on
Now  when I say gardens  I don t mean vegetable gardens or simple flower gardens  These were lavishly constructed  finely detailed gardens that covered hundreds of acres  with exotic plants and ornamental statues  And they were just as much a symbol of their owners  social position as their palaces and villas were  Again  what was the inspiration for the Renaissance  Rebecca
Student
Classical art and architecture of the ancient Greeks and Romans
Professor
That s right  As we ve said before  the main point of the Renaissance was to revive the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans  which is why designers of Renaissance gardens designed them as the ancient Romans would have designed them  or at least as they imagined the ancient Romans would have designed them
Student
How did they know what ancient Roman gardens look like
?
Professor
Well  they didn t have any pictures  But they did have some very detailed descriptions of ancient Roman villas and their gardens that had been written by famous Roman authors who lived during the height of the Roman Empire  And at least three of those authors  one was a scholar  one was a poet  and one was lawyer  were very authoritative  very reliable sources
Ah…and interestingly enough  there was another source that didn t describe classical gardens but still became a great influence on Renaissance gardens  It was also written back during the height of the Roman Empire by a mathematician known as Hero of Alexandria  Hero was a Greek  But he lived in Alexandria  Egypt  which was at the time part of the Roman Empire  Hero compiled descriptions and sketches of seventy some clever little mechanical devices  most of which utilized compressed air to cause water  or in some cases wine  to flow from one place to another  or sometimes to squirt or to make some kind of noise  Yes  John
Student
Could you give an example
Professor
Well  one of the devices was a sacrificial vessel that was obviously designed for a temple  not for a garden  Anyway  if you drop money into this vessel  water would flow out of it  Well  creative minds in the Renaissance realized that this little device could be nicely repurposed as a nifty little fountain  Designers of Renaissance gardens loved this sort of thing  They loved to incorporate novelties and tricks  things to amuse and impress guests
Student
And that was the purpose  To impress people
Professor
Sure  As a nobleman or wealthy landowner  one purpose of having a fabulous villa with a fantastic garden was to impress people  It was a way of proving your social position
?
Student
Well…OK  You also mentioned tricks
Professor
Well  for example  some gardens had plaster or marble birds that sang when water flowed through them  Some fountains were designed to squirt people with water
Student
And these things were popular
Professor
Yes  They may have been the most popular features of the gardens  I mean  flowers and statues can be nice to look at  but these things were a lot more fun  And the more clever the device is  the more famous the garden and the greater prestige the landowner enjoyed  Yes  Rebecca
Student
What about mazes  I read that they were a major part of the Renaissance gardens
Professor
Oh  yes  They certainly were  Mazes or labyrinths  as they re also called  were very common in Renaissance gardens  How that came to be though is a bit of a mystery  Mazes have a long history going back to the ancient Egyptians  but they started appearing in gardens only during the Renaissance  or perhaps just a little bit prior to that  According to one source  what happened was  in the late 1400s  a highly respected expert published a book on architecture  And readers somehow mistakenly inferred from that book that ancient Romans had mazes in their gardens  So then designers of Renaissance gardens thinking they were following in the footsteps of the ancient Romans…well…guess what they did
