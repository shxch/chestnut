Lecture1 Archaeology  Bananas & African History
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class


Professor
One of the important aspects of the field of archaeology…one of the things that excites me about the field…is that seemingly insignificant things can suddenly change the way we think about a culture We are always making new discoveries that have the potential to challenge widely held beliefs

Take something like the banana  for example  It turns out that this ordinary fruit may be forcing scientists to rewrite major parts of African history  We know the bananas were introduced to Africa via Southeast Asia  And until recently  we thought we knew when they were introduced about 2 000 years ago  But discoveries in Uganda  that s in Eastern Africa  are throwing that into question  Scientists studying soil samples there discovered evidence of bananas in sediment that was 5 000 years old
Now  let me explain that it s not easy to find traces of ancient bananas  The fruit is soft and doesn t have any hard seeds that might survive over the ages  So after 5 000 years  you might think there would be nothing left to study  Well  fortunately for archaeologists  all plants contain what are called phytoliths in their stems and leaves  Phytoliths are microscopic structures made of silica  and they do not decay  When plants die and rot away  they leave these phytoliths behind  Because different plants produce differently shaped phytoliths  scientists can identify the type of plant from ancient remains
So  those scientists in Uganda  dug down to sediments that were 5 000 years old  And what do you think they found  Banana phytoliths  Obviously this meant that we had to rethink our previous notions about when bananas first arrived in Africa  But  well  this discovery had other implications for history
As soon as bananas appear in the archaeological record  we know we have contact between Africa and Southeast Asia  It would appear now that this contact occurred much earlier than previously thought
Al…although…now here s where the uncertainty comes in…we don t really have any solid evidence of trade between the peoples of these two regions that long ago  Presumably  if people were bringing bananas to Africa  they d also be bringing other things too  pottery  tools…all sorts of objects made for trade or daily use  But any such evidence is missing from the archaeological record

The early appearance of bananas also suggests that agriculture began in this part of Africa earlier than scientists imagined You see  bananas  at least the edible kind  can t grow without human intervention  They have to be cultivated  People need to plant them and care for them  So if bananas were present in Uganda 5 000 years ago  we would have to assume…that…that…that someone planted them

But  there are questions about this too  We know that bananas can be a staple food that can support large populations  as they did in Uganda in the more recent past  If bananas were grown thousands of years ago  why don t we see evidence of large populations thriving in the area earlier

So  we are left with this mystery  We have what appears to be strong biological evidence that bananas were being cultivated in Uganda as early as 5 000 years ago  But we are missing other kinds of evidence that would conclusively prove that this is so
Clearly  more research needs to be done  Perhaps by some new scholars from this university  At least give it some thought
