Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class

Professor
Today we re going to talk about how to look at a piece of art  how to  read  it what you should look for       what aspects of it you should evaluate  A lot of people think that if you stand in front of a work of art and gaze at it for a couple of minutes  you re evaluating it  But truly reading a piece of art  evaluating it properly  is a complex process  a process that takes time
When we re confronted with a piece of art  there re several things we have to keep in mind  for example  its beauty       that s where aesthetics comes in

Aesthetics is the philosophy that deals with the definition of beauty  which goes all the way back to ancient Greece  They  um  the early Greek philosophers said that beauty and art are based on imitation  Their feeling about art was that it s beautiful when it imitates life  they thought that the truthfulness of an image  how truthful it is to life  determines its value as art  Today we have a broader definition of aesthetics
Now don t identify aesthetics as personal taste  Taste is bound by time  taste is tied to a society  a given set of moral values  usually  You may not like a piece of art from a different culture it may not be your taste but you appreciate its beauty  cause you recognize certain aesthetic principles  Art generally adheres to certain aesthetic principles like balance  uh  balanced proportions  contrast  movement  or rhythm

We ll discuss aesthetics more in detail when we look at some pieces of art together  Another thing to keep in mind in evaluating art is that art has a purpose  generally determined by the artist  You may not know what it is  and you don t need to know what it is to appreciate a piece of art  but it helps  For example  if you know what the artist s purpose is       if you know that a piece of art expresses the artist s feeling about a political or social situation  you ll probably look at it differently
Now  besides beauty and purpose  what are the other aspects of a piece of art that need to be evaluated  Very simple you examine a piece of art following these four formal steps  The first step is description       describe physical characteristics of the piece like this painting is large  it s oil on canvas  Describe the subject it s a person  it s a landscape or predominant colors like  um  earth colors       that s a description
OK  So  you ve described the piece  The next step is analysis  You re looking at the piece for any universal symbols  characters  or themes it might contain  Certain symbols are universal  and the artist counts on your understanding of symbols  Even colors have symbolic significance  as you may know  And also objects depicted in a piece of art are often used to represent an abstract idea  Like wheels or spheres they look like circles  right  so wheels and spheres represent wholeness and continuity  I have a handout  a list of these symbols and images and their interpretations  that I ll give you later  But for now  the point is that after you describe the piece of art  you analyze its content       you determine whether it contains elements that the artist is using to try to convey a certain meaning
If it does  the next step is interpretation  Interpretation follows analysis very closely  You try to interpret the meaning of the symbols you identified in the piece  Almost all art has an obvious and an implied meaning  The implied meaning is hidden in the symbolic system expressed in the piece of art  What we see depicted is one scene  but there can be several levels of meaning  Your interpretation of these symbols makes clear what the artist is trying to tell us
The last step is judgment or opinion what do you think of the piece  is it powerful or boring   but I give that hardly any weight  If the four steps were to be divided up into a chart  then description  analysis  and interpretation would take up 99 percent  Your opinion is not important in understanding a piece of art  It s nice to say  I like it       I wouldn t mind hanging it over my couch  but to evaluate a piece of art  it s not critical
OK  Now you know what I mean by  reading  a piece of art  and what it entails  Try to keep all that in mind next time you go to an art museum  I can tell you right now that you probably won t be able to look at more than 12 pieces of art during that visit
OK  now let s look at a slide of a piece of art and try to  read  it together
