TPO21 Conversation 2
Narrator Listen to a conversation between a student and her public relations professor

Student Hi  professor Gordin  I really learned a lot from your lecture  the one about analyzing all those different segments of the population  Oh  the official term is audience  right  I never imagine that one company could have over thirty audiences to communicate with

Professor Yeah  a lot of students are taken aback by this  and some public relations consultants don t figure it out until they ve worked in the field a while

Student Everyone thinks  public relations  eh  PR is easy  but there s a lot to it  You really got to know what you are doing

Professor Absolutely  So  Stacy  your email implied that you needed my advice about graduate school

Student No  since my undergraduate degree will be in public relations  I ve already decided to get a master s degree in marketing  Sorry  I wasn t clear  My issue is  I have got two require courses and two electives  I am trying to figure out which elective course is to take  My advisor suggested economics and accounting  but I am not really sure

Professor About

Student Well  I endured accounting and economics in high school and barely stayed awake  they were so

Professor Ok  Ok  I hear you  Eh    you say you wanted a master s in marketing  you have got one more semester till graduation  Have you taken any marketing courses yet

Student No  I figured I ve got the marketing basis already since I have take every PR in communication courses offered here

Professor Well  there s some overlap between PR and marketing  but there are important differences too  Marketing focuses on selling your product or service  eh  you know  attracting customers through advertising  and also building relationships with customers  That s what a marketing department does  PR is all about  it involves relationships too  that s why I am saying the two fields overlap  But in PR  you are developing relationships with a wider range of audience

Student Right  Like employees  suppliers  the media  I do understand this in theory  but aren t you still selling your product  just in a different way

Professor Not necessarily  Ok  do you remember that PR strategy I alluded to the other day  The one our university uses  a strategy that doesn t overlap its marketing strategy

Student You mean how the university invites local residents to attend certain lectures and classes for free

Professor Yeah  this cultivates a sense of good will and helps the university avoid becoming isolated from the larger community  Bringing neighbors into our classrooms is good PR  but it is not marketing since our neighbors aren t our customers  for the most part

Student That s why I want to focus on marketing in graduate school  Wouldn t having expertise in PR and marketing giving me more career options

Professor Yeah  but you ll also want to enjoy your work  So for you electives  why don t you take advertising principles and intro to marketing  which I teach  This way  you ll find out if marketing is something you really want to pursue  Graduate School tuition is expensive  and these courses will give you a good overview of the field before committing yourself

Student I wish my advisor had suggested those courses

Professor Well  I am someone who has worked in both marketing and PR  so I can offer a different perspective than someone who only teaches
