Lecture2 Music History  Béla Bartók
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class
Professor
So I just finished reviewing your papers on the influence of nationalism on the composers  music  And initially I was surprised none of you chose to write about Béla Bartók  that is until I remembered we haven t had a chance to discuss him in class yet  He was a wonderful and ground breaking composer
Béla Bartók was a Hungarian  whose life stretched from the late nineteenth century to the middle of twentieth century  But he was not a fan of the Romantic style of music that was popular in his homeland during his youth
Student
Wait  Hungary wasn t a country in 1900  was it
Professor
You are right  I should have been clear  Bartok was born in Austria Hungary  a nation that broke apart when he was about forty years old  Actually  the town where he was born is presently part of Romania  The political history of that region is complex  Suffice to say that Bartok is generally known as a Hungarian composer
So during Bartók s youth  the music played in the concert halls of Austria Hungary was dominated by Romantic pieces by mostly German composers  We discussed the Romantic style last week  These pieces were long and lyrical  They were meant to have a sort of grandeur about them  And in the early 1900s  composers who worked in the Romantic style were the most popular in Austria Hungary  But Bartok  he was part of the musical community that was trying to change this  And it led him to     well  the first thing it did was lead him to travel（此处，演讲者就是有语法错误，理解意思就行）  He looked at the countryside for the music of the farmers and the people who lived in small towns  and their music  well  you could say he discovered the music that was popular in those areas
Student
What do you mean
Professor
Well  all the music we have been talking about the past few weeks  it really was all in the cities  that s where the composers and the orchestras were  Out in remote areas of the countryside  in rural locations  music was more traditional  the same songs that were enjoyed by previous generations  Bartók went out  he travelled to a significant portion of Eastern Europe actually  He roamed the countryside and listened to the music heard in small towns and in all sorts of celebrations  He attended weddings  dances and religious ceremonies  where he heard a very different sort of music from the Romantic stuff being played in the concert halls in the cities  The music he heard is what we would consider folk music
Student
And then he had those same songs played in the concert halls
Professor
No  At first he went around to document the folk music  He really wanted to make sure the folk songs were written down before they disappeared  In fact  Bartók didn t start out the trip thinking of himself as a composer  He was an ethnomusicologist  He studied the traditional music of the region  But it turns out that what would later have a notable influence on European music on the whole  was the way Bartók used elements he heard in folk songs in his own compositions  He adopted a number of elements from what he heard  like unusual rhythms  And he liked to use the glissando as his hallmark  which he probably got from listening to Croatian folk music  A glissando is     well  I have got a recording of Bartok here  Let s wait until the music is fresh in our minds Susie  do you have something you want to ask first
Student
Yeah  Before  you mention nationalism and…
Professor
Ah  right  yes  When Bartok had his new pieces performed  their folk music roots made them instantly popular  It happened to be a time of strong nationalism in Austria Hungary  so his compositions came at just the right time  He became very successful there  Particularly  when Bartok s ballet The Wooden Prince opened  there was great excitement for music that included musical elements from local folk songs  music that reflected the region s musical traditions  However  as popular as Bartok was in his homeland  he did not get much international recognition during his lifetime
