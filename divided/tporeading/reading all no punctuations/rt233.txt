Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines
Ever since European first explored Australia  people have been trying to understand the ancient rock drawings and carvings created by the Aborigines  the original inhabitants of the continent  Early in the nineteenth century  encounters with Aboriginal rock art tended to be infrequent and open to speculative interpretation  but since the late nineteenth century  awareness of the extent and variety of Australian rock art has been growing  In the latter decades of the twentieth century there were intensified efforts to understand and record the abundance of Australian rock art

The systematic study of this art is a relatively new discipline in Australia  Over the past four decades new discoveries have steadily added to the body of knowledge  The most significant data have come from a concentration on three major questions  First  what is the age of Australian rock art  Second  what is its stylistic organization and is it possible to discern a sequence or a pattern of development between styles  Third  is it possible to interpret accurately the subject matter of ancient rock art  bring to bear all available archaeological techniques and the knowledge of present day Aboriginal informants

The age of Australia s rock art is constantly being revised  and earlier datings have been proposed as the result of new discoveries  Currently  reliable scientific evidence dates the earliest creation of art on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere between 30 000 and 50 000 years ago  This in itself is an almost incomprehensible span of generations  and one that makes Australia s rock art the oldest continuous art tradition in the world

Although the remarkable antiquity of Australia s rock art is now established  the sequences and meanings of its images have been widely debated  Since the mid 1970s  a reasonably stable picture has formed of the organization of Australian rock art  In order to create a sense of structure to this picture  researchers have relied on a distinction that still underlies the forms of much indigenous visual culture a distinction between geometric and figurative elements  Simple geometric repeated patterns circles  concentric circles  and lines constitute the iconography  characteristic images  of the earliest rock art sites found across Australia  The frequency with which certain simple motifs appear in these oldest sites has led rock art researchers to adopt a descriptive term the Panaramitee style a label which takes its name from the extensive rock pavements at Panaramitee North in desert South Australia  which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface  Certain features of these engravings lead to the conclusion that they are of great age geological changes had clearly happened after the designs had been made and local Aboriginal informants  when first questioned about them  seemed to know nothing of their origins  Furthermore  the designs were covered with  desert varnish   a glaze that develops on rock surfaces over thousands of years of exposure to the elements  The simple motifs found at Panaramitee are common to many rock art sites across Australia  Indeed  sites with engravings of geometric shapes are also to be found on the island of Tasmania  which was separated from the mainland of the continent some 10 000 years ago

In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development  with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear  Lesley Maynard  the archaeologist who coined the phrase  Panaramitee style   suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art  in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style  outlines of figures and animals   followed by a range of complex figurative styles that  unlike the pan Australian geometric tradition  tended to much greater regional diversity  While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites  which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia  in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important  In this context the simplicity of a geometric motif may be more apparent than real  Motifs of seeming simplicity can encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia  And has not twentieth century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine sequence

2  According to paragraph 1  the twentieth century approach to studying Australian rock art was different from earlier approaches because the twentieth century approach
 recognized that many different groups of Aborigines created Australian rock art
 concentrated on a limited range of Aboriginal rock art
 examined Aboriginal art from an Aboriginal rather than from a European perspective
 focused more intensely on understanding and documenting rock art
3  The word  relatively  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 completely
 comparatively
 apparently
 particularly
4  The word  discern  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 indicate
 apply
 identify
 repeat

5  The word  revised  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 discussed
 raised
 challenged
 changed



6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave ways or leave out essential information
 The oldest rock art sites have simpler motifs than the best known sites of Panaramitee North
 Because motifs primarily associated with the Panaramitee region are common in the oldest sites the term Panaramitee style has become the general term for rock art of this type
 Because the Panaramitee style is so common in the older sites  researchers have described it most extensively
 The motifs carved in the rocky surface of the Panaramitee region make up the oldest form of rock art discovered in Australia

7  According to paragraph 4  researchers have organized and structured Australian rock art by distinguishing between which of the following
 Images found at Panaramitee North and images found in other parts of Australia
 Images found in a particular type of rock layer and images found in other types of rock layers
 Images that have geometric elements and images that have figurative elements
 Images that are typically found and image that are rarely found

8  According to paragraph 4  all of the following are signs of the great age of the Panaramitee engravings EXCEPT
 The engravings consisted of simple animal drawings
 The engravings were covered with a layer of a substance known as  desert varnish
 Local Aborigines who were asked knew nothing about the origin of the engravings
 Geologic changes had occurred after the engravings were made

9  Why does the author include information about Tasmania in paragraph 4
 To provide evidence that the Panaramitee style is widespread and of great age
 To prove that Aboriginal Australians could not have made the carvings in Tasmania
 To indicate how researchers have determined how long ago Tasmania separated from the mainland
 To illustrate the importance of geometric rock art to tourism in Tasmania




10  According to paragraph 5  the complex figurative style differs from the geometric style in that the complex figurative style
 varies significantly from region to region
 is more meaningful
 appears on only a few types of rocks
 has changed little overtime

11  According to paragraph 5  Lesley Maynard made which of the following suggestions about Australian rock art
 There were a pattern of human figures being represented in a more complex style than animal figures
 Australian archaeology should concentrate on determining the sequence of styles that led up to the Panaramitee style
 The great antiquity of Australian rock art would probably make it impossible to determine the ages of the various styles found in rock art
 The geometric style of Australian rock art was replaced by increasingly complex figurative styles

12  In paragraph 5  the author indicates that twentieth century art has shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermined sequence in order to
 emphasize that it may not be possible to determine what the figures in ancient rock art represent
 suggest a reply to those who have questioned Maynard s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art
 provide a counterexample to Maynard s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art
 indicate that twentieth century art is more advanced than ancient rock art

Interest in the rock art of the original inhabitants of Australia has grown over the last two centuries




Answer Choices

 Late nineteenth century studies of Aboriginal rock art failed to recognize that a variety of styles existed
 The extreme age of the earliest Aboriginal rock art has been established but the interpretation of rock art images is still debated
 A sequence from geometric to more representative art fits many sites but does not necessarily indicate a progression from simple to complex meaning
 In determining the way in which Australian rock art was organized  archaeologists have made little distinction between geometric and figurative elements
 Older examples of rock art consist of simple  repeated geometric patterns while later rock art includes figures and animals
 Aboriginal informants were able to explain the meanings of ancient rock art symbols
