Chinese Pottery
China has one of the world s oldest continuous civilizations despite invasions and occasional foreign rule  A country as vast as China with so long lasting a civilization has a complex social and visual history  within which pottery and porcelain play a major role
The function and status of ceramics in China varied from dynasty to dynasty  so they may be utilitarian  burial  trade collectors   or even ritual objects  according to their quality and the era in which they were made  The ceramics fall into three broad types earthenware  stoneware  and porcelain for vessels  architectural items such as roof tiles  and modeled objects and figures  In addition  there was an important group of sculptures made for religious use  the majority of which were produced in earthenware
The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware temperatures  but as early as the fifteenth century B C   high temperature stonewares were being made with glazed surfaces  During the Six Dynasties period  AD 265 589   kilns in north China were producing high fired ceramics of good quality  Whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan provinces from the seventh to the tenth centuries evolved into the highly prized porcelains of the Song dynasty  AD  960 1279   long regarded as one of the high points in the history of China s ceramic industry  The tradition of religious sculpture extends over most historical periods but is less clearly delineated than that of stonewares or porcelains  for it embraces the old custom of earthenware burial ceramics with later religious images and architectural ornament  Ceramic products also include lead glazed tomb models of the Han dynasty  three color lead glazed vessels and figures of the Tang dynasty  and Ming three color temple ornaments  in which the motifs were outlined in a raised trail of slip as well as the many burial ceramics produced in imitation of vessels made in materials of higher intrinsic value
Trade between the West and the settled and prosperous Chinese dynasties introduced new forms and different technologies  One of the most far reaching examples is the impact of the fine ninth century AD  Chinese porcelain wares imported into the Arab world  So admired were these pieces that they encouraged the development of earthenware made in imitation of porcelain and instigated research into the method of their manufacture  From the Middle East the Chinese acquired a blue pigment a purified form of cobalt oxide unobtainable at that time in China that contained only a low level of manganese  Cobalt ores found in China have a high manganese content  which produces a more muted blue gray color  In the seventeenth century  the trading activities of the Dutch East India Company resulted in vast quantities of decorated Chinese porcelain being brought to Europe  which stimulated and influenced the work of a wide variety of wares  notably Delft  The Chinese themselves adapted many specific vessel forms from the West  such as bottles with long spouts  and designed a range of decorative patterns especially for the European market
Just as painted designs on Greek pots may seem today to be purely decorative  whereas in fact they were carefully and precisely worked out so that at the time  their meaning was clear  so it is with Chinese pots  To twentieth century eyes  Chinese pottery may appear merely decorative  yet to the Chinese the form of each object and its adornment had meaning and significance  The dragon represented the emperor  and the phoenix  the empress  the pomegranate indicated fertility  and a pair of fish  happiness  mandarin ducks stood for wedded bliss  the pine tree  peach  and crane are emblems of long life  and fish leaping from waves indicated success in the civil service examinations  Only when European decorative themes were introduced did these meanings become obscured or even lost
From early times pots were used in both religious and secular contexts  The imperial court commissioned work and in the Yuan dynasty  A D  1279 1368  an imperial ceramic factory was established at Jingdezhen  Pots played an important part in some religious ceremonies  Long and often lyrical descriptions of the different types of ware exist that assist in classifying pots  although these sometimes confuse an already large and complicated picture
