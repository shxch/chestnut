Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources to be harnessed to reduce the workload of people and animals  No one knows exactly when the waterwheel was invented  but irrigation systems existed at least 5 000 years ago  and it seems probable that the earliest waterpower device was the noria  a waterwheel that raised water for irrigation in attached jars  The device appears to have evolved no later than the fifth century B C   perhaps independently in different regions of the Middle and Far East
The earliest waterpower mills were probably vertical axis mills for grinding corn  known as Norse or Greek mills  which seem to have appeared during the first or second century B C  in the Middle East and a few centuries later in Scandinavia  In the following centuries  increasingly sophisticated waterpower mills were built throughout the Roman Empire and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe  In England  the Saxons are thought to have used both horizontal and vertical axis wheels  The first documented English mill was in the eighth century  but three centuries later about 5 000 were recorded  suggesting that every settlement of any size had its mill
Raising water and grinding corn were by no means the only uses of the waterpower mill  and during the following centuries  the applications of waterpower kept pace with the developing technologies of mining  iron working  paper making  and the wool and cotton industries  Water was the main source of mechanical power  and by the end of the seventeenth century  England alone is thought to have had some 20 000 working mill
There was much debate on the relative efficiencies of different types of waterwheels  The period from about 1650 until 1800 saw some excellent scientific and technical investigations of different designs  They revealed output powers ranging from about 1 horsepower to perhaps 60 for the largest wheels and confirmed that for maximum efficiency  the water should pass across the blades as smoothly as possible and fall away with minimum speed  having given up almost all of its kinetic energy   They also proved that  in principle  the overshot wheel  a type of wheel in which an overhead stream of water powers the wheel  should win the efficiency competition
But then steam power entered the scene  putting the whole future of waterpower in doubt  An energy analyst writing in the year 1800 would have painted a very pessimistic picture of the future for waterpower  The coal fired steam engine was taking over  and the waterwheel was fast becoming obsolete  However  like many later experts  this one would have suffered from an inability to see into the future  A century later the picture was completely different  by then  the world had an electric industry  and a quarter of its generating capacity was water powered
The growth of the electric power industry was the result of a remarkable series of scientific discoveries and development in electrotechnology during the nineteenth century  but significant changes in what we might now call hydro  water  technology also played their part  In 1832  the year of Michael Faraday s discovery that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field  a young French engineer patented a new and more efficient waterwheel  His name was Benoit Fourneyron  and his device was the first successful water turbine   The word turbine comes from the Latin turbo  something that spins   The waterwheel  unaltered for nearly 2 000 years  had finally been superseded
Half a century of development was needed before Faraday s discoveries in electricity were translated into full scale power stations  In 1881 the Godalming power station in Surrey  England  on the banks of the Wey River  created the world s first public electricity supply  The power source of this most modern technology was a traditional waterwheel  Unfortunately this early plant experienced the problem common to many forms of renewable energy  the flow in the Wey River was unreliable  and the waterwheel was soon replaced by a steam engine
From this primitive start  the electric industry grew during the final 20 years of the nineteenth century at a rate seldom if ever exceeded by any technology  The capacity of individual power stations  many of them hydro plants  rose from a few kilowatts to over a megawatt in less than a decade

  when exactly the very first waterpower devices were invented
  when exactly the very first waterpower devices were developed
  whether water was one of the earliest sources of power to be used by humans
 	whether the very earliest waterpower devices arose independently


3  According to paragraph 2  what was true of the waterpower mills built throughout the Roman Empire
  Most had horizontal axis wheels
  Their design was based on mills that had long been used in Scandinavia
  Their design was more popular beyond the Empire s boundaries than it was within the Empire
  They are more advanced than the mills used in the Middle East at an earlier time

4  The phrase  the application of waterpower  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  the uses to which waterpower was put
  the improvement made to waterpower
