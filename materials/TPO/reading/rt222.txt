The Birth of Photography

Perceptions of the visible world were greatly altered by the invention of photography in the middle of the nineteenth century  In particular  and quite logically  the art of painting was forever changed  though not always in the ways one might have expected  The realistic and naturalistic painters of the mid  and late nineteenth century were all intently aware of photography as a thing to use  to learn from  and react to
Unlike most major inventions  photography had been long and impatiently awaited  The images produced by the camera obscura  a boxlike device that used a pinhole or lens to throw an image onto a ground glass screen or a piece of white paper  were already familiar the device had been much employed by topographical artists like the Italian painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the city of Venice  What was lacking was a way of giving such images permanent form  This was finally achieved by Louis Daguerre  1787 1851   who perfected a way of fixing them on a silvered copper plate  His discovery  the  daguerreotype   was announced in 1839
A second and very different process was patented by the British inventor William Henry Talbot  1800 1877  in 1841  Talbot s  calotype  was the first negative to positive process and the direct ancestor of the modern photograph  The calotype was revolutionary in its use of chemically treated paper in which areas hit by light became dark in tone  producing a negative image  This  negative   as Talbot called it  could then be used to print multiple positive images on another piece of treated paper
The two processes produced very different results  The daguerreotype was a unique image that reproduced what was in front of the camera lens in minute  unselective detail and could not be duplicated  The calotype could be made in series  and was thus the equivalent of an etching or an engraving  Its general effect was soft edged and tonal
One of the things that most impressed the original audience for photography was the idea of authenticity  Nature now seemed able to speak for itself  with a minimum of interference  The title Talbot chose for his book  The Pencil of Nature  the first part of which was published in 1844   reflected this feeling  Artists were fascinated by photography because it offered a way of examining the world in much greater detail  They were also afraid of it  because it seemed likely to make their own efforts unnecessary
Photography did indeed make certain kinds of painting obsolete the daguerreotype virtually did away with the portrait miniature  It also made the whole business of making and owning images democratic  Portraiture  once a luxury for the privileged few  was suddenly well within the reach of many more people
In the long term  photography s impact on the visual arts was far from simple  Because the medium was so prolific  in the sense that it was possible to produce a multitude of images very cheaply  it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art  rather than its destined successor  Even those artists who were most dependent on photography became reluctant to admit that they made use of it  in case this compromised their professional standing
The rapid technical development of photography the introduction of lighter and simpler equipment  and of new emulsions that coated photographic plates  film  and paper and enabled images to be made at much faster speeds had   some unanticipated consequences  Scientific experiments made by photographers such as Eadweard Muybridge  1830 1904  and Etienne Jules Marey  1830 1904  demonstrated that the movements of both humans and animals differed widely from the way they had been traditionally represented in art  Artists  often reluctantly  were forced to accept the evidence provided by the camera  The new candid photography unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken confirmed these scientific results  and at the same time  thanks to the radical cropping  trimming  of images that the camera often imposed  suggested new compositional formats  The accidental effects obtained by candid photographers were soon being copied by artists such as the French painter Degas



1  What can be inferred from paragraphs 1 and 2 about the effect of photography on nineteenth century painting
 Photography did not significantly change the way people looked at reality
 Most painters used the images of the camera obscura in preference to those of the daguerreotype
 Painters who were concerned with realistic or naturalistic representation were particularly influenced by photography
 Artists used the long awaited invention of photography in just the ways they had expected to
2  According to paragraphs 2 and 3 which of the following did the daguerreotype and the calotype have in common
 They were equally useful for artists
 They could be reproduced
 They produced a permanent image
 They were produced on treated paper
3  The word  duplicated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 copied
 replaced
 handled
 clarified
4  The phrase  Its general effect  in the passage refers to
 the camera lens
 the calotype
 the etching
 the engraving
5  The word  authenticity  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 improvement
 practicality
 genuineness
 repetition


6  What point does the author make in paragraph 6
 Paintings became less expensive because of competition with photography
 Photography  unlike painting  was a type of portraiture that even ordinary people could afford
 Every style of painting was influenced by the invention of photography
 The daguerreotype was more popular than the calotype



7  The word  reluctant  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 unable
 embarrassed
 unlikely
 unwilling

8  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Photography did not replace other fine arts because people felt the image looked cheap in relation to the other arts
 Photography was not considered a true art because people could use it to create many images cheaply
 Photography was so cheap and readily available that it could be purchased by people who were too poor to purchase fine art
 Photography not only spread quickly but  also was a cheap art form and so became true successor of fine arts rather than its poor relation


9  The word  unanticipated  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 indirect
 not expected
 unquestionable
 beneficial
10  The word  accidental  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 surprising
 unintentional
 realistic
 unusual
11  Which of the following is mentioned in paragraph 8 as a benefit that artists derived from photography
 It inspired artists to use technological themes in their painting
 It lent prestige to those artists who used photographs as models for paintings
 It provided artists with new types of equipment to speed up the painting process
 It motivated artists to think about new ways to compose images in their paintings
12  It can be inferred from paragraph 8 that one effect that photography had on painting was that it
 provided painters with new insights into how humans and animals actually move
 showed that representing movement could be as interesting as portrait art
 increased the appeal of painted portraiture among the wealthy
 influenced artists to improve techniques for painting faster

Answer Choices

 For a brief time  artists preferred not to paint natural or realistic images that would have to compete with photographs
 Before photography  Canaletto had used the camera obscura to project scenes onto a paper or glass plate
 The photographic processes of Louis Daguerre and William Henry Talbot both made permanent images  but only Talbot s process allowed making multiple copies
 The work of Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne Jules Marey established photography both as a science and as an art
 Photography made accurate images widely and inexpensively available  but this popular success also had the effect of lowering its perceived value in relation to the fine arts
 Photography eliminated the painted portrait miniature  led artists to accurately represent movement  and affected pictorial composition  but did not replace traditional visual arts
