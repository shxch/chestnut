Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class  The class is discussing animal behavior

Professor
Ok  the next kind of animal behavior I want to talk about might be familiar to you  You may have seen  for example  a bird that s in the middle of a mating ritual  and suddenly it stops and preens  you know  it takes a few moments to straighten its feathers  and then returns to the mating ritual  This kind of behavior  this doing something that seems completely out of place  is what we call a  Displacement Activity

Displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives  If we take our example from a minute ago  if the bird is afraid of its mate  it s conflicted  It wants to mate but it s also afraid and wants to run away  So  instead  it starts grooming itself  So  the displacement activity  the grooming  the straightening of its feathers  seems to be an irrelevant behavior

So  what do you think another example of a displacement activity might be

Karl
How about an animal that  um  instead of fighting its enemy or running away  it attacks a plant or a bush

Professor
That s really good suggestion  Karl  But that s called  redirecting   The animal is redirecting its behavior to another object  in this case  the plant or the bush  But that s not an irrelevant or inappropriate behavior  The behavior makes sense  It s appropriate under the circumstances  But what doesn t make sense is the object the behavior s directed towards

Ok  who else  Carol

Carol
I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food – next to the animal s food  And the animal  it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food  so instead  it just fell asleep  Like that

Professor
That s exactly what I mean  Displacement occurs because the animal s got two conflicting drives – two competing urges  in this case  fear and hunger  And what happens is  they inhibit each other  they cancel each other out in a way  and a third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call  Disinhibition

Now  in disinhibition  the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit  to hold back  a third drive  Well  well  they re getting in a way of each other in a… in a conflict situation and somehow lose control  lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior  which means that the third drive surfaces  it s expressed in the animal s behavior

Now  these displacement activities can include feeding  drinking  grooming  even sleeping  These are what we call  Comfort Behavior   So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors  such as grooming

Karl
Maybe because it s easy for them to do  I mean  grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do  It s something they do all the time  and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming  or if food is right in front of them  Basically  they don t have to think very much about those behaviors

Carol
Professor  isn t it possible that animals groom because they ve got messed up a little from fighting or mating  I mean if a bird s feathers get ruffled or an animal s fur  maybe it s not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point

Professor
That s another possible reason although it doesn t necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating  drinking or sleeping

What s interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal s environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays  For example  there s a bird  the  wood thrush   anyway  when the  wood thrush  is in an attack escape conflict  that is  it s caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy  if it s sitting on a horizontal branch  it ll wipe its beak on its perch  If it s sitting on a vertical branch  it ll groom its breast feathers  The immediate environment of the bird  its immediate  um  its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior will display
