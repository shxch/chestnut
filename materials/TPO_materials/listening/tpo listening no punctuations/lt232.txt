TPO23 Lecture l  Archaeology  Antikythera  Mechanism
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class
Professor  I was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics department the other day  and we ended up discussing how one discovery can change everything  My colleague mentioned how the theory of relativity completely changed the field of physics  At any rates  that conversation got me thinking about archaeological finds that really changed our understanding of ancient civilizations  So I want to talk about the discovery of the Antikythera Mechanism
The Antikythera Mechanism was found a hundred years ago  under water in an ancient Greek shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea  It was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces  But once we figured out what it was and reconstructed it  Well  I simply don t have the words to convey how extraordinary this find was
The Antikythera Mechanism is a relatively small device  roughly the size of a shoebox  made of gears fitted inside a wooden case  In its original state  there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top  with letters and drawings showing the Sun  the phases of the moon and different constellations  Inside the box  bronze gears would have rotated the displays  The displays  uh  the indicators of the Antikythera Mechanism  would then moved to show the motion of the Sun and moon relative to the planets and stars  The device could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more
Well  scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the mechanism and re examine the other cargo in the ship wreck  and the evidence makes an absolute case that this device dates back to ancient Greece somewhere between 150 and 100 B C E  What makes that so fascinating is that before we found the Antikythera Mechanism  the earliest device we had that could track the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1 000 years later  So when this was first found  people literally would not believe it  Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B C E  But this physical evidence was conclusive  It was that old
Of course part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera Mechanism is constructed of bronze  Now  it is not that bronze was all that rare in Greece then  it is just that bronze was valuable and could easily be recycled  It would have been relatively easy for a person with knowledge of metals to melt down bronze objects and forge them into   well  say  coins  Bronze was used to made money back then  Or mold the bronze into anything else of value for that matter
We are very fortunate that the device ended up under water  because otherwise it probably would have ended up recycled into   who knows what  Now  it was a challenge to figure out the Antikythera Mechanism  It spent over 2 000 years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered  And even after it was discovered  it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was  You see  the mechanism had corroded underwater  and many of the gears were stuck together in a mass  Cleaning it was only partly successful  We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma rays were used to see inside  very similar to the way X rays are used to see your bones
Now  once we got a good look inside  we saw a really complex device  The many gears not only moved in a way that could indicate the phases of the moon  The Antikythera Mechanism also tracked both the lunar year and the solar year  Additionally  the gears also moved to match the motions of the planet and predicted eclipses  But one thing that is particularly notable is that the mechanism was so precise that it even took into account a particular irregularity in the moon s orbit  which requires some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device
You could say that the Antikythera Mechanism was a very precise calendar  which stands to reasons calendars were very important to ancient peoples  Religious festivals had to be held at the right time of year  crops needed to be planted at the right time as well  And let s not forget that eclipses in planetary motions had important symbolic meanings
