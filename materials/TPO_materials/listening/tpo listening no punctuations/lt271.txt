Conversation1 In the Library

Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation at the information desk in the library

Librarian
Hi  Can I help you

Student
Where do I go  besides the computers  to look for books on New Zealand

Librarian
OK  You mean you don t want to use the computer

Student
Well  I haven t had any luck on the computers here

Librarian
OK  I mean the reason I am asking is you pretty much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is  But I can help you find it on the computer if you like

Student
That would be great  I just spent half an hour and I couldn t find anything

Librarian
I know how you feel  When I first started working here  I couldn t find anything either  So you are looking for information on New Zealand  is that right

Student
Yes

Librarian
Is it like travel information that you are looking for

Student
Uh… No  Actually what I am looking for is information on a volcano in New Zealand

Librarian
Oh  OK  Because I know a travel agency that specializes in tours in New Zealand and Australia

Student
Oh  I d love to go  I heard it s beautiful

Librarian
Yeah

Student
Maybe someday

Librarian
Yup  OK  Let s see … OK  If you want to search the library holdings and don t know the author s name or the exact title of the book or an article  you have to set up a keyword search  It is a special function  Then you can just type in some keywords and let the computer do the search

Student
I see

Librarian
OK  Oh  how about if we search for volcanoes and New Zealand

Student
Sounds good

Librarian
It s for a geology class

Student
Mhmm

Librarian
Ha  You must be from Professor Simpson s class

Student
No

Librarian
Oh  Well  he is a volcano expert  so I thought he might be teaching your class

Student
No  I ve heard he is really good though

Librarian
Yeah  That s what everyone says  Do you know the name of the volcano

Student
Mount Ruapehu

Librarian
Can you spell that

Student
Sure  It is R U A P E H U

Librarian
OK  Mount Ruapehu  Let s see  So are you a geology major

Student
Hem  Hardly

Librarian
Let me guess  you have to take a science course and you don t want to have to deal with biology  chemistry or physics

Student
Exactly  But it s actually turned out to be a pretty interesting class

Librarian
Well  that s good  Um… does it have to be a book  Or could you use a journal article

Student
Mhmm… no  either one would be fine

Librarian
OK  Well  here s a journal article  Let me check to see if we have it  OK  We have the article  but it is from 2001  Is that OK  you think

Student
Well  I d like to have a look at it  The focus is really on eruptions in the last five years  but it might have some useful background material

Librarian
OK  Well  let s see what else we can find

Student
Sounds good
