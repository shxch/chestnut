Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes

A conspicuous sign indicating the presence of white tailed deer in a woodlot is a buck rub  A male deer makes a buck rub by striping the bark  outer layer  of a small tree with its antlers  When completed  the buck rub is an obvious visual signal to us and presumable to other deer in the area  A rub is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer  one meter or less above the ground  on a smooth barked  small diameter  16 25 millimeters  tree  The smooth bark of small red maples makes this species ideal for buck rubs in the forests of the mid eastern United States

Adult male deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outer velvet layer is being shed from their antlers  Rubs are created about one to two months before the breeding season  the rut   Hence for a long time biologists believed that male deer used buck rubs not only to clean and polish antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male to male combat during the rut  However  biologists also noted deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar rub  which suggests that this visual mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer

Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the rub is made  These odors make buck rubs an important means of olfactory communication between deer  The importance of olfactory communication  using odors to communicate  in the way of life of deer was documented by a study of captive adult male deer a few decades ago  which noted that males rubbed their foreheads on branches and twigs  especially as autumn approached  A decade later another study reported that adult male white tailed deer exhibited forehead rubbing just before and during the rut  It was found that when a white tailed buck makes a rub  it moves both antlers and forehead glands along the small tree in a vertical direction  This forehead rubbing behavior coincides with a high level of glandular activity in the modified scent glands found on the foreheads of male deer  the glandular activity causes the forehead pelage  hairy covering  of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males

Forehead rubbing by male deer on buck rubs presumably sends a great deal of information to other members of the same species  First  the chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal  no two mammals produce the same scent  For instance  as we all know  dogs recognize each other via smell  Second  because only male deer rub  the buck rub and its associated chemicals indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub  Third  older  more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and probably deposit more glandular secretions on a given rub  Thus the presence of many well marked rubs is indicative of older  higher status males being in the general vicinity rather than simply being a crude measure of relative deer abundance in a given area  The information conveyed by the olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer species  such as trumpeting by bull elk

Because both sexes of white tailed respond to buck rubs by smelling and licking them  rubs may serve a very important additional function  Fresher buck rubs  less than two days old   in particular  are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs  In view of this behavior it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help physiologically induce and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs  This would be an obvious advantage to wide ranging deer  especially to a socially dominant buck when courting several adult females during the autumn rut  Another visual signal produced by while tailed deer is termed a buck scrape  Scrapes consist of a clearing  about 0 5 meter in diameter  and shallow depression made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground  after making the scrape  the deer typically urinates in the depression  Thus  like a buck rub  a scrape is both a visual and an olfactory signal  Buck scrapes are generally created after leaf fall in autumn  which is just before or during the rut  Scrapes are usually placed in open or conspicuous places  such as along a deer trail  Most are made by older males  although females and younger males  2 5 years old or less  occasionally make scrapes

1  The word  conspicuous  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  noticeable
  common
  strange
  particular

2  According to paragraph 1  why are small red maple trees ideal for buck rubs
  They have smooth bark
  They are found in the mid eastern United States
  They grow very slowly
  They tend to grow in open spaces


3  The studies of forehead rubbing by deer described in paragraph 3 showed that
  forehead rubbing encourages the growth of antlers
  male deer and white tailed deer behave differently during the rut
  the rut can occur at different times of the year
  deer convey important information through scent

4  The word  exhibited  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  relied on
  increased
  displayed
  preferred




5  Why does the author mention that  dogs recognize each other via smell
  To point out the similarities between dogs and deer
  To argue that animals communicate through scent rather than through vision
  To support the claim that the scent of a buck rub serves to identify its maker to other deer
  To suggest that buck rubs can be detected by other species

6  The word  crude  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  rough
  useful
  necessary
  obvious

7  What can be inferred from paragraph 4 about the trumpeting of bull elk
  Trumpeting by higher status bull elk signals their presence to other members of their species
  Bull elk need to combine trumpeting with olfactory signals to convey information about their identity
  Trumpeting alerts white tailed deer to the presence of bull elk in their vicinity
  Trumpeting provides a better measure of deer presence in a given area than buck rubs do

8  According to paragraph 4  the buck rubs occurring in a given area reveal all of the following information about deer EXCEPT
  the individual identity of the deer
  the gender of the deer
  the likely social status of the deer
  the number of deer in the vicinity









9  The word  induce  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  increase
  extend
  delay
  stimulate


10  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is true about chemicals in buck rubs
  They have to be at least two days old for females to be able to detect them
  They are more effective in older buck rubs than in fresher ones
  They may affect fertility in female deer
  They can be more easily detected by young males than adult females


11  The word  termed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  associated with
  visible as
  known as
  provided by


12  According to the passage  in what way do buck scrapes differ from buck rubs
  Buck scrapes are made by both male and female deer
  Buck scrapes are purely visual signals
  Buck scrapes are made closer to the breeding season than buck rubs
  Buck scrapes can be smelled only by deer

Buck rubs and buck scrapes are two types of markings made by white tailed deer







Answer Choices

  The observation that deer sniff and lick buck rubs first led scientists to connect buck rubs with combat between adult males during the breeding season
  Buck rubs and buck scrapes are visual signals and smells that deer use to communicate a variety of information to other deer
  The number of buck rubs and buck scrapes in a given area changes as the density of the population of male deer in the area changes
  As they rub the bark from trees  male deer leave behind chemicals produced by the glands in their foreheads  creating a scent that other deer can detect
  The height of a buck rub  the type of tree used  and the direction in which the deer applies the rub can give different kinds of information to other deer
  Buck rubs are created close to the breeding season of deer and may affect the timing of fertility in the female deer that visit the rubs
