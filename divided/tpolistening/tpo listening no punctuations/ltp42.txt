When attempting to understand international trade  some things seem so obvious that they can hardly be controverted  and other points that are important are invisible unless you ve thought about the subject carefully
Consider the following  if there s an increase in imports  let s say  um  let s say imports of furniture  and the domestic producers of furniture find this new competition very difficult and are cutting production and employment  then it seems obvious and easy to understand and many people conclude from this that increasing imports will cause generally greater unemployment at home
What is not so obvious is that how much we import and how much we export     those are interdependent and you can t understand the one without the other  But the exports that are generated are not easily discernable  so most people don t see them  They see only the imports of furniture rising and employment in domestic furniture production falling
So as a result  many people argue that we ought to protect jobs by limiting imports either by tariffs  quotas  regulations  or whatever without realizing that this also has the effect of reducing potential future exports to the rest of the world  things that we can produce very  very       cost effectively and therefore profitably
The fundamental proposition in international economics is that it makes sense to import those things that we       that can be produced more economically abroad than at home and export things to the rest of the world that we can produce more cost effectively than produced elsewhere in the world  Therefore  if we limit imports  we put ourselves in danger of not being able to export
The details of this relationship will take much longer to explain than I can fully go into now but the point of the matter is that gains the benefits of gains from international trade result from being able to get things cheaper by buying them abroad than you can make them at home  Now there re some things that we can make at home that are       that we can do more economically than they can do abroad
In the case of the United States  typically high technology products  uh       are things that Americans have innovated in and started firms doing that sort of thing at which they do very well  Whereas goods that produce       that use a lot of relatively low skill labor  like furniture production  cotton production  sugar production       those are things that are frequently made more inexpensively in places where wage rates are low and the cost of using capital is very high
However  in Florida they produce a lot of sugar  but the costs are so high  if we didn t have extensive restrictions on imports of sugar  the output of sugar would decline dramatically  But the sugar industry in the U S  doesn t produce high paying jobs  it uses resources in ineffective ways and it blocks the import of more cost effectively produced sugar  It  it s a very bad bargain for the people in the United States to want to protect low paying jobs thereby halting the growth of world trading and international       uh  more international specialization  It would be better to remove restrictions on imports and allow other countries in the world       countries that can produce them more cheaply       let them specialize in producing those products
Now  I agree that people who are directly affected by imports  what they focus on       is  is that their prospects       their job prospects are being reduced  and their economic circumstances are getting worse  And that s a relevant problem and an important problem  what isn t so obvious is       that by retraining and relocating people to places and industries where jobs are expanding rather than contracting  we can make the whole economy function more effectively and productively than by trying to block imports
Um  what is interesting to note is that  even if there were no international trade issues  like imports  any changes that occur in a country s economy any new technology  change in preferences  change in regulations or whatever will lead to  adjustments  that lead some sectors of the economy to decline and others to expand
And that s what we have to figure out  and that s a hard problem to deal with in detail  is how to facilitate people adjusting from sectors where their job prospects are not so good  and in particular where real wages aren t so high  to acquire skills that will permit them to move into higher paying jobs in other parts of the economy either by retraining or relocating  Helping pay for the relocation of these people would be very helpful  but trying to block the changes is really counterproductive  It makes people in our country poorer  and it makes people elsewhere in the world poorer as well
