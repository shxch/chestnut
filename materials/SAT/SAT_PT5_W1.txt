Questions 1-11 are based on the following passage.
Prehistoric Printing
Paleontologists are using modern technology to gain
a greater understanding of the distant past. With the aid
of computed tomography (CT) scanning and 3-D
printing, researchers are able to create accurate models of
prehistoric fossils. 1 These models have expanded

At this point, the writer is considering adding the
following sentence.
Fossils provide paleontologists with a convenient
way of estimating the age of the rock in which
the fossils are found.
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Yes, because it supports the paragraph’s
argument with an important detail.
B) Yes, because it provides a logical transition from
the preceding sentence.
C) No, because it is not directly related to the main
point of the paragraph.
D) No, because it undermines the main claim of the
paragraph.

to advance the field of paleontology in the years to come.
CT scanners use X-rays to map the surface of a fossil
in minute detail, recording as many as one million data
points to create a digital blueprint. A 3-D printer then
builds a polymer model based on this blueprint, much as
a regular computer printer reproduces digital documents
on paper. 3 Whereas the head of an ordinary computer
printer moves back and forth while printing ink onto
paper, the corresponding part of a 3-D printer moves in
multiple dimensions while squirting out thin layers of
melted polymer plastic. The plastic hardens quickly,
4 it allows the printer to build the layers of the final
model. Compared with older ways of modeling fossils,
scanning and printing in this way is extremely versatile.

The writer is considering deleting the underlined
sentence. Should the sentence be kept or deleted?
A) Kept, because it helps explain why X-rays are
used in CT scanners.
B) Kept, because it provides details to illustrate how
a 3-D printer works.
C) Deleted, because it contradicts the passage’s
information about digital blueprints.
D) Deleted, because it creates confusion about how
researchers gather data.

[1] One significant benefit of 3-D printing
technology is its ability to create scale reproductions of
fossils. [2] But now 3-D scale models can be rearranged
with ease, which is a huge boon to scientists. [3] A team
led by Drexel University professor Kenneth Lacovara is
making models of dinosaur bones one-tenth the bones’
original sizes 5 in order to learn how they fit together
when the animals were alive. [4] In the past, such
research was limited by the weight and bulk of the fossils
as well as 6 its preciousness and fragility. [5] In many
cases, scientists had to rearrange bones virtually, using
artists’ renderings. 7
Because CT scanners can map objects that are
impossible to excavate, CT scanning and 3-D printing
can also be used to reproduce fossils that scientists
cannot observe firsthand. 8 By contrast, researchers

To make this paragraph most logical, sentence 2
should be placed
A) where it is now.

from the National Museum of Brazil 9 has relied on
this technique to study a fossilized skeleton that was
discovered protruding from a rock at an old São Paulo
railroad site. 10 The fossil was too delicate to be
removed from the rock. Because of the fossil’s delicate
nature, the team dug up a block of stone around the fossil
and brought it to their lab. With the aid of a CT scanner
and a 3-D printer, they were able to produce a resin
model of the fossil. Examining the model, the researchers
determined that 11 one had found a new species, a
75-million-year-old crocodile. While not every discovery
will be as dramatic as this one, paleontologists anticipate
further expanding their knowledge of ancient life-forms
as CT scanning and 3-D printing continue to make fossils
more accessible.

Which choice most effectively combines the
underlined sentences?
A) The fossil could not be removed from the rock
on account of it being too delicate; moreover, the
team dug up a block of stone around it and
brought it to their lab.
B) The team thought the fossil was too delicate to
remove from the rock, and their next decision
was to dig up a block of stone around the fossil
and bring it to their lab.
C) The fossil was too delicate to be removed from
the rock, so the team dug up a block of stone
around the fossil and brought it to their lab.
D) In removing the fossil from the rock, the team
found it was too delicate; then they dug up a
block of stone around the fossil and brought it to
their lab.
