Up until now in our discussions and readings about the Baroque and early classical periods
we ve been talking about the development of musical styles and genres within the
relatively narrow social context of its patronage by the upper classes  Composers  after all  had to earn a living and those who were employed in the services of a specific patron  well  I don t have to spell it out for you  the likes and dislikes of that patron  this would ve had an effect on what was being composed and performed  Now  of course  there were many other influences on composers  um  such as the technical advances we ve seen and the development of some of the instruments  uh  you remember the transverse flute  the clarinet and so on

But I think if I were asked to identify a single crucial development in European music of this time  it would be the invention of the piano  which  interestingly enough also had a significant effect on European society of that time  And I ll get to that in a minute

Now  as we know  keyboard instruments existed long before the piano   the organ  which dates back to the Middle Ages  as do other keyboard instruments  such as the harpsichord which is still popular today with some musicians  But none of these has had as profound an impact as the piano

Uh  the piano was invented in Italy in 1709  The word piano is short for pianoforte  a combination of the Italian words for soft and loud  Now  unlike the harpsichord which came before it  the piano is a percussion instrument  You see  the harpsichord is actually classified as a string instrument  since pressing a key of a harpsichord causes a tiny quill that s connected to the key to pluck the strings that are inside the instrument  much the same as a guitar pick plucks the strings of a guitar But pressing the keys of a piano causes tiny felt covered hammers to strike the strings inside the instrument  like drumsticks striking the head of a drum  This striking action is why the piano is a percussion instrument instead of a string instrument

Okay  so why is this so important  Well  the percussive effect of those little hammers means that the pianist  unlike the harpsichordist  can control the dynamics of the sound   how softly or loudly each note is struck  hence the name  pianoforte  soft and loud

Now  artistically for both composers and performers this was a major turning point  This brand new instrument  capable of producing loud and soft tones  greatly expanded the possibilities for conveying emotion  This capacity for increased expressiveness  in fact  was essential to the Romantic style that dominated 19th century music  But I m getting ahead of myself

Um  before we get back to the musical impact of this development  I wanna take a look at the social impact that I mentioned earlier

Now  in the late 1700s and the earlier 1 800s  the development of the piano coincided with the growth of the middle class in Western Europe  Of course folk music  traditional songs and dances had always been part of everyday life  But as mass production techniques were refined in the 19th century  the price of pianos dropped to the point that a larger proportion of the population could afford to own them  As pianos became more available  they brought classical music  the music which previously had been composed only for the upper classes  into the lives of the middle class people as well

One way in particular that we can see the social impact of this instrument is its role in the lives of women of the time  Previously  it was quite rare for a woman to perform on anything  but maybe a harp or maybe she sang  But suddenly in the 19th century it became quite acceptable  even  to some extent  almost expected for a middle class European woman to be able to play the piano  partly because among upper middle class women it was a sign of refinement  But it was also an excellent way for some women to earn money by giving piano lessons

And some women  those few who had exceptional talent and the opportunity to develop it  their lives were dramatically affected  Later we ll be listening to works by a composer named Robert Schumann  But let s now talk about his wife Clara Schumann  Clara Schumann was born in Germany in 1819  She grew up surrounded by pianos  Her father sold pianos and both her parents were respected piano teachers  She learned to play the instrument when she was a small child and gave her first public recital at age 9  Clara grew up to become a well known and respected piano virtuoso  a performer of extraordinary skill who not only gave concerts across Europe  but also was one of the first important female composers for the instrument
