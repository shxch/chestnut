settlers traversing the American West by train in the
mid-1800s often found 12 themselves in need of
refreshment. However, food available on rail lines was

dining cars. These Harvey Houses, which constituted the
first restaurant chain in the United States, 15 was unique

His restaurants were immediately successful, but
Harvey was not content to follow conventional business
practices. 17 Although women did not traditionally
work in restaurants in the nineteenth century, Harvey
decided to try employing women as waitstaff. In 1883, he
placed an advertisement seeking educated,
well-mannered, articulate young women between the
ages of 18 and 30. 18 Response to the advertisement was
overwhelming, even tremendous, and Harvey soon
replaced the male servers at his restaurants with women.
Those who were hired as “Harvey Girls” joined an elite
group of workers, who were expected to complete a
30-day training program and follow a strict code of rules
for conduct and curfews. In the workplace, the women
donned identical black-and-white uniforms and carried
out their duties with precision. Not only were such
regulations meant to ensure the efficiency of the business
and the safety of the workers, 19 but also helped to raise
people’s generally low opinion of the restaurant industry.
