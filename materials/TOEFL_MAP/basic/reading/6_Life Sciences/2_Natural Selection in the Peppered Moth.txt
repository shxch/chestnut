Natural Selection in the Peppered Moth

Charles Darwin was one of the first men to promote the theory of natural selection. It concerns how living things evolve. Organisms evolve because their living conditions change. So they respond in order to continue living. But only the strongest members of a species survive. They breed and produce new generations. These inherit or adapt the traits that helped the previous generations survive.

The peppered moth is native to England. It successfully adapted in response to changes in its environment. In the past, some moths were dark in color. Others were light. They all lived in trees. During the Industrial Revolution, many trees turned dark due to soot from factories. The dark peppered moths hid in the soot. But predators easily saw the light-colored moths on the dark trees. The dark moths survived. All of the light-colored moths were eaten. Within a few generations, nearly all peppered moths were dark colored.
