Crafts in the Ancient near East

Some of the earliest human civilizations arose in southern Mesopotamia  in what is now southern Iraq  in the fourth millennium B C E  In the second half of the millennium  in the south around the city of Uruk  there was an enormous escalation in the area occupied by permanent settlements  A large part of that increase took place in Uruk itself  which became a real urban center surrounded by a set of secondary settlements  While population estimates are notoriously unreliable  scholars assume that Uruk inhabitants were able to support themselves from the agricultural production of the field surrounding the city  which could be reached with a daily commute  But Uruk s dominant size in the entire region  far surpassing that of other settlements  indicates that it was a regional center and a true city  Indeed  it was the first city in human history

The vast majority of its population remained active in agriculture  even those people living within the city itself  But a small segment of the urban society started to specialize in nonagricultural tasks as a result of the city s role as a regional center  Within the productive sector  there was a growth of a variety of specialist craftspeople  Early in the Uruk period  the use of undecorated utilitarian pottery was probably the result of specialized mass production  In an early fourth millennium level of the Eanna archaeological site at Uruk  a pottery style appears that is most characteristic of this process  the so called beveled rim bowl  It is a rather shallow bowl that was crudely made in a mold  hence  in only a limited number of standard sizes  For some unknown reason  many were discarded  often still intact  and thousands have been found all over the Near East  The beveled rim bowl is one of the most telling diagnostic finds for identifying an Uruk period site  Of importance is the fact that it was produced rapidly in large amounts  most likely by specialists in a central location

A variety of documentation indicates that certain goods  once made by a family member as one of many duties  were later made by skilled artisans  Certain images depict groups of people  most likely women  involved in weaving textiles  an activity we know from later third millennium texts to have been vital in the economy and to have been centrally administered  Also  a specialized metal producing workshop may have been excavated in a small area at Uruk  It contained a number of channels lined by a sequence of holes  about 50 centimeters deep  all showing burn marks and filled with ashes  This has been interpreted as the remains of a workshop where molten metal was scooped up from the channel and poured into molds in the holes  Some type of mass production by specialists were involved here

Objects themselves suggest that they were the work of skilled professionals  In the late Uruk period  3500 3100 B C E    there first appeared a type of object that remained characteristic for Mesopotamia throughout its entire history  the cylinder seal  This was a small cylinder  usually no more than 3 centimeters high and 2 centimeters in diameter  of shell  bone  faience  a glassy type of stoneware   or various types of stones  on which a scene was carved into the surface  When rolled over a soft material    primarily the clay of bullae  round seals   tablets  or clay lumps attached to boxes  jars  or door bolts    the scene would appear in relief  easily legible  The technological knowledge needed to carve it was far superior to that for stamp seals  which had happened in the early Neolithic period  approximately 10 000 5000 B C E    From the first appearance of cylinder seals  the carved scenes could be highly elaborate and refined  indicating the work of specialist stone cutters  Similarly  the late Uruk period shows the first monumental art  relief  and statuary in the round  made with a degree of mastery that only a professional could have produced
