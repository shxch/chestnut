Ghost Mural
In 1932 the well-known Mexican muralist David
Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned to paint a mural on
the second-story exterior wall of a historic building in
downtown Los Angeles. Siqueiros was asked to celebrate

the 3 centerpiece at night.
4 The reason for Siqueiros’s secrecy became clear
when the mural was 5 confided. The centerpiece of the
work was dominated by images of native people being
oppressed and 6 including an eagle symbolizing the
United States. Siqueiros’s political message did not please
the wealthy citizens who had commissioned his work.
They eventually ordered the mural to be literally
whitewashed, or painted over with white paint.
However, by the 1970s, the white paint had begun to
fade, and the bright colors of the mural were beginning to
show through. At the same time, a social and civil rights
movement for Mexican Americans was working to raise
awareness of Mexican American cultural identity. Artists
associated with 7 this began to rediscover and promote
the work of the Mexican muralists, particularly Siqueiros.
To them, “América Tropical” was an example of how art
in public spaces could be used to celebrate Mexican
American heritage while at the same time making a
political statement. Inspired by Siqueiros and the other
muralists, this new generation of artists strove to emulate
the old mural masters.

8 The result was an explosion of mural painting
that spread throughout California and the southwestern
United States in the 1970s. It was the Chicano mural
movement. Hundreds of large, colorful new murals
depicting elements of Mexican American life and history
appeared during this period, some in designated cultural
locations but many more in abandoned lots, on unused
buildings, or 9 painted on infrastructure such as
highways and bridges. Many of these murals can still be
seen today, although some have not been well
maintained.

murals, and efforts are underway to clean, restore, and
