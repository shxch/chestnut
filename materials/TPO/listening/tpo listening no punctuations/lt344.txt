Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her creative writing professor
Student
Hello  Professor Thomson  Could I talk to you for a minute
Professor
Oh  Hi  Laura  We missed you last class
Student
Yeah  I was sick for a few days  Um…I was wondering   did I miss a lot of work
Professor
Let s see…well  we discussed the story that you have been assigned to read for class  A Memory by Eudora Welty  And then we listened to a recording of an interview with Welty  The recording is on reserve at the library  You ll need to listen to it  So…did you have a chance to read the story
Student
Yeah  I did
Professor
What did you think
Student
Well…I was a little surprised  I mean  the first time I read it anyway
Professor
What surprised you


Student
You know  it just seemed like there was nothing going on in the story  I mean  a girl is just sitting at the beach thinking about one of her memories  And at the same time  she is watching other bathers on the beach  and sort of just thinking about what they are doing too  And that s all that happens  So at the end of the story  I thought  that s it
Professor
I know what you mean  There s no surprise ending like in O  Henry s story The Gift of the Magi or some big adventure like in Faulkner s The Bear
So you didn t like the story
Student
Well  actually  while I was reading it the second time  I sort of realized that you don t need surprises or excitement to have a great story    The girl s memory and the stuff she was thinking about while she was watching the other people on the beach were really interesting to read about  And you know  it made me think that when I write my story  the one we have to write for this class  I can maybe use my own memories to get me started
Professor
Well  in fact  I d hoped you d see that  Of course  there are many levels to the story  But what I really wanted the class to take away from it was that you don t need to write about the great exciting world when you write you stories  Even writing about a memory can work
Student
Like I could write about one of the times I took a walk in the woods when I was a kid
Professor
Exactly  You know  as the due day of your stories approaches  I am hearing from a lot of students that they are worried because they don t have anything exciting enough to write about  But Welty said in the interview we listened to and in her autobiography that her worst stories were the ones where she tried to write about people or places that were unfamiliar to her  That s why a lot of her stories are set in Mississippi  where she is from  Welty stressed that  for her anyway  familiarity with her subject matter was the key to a successful story
Student
Familiarity  That makes sense  Thanks Professor Thomson
Professor
No problem  Now  don t forget to listen to that recording
