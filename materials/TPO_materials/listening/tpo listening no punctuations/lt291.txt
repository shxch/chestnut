Listen to part of a conversation between a student and an employee at the registrar s office

Employee
Morning  How can I help you

Student
Well  I am kind of confused about my schedule  I printed it out this morning  But one of the classes I registered for is missing

Employee
OK  Let s see if we can figure this out  What s your name

Student
Lisa Johnson

Employee
Alright  I am bringing up your schedule on the computer  Hmmm…It looks like you re registered for Introduction to Astronomy  Survey of American Literature  and Introduction to Government and Politics

Student
Well  yes  but I also registered for a language class Level One Japanese  Did they…I don t know  maybe cancel it

Employee
I doubt it  The Japanese classes are quite popular  But let s take a look at the list of Japanese classes being offered this semester just to make sure  Um… what section did you register for

Student
I don t remember the section number  But it s the one that meets at eleven

Employee
Ah  That would be section five  Well  according to this  the class is completely full  Are you sure…you  um  you registered online  right

Student
Yeah

Employee
Did you get a confirmation message

Student
What do you mean

Employee
Well  once you ve successfully registered for a class  the computer gives you a message saying you are in

Student
Oh  You mean that message at the bottom of the screen that says you re now registered for this class  Actually  I didn t get that message  I got one that said  instructor s signature required   I thought I just needed to get to professor s signature on the first day of class

Employee
Well  you do  But the professor might no sign it  It depends on how full the class is and how many additional students the professor is willing to let in

Student
So that means I am not registered for the class  Not unless the professor signs me in  What  uh  what should I do now

Employee
Let me give you the form the professor needs to sign  Go to the class on the first day  get there early  so you can talk to the professor before class starts  Find out if he or she is willing to let you in  If so  bring the signed form back here and we ll register you for the class

If not  well  you ll have to find a different class  I d start looking for alternatives now  just in case

Student
What do you think my chances are of getting into this class

Employee
Students often add and drop classes once the semester begins  so there is a real chance a seat would open up  But of course there are no guarantees

Student
It s just that I need a language course to graduate and that s the only Japanese class that fits my schedule

Employee
Yes  But according to our records  you are only in your first year here  If you can t take the class this semester  you still got time

Student
I know  I was just hoping to take care of my requirements earlier rather than later

Employee
I understand  I just wanted to make sure you know you had options
