TPO 5 Lecture 2 Astronomy

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Astronomy Class

Professor
Last week  we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon  But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing too  um… not the least of which is trying to pinpoint the moon s age

We could do this in theory by studying an enormous impact crater  known as the South Pole Aitken Basin  Um…it s located in the moon s South Polar Region  But  since it s on the far side of the moon  it can only be seen from space

Here is an image of…we ll call it the SPA Basin  This color coated image of the SPA Basin  those aren t its actual colors obviously  this image is from the mid 90s  from the American spacecraft called Clementine  Um… unlike earlier lunar missions  Clementine didn t orbit only around the moon s equator  Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this topographical map of … well  the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South Pole  the purples and blues in the middle correspond to low elevations   the SPA Basin itself  the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations

The basin measures an amazing 2 500 km in diameter  and its average depth is 12 km  That makes it the biggest known crater in our solar system and it may well be the oldest  You know planetary researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them  how they redistributed pieces of the planet s crust  And in this case  we especially want to know if any of the mantle  the layer beneath the crust  was exposed by the impact  Not everyone agrees  but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA Basin did penetrate the Moon s mantle  And we need to find out  because much more than the crust  the mantle contains information about a planet s or Moon s total composition  And that s key to understanding planet formation  Um…Dian

Dian
So  the only way to know the basin s age is to study its rocks directly

Professor
Well  from radio survey data  we know that the basin contains lots of smaller craters  So it must be really old  about 4 billion years  give or take a few hundred million years  But that s not very precise  If we had rock samples to study  we d know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of planetary formation  or if they resulted from later meteor showers

Dian
But if we know around how old the Basin is  I m not sure that s reason enough to go to the Moon again

Professor
No…  but such crude estimates…um…we can do better than that

Besides  there s other things worth investigating  like is there water ice on the moon  Clementine s data indicated that the wall of the south polar crater was more reflective than expected  So some experts think there s probably ice there  Also  data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and by inference water less than a meter underground at both poles

Student
Well  if there s water  how did it get there  Underground rivers

Professor
We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules  Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon s poles  that water would be perpetually frozen  because the floors of those craters are always in shadow  Um…furthermore  if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust  it would be protected from evaporation

Dian
So are you saying there might be primitive life on the moon

Professor
That s not my point at all  Um… o k   say there is water ice on the moon  That would be of very practical value for a future moon base for astronauts  Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking  It could also be broken down into its component parts   oxygen and hydrogen  Oxygen could be used to breathe  and hydrogen could be turned into fuel  rocket fuel  So water ice could enable the creation of a self sustaining moon base someday  a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration

Student
But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make fuel and build a life support system for a moon base  wouldn t that be too expensive

Professor
Permanent base  maybe a ways off  but we shouldn t have to wait for that  The dust at the bottom of the SPA Basin really does have a fascinating story to tell  I wouldn t give for a few samples of it
