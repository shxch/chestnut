Listen to a conversation between a student and a library employee
Student
Excuse me  I received a letter that I am supposed to return a book that I checked out back in September   it s called Modern Social Problems  But I am writing my senior thesis  so I thought I was allowed to keep the book for the whole academic year

Librarian


So you signed up for extended borrowing privileges
Student
Yeah
Librarian
And we are still asking you to bring the book back
Student
Uh huh  Do I really have to


Librarian


Well  let me check the computer   The title was     Modern Social Problems
Student
Yeah
Librarian
Eh    Ok  yeah  It s been recalled  You can keep it all year as long as no one else requests it  but someone else has  it looks like one of the professors in the sociology department  So you have to bring it back  You can check it out again when it is returned in a couple of weeks


What if the person renews it  And I really need it right now
Librarian
All of it  Or is there a certain section or chapter you are working with


Student


Well  there s one chapter in particular I am working with  but why
Librarian
Well  we normally don t do this  but because of the circumstances we can photocopy up to one chapter for you  Why don t you do that for the one you are working with right now  And by the time you need the rest of the book  maybe it ll have been returned

Student


Oh  that would be great
Librarian
Do you have it with you
Student
Eh    no  it s in my dorm room  These are books I want to check out today  Is it OK if I bring that one by in a couple of days
Librarian
Actually  the due day is tomorrow  After that  there ll be a two dollar per day fine  But you need to return it today if you want to check out any books today  That s our policy

Student
Oh  I see
Librarian
Yeah  not a lot of people realize that  In fact  every semester we get a few students who would have their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven t returned books  They are allowed to use books only in the library  They are not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books


That s not good  I guess I should head back to the dorm right now
Librarian
But before you go  what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks  Then the person who requested it won t be able to renew it  You ll get it back quickly
Student
I ll do that right now
