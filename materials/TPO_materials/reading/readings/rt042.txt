The earliest discovered traces of art are beads and carvings  and then paintings  from sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period  We might expect that early artistic efforts would be crude  but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill  So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa  Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28 000 years ago  which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe  But painting may be even older than that  The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30 000 years ago  and maybe as much as 60 000 years ago

The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe   1  in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances   2  in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves  and  3  in the inner reaches of caves  whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical religious activities were performed there

The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals  The paintings rest on bare walls  with no backdrops or environmental trappings  Perhaps  like many contemporary peoples  Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury  and if that were indeed their belief  it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art  Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people sought to improve their luck at hunting  This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures  perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings  But if improving their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the paintings  it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared  Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals  Cave art seems to have reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period  when the herds of game were decreasing

The particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed  perhaps  by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson  The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides  For example  wild cattle  bovines  and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance  probably because they were larger and heavier  meatier  than other animals in the environment  In addition  the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size  speed  natural weapons such as tusks and horns  and the unpredictability of their behavior  That is  mammoths  bovines  and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer  Thus  the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people  Consistent with this idea  according to the investigators  is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food  But in that period  when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals  because they were becoming extinct   the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals

Upper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave paintings  Many shafts of spears and similar objects were decorated with figures of animals  The anthropologist Alexander Marshack has an interesting interpretation of some of the engravings made during the Upper Paleolithic  He believes that as far back as 30 000 B C   hunters may have used a system of notation  engraved on bone and stone  to mark phases of the Moon  If this is true  it would mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and were consciously aware of their environment  In addition to other artworks  figurines representing the human female in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper Paleolithic sites  It has been suggested that these figurines were an ideal type or an expression of a desire for fertility

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Upper Paleolithic people  like many contemporary peoples  believed that if they drew a human image in their cave art  it would cause death or injury
 Many contemporary people believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury  so they  like Upper Paleolithic people  rarely depicted human figures in their cave art
 If Upper Paleolithic people  like many contemporary peoples  believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury  this belief might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art
 Although many contemporary peoples believe that the drawing of a human image can cause death or injury  researchers cannot explain why Upper Paleolithic people rarely depicted human figures in their cave art
