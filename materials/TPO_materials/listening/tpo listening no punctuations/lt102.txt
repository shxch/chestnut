We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures  So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers  Because until recently there was no fossil record of what we call  the missing link   that is evidence of species that show the transition between land dwelling mammals and today s whales  Fortunately  some recent fossil discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer

For example  a few years back in Pakistan  they found the skull of a wolf like creature  It was about 50 million years old  Scientists had seen this wolf like creature before  but this skull was different  The ear area of the skull had characteristics seen only in aquatic mammals  specifically whales

Uh  well  then also in Pakistan they found a fossil of another creature  which we call Ambulocetus Natans  That s a mouthful  eh  The name Ambulocetus natans comes from Latin of course  and means  walking whale that swims   It clearly had four limbs that could have been used for walking  It also had a long thin tail  typical of mammals  something we don t see in today s whales  But  it also had a long skeletal structure  And that long skeletal structure suggests that it was aquatic

And very recently in Egypt  they found a skeleton of Basilosaurus  Basilosaurus was a creature that we ve already known about for over a hundred years  And it has been linked to modern whales because of its long whale like body  But this new fossil find showed a full set of leg bones  something we didn t have before  The legs were too small to be useful  They weren t even connected to its pelvis and couldn t have supported its weight  But it clearly shows Basilosaurus s evolution from land creatures  So that s a giant step in the right direction  Even better  it establishes Ambulocetus natans as a clear link between the wolf like creature and Basilosaurus

Now these discoveries don t completely solve the mystery  I mean  Ambulocetus is a mammal that shows a sort of bridge between walking on land and swimming  But it also is very different from the whales who know today  So really we are working just a few pieces of a big puzzle

Um…a related debate involved some recent DNA studies  Remember  DNA is the genetic code for any organism  And when the DNA from two different species is similar  it suggests that those two species are related  And when we compared some whale DNA with DNA from some other species  we got quite a surprise  The DNA suggests that whales are descendants of the hippopotamus  Yes  the hippopotamus  Well  it came as a bit of a shock  I mean  that a four legged land and river dweller could be the evolutionary source of a completely aquatic creature up to 25 times its size  Unfortunately this revelation about the hippopotamus apparently contradicts the fossil record  which suggests that the hippopotamus is only a very distant relative of the whale  not an ancestor  And of course as I mentioned  that whales are descended not from hippos but from that distant wolf like creatures

So we have contradictory evidence  And more research might just raise more questions and create more controversies  At any rate  we have a choice  We can believe the molecular data  the DNA  or we can believe the skeleton trail  but unfortunately  not both

Um… and there have been some other interesting findings from DNA research  For a long time  we assumed that all whales that had teeth including sperm whales and killer whales were closely related to one another  And the same for the toothless whales  like the blue whale and other baleen whales  we assumed that they be closely related  But recent DNA studies suggest that that s not the case at all  The sperm whale is actually closely related to the baleen whale  and it s only distantly related to the toothed whales  So that was a real surprise to all of us
