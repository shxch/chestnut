The longer food is kept, the more likely it is to attract insects. Even foods stored in
containers often attract bugs. To solve this problem, scientists have been working with
different odors in an attempt to find one strong enough to keep insects from going near
food. One possibility would be to use plants with strong smells, like garlic or pine, to
keep insects away. Unfortunately, however, using these smells might keep some people
away too!

A more promising repellent is citronella oil, which comes from a type of lemongrass.
An experiment was done using this oil with a certain insect, the red flour beetle.
Scientists sprayed cardboard boxes with citronella oil and noticed that the beetles did not
enter those boxes. They were much more interested in boxes that were not sprayed.

One problem with using citronella oil as a repellent, however, is that it is quite
ephemeralâ€”it simply does not last very long. After a few months it loses its smell, and
bugs no longer find it unpleasant. Scientists hope to improve citronella oil so that its
scent remains strong for a longer time. It will also be necessary to make sure that the oil
is not harmful to people, as scientists are still not sure whether it is safe to use around
food.
