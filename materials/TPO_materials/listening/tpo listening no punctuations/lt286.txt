Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class

Professor
It s every archaeologist s dream to find a lost civilization  to make some huge discovery  to find artifacts no one else has laid a hand on in millennia  You might think that this never happens any more  given all the research in archaeology that s been done  But in the late twentieth century  archaeologists discovered the remains of a sophisticated people whose settlement might have been the hub of a civilization few people even thought existed

They found this site at the edge of a desert in Turkmenistan  in central Asia  where a series of mounds rise up from the plains  Now  you might remember because we ve talked about this  archaeologists know that mounds such as these are the kinds of geological features that indicate the presence of ancient settlements  Jim

Student
Um…mounds can be different things  right  Some are burial places…

Professor
Exactly  And some are the remains of cities  The inhabitants would build houses and temples you know  what have you  And over time  those buildings would fall down or be torn down and then be built over  Over time  generations of building and rebuilding in the same area would result in a large hill the size of a city  Careful excavation and documentation of layers in a mound can reveal a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people in a settlement over many periods of occupation

Now  this particular site is called Gonur depe  What was found at Gonur depe was amazing  the ruins of a huge palace complex  the foundations of shops and houses  the remains of thick walls and towers that fortified the city  There was even an elaborate canal system and a lot of very intricate jewelry  All these findings seem to indicate that they are the remains of an ancient civilization that was every bit as advanced as other more famous civilizations of the time  Like those in Egypt  or  or China  And the site dates back to 3 000 B C E

Student
Did they trade with those other civilizations  Because if they did  wouldn t there ve been some evidence of that  You know  an artifact found in the ruins of other civilizations

Professor
That s a good question  I mentioned Jewelry  well  Jewelry have been found in Mesopotamia and at archaeological sites in modern day Pakistan  But archaeologists didn t know where it came from  Only after the site at Gonur depe was excavated were archaeologists able to identify it as coming from Gonur depe  Uh  Sheryl

Student
I wonder why nobody found this site before

Professor
Well  before the discovery of this site  it was commonly believed that central Asia had always been occupied by mostly nomadic people  So there would be no record of major settlements  A couple of small finds have been made in the area  but really  no one had looked very hard

Now  one mystery regarding this site is that archaeological records show it was inhabited for only a few centuries

Student
What happened to the people who lived there

Professor
Well  the site was close to the Murgab river  which they would have depended on for their water  And the Murgab river  which runs toward the west  is the kind of river that shifts its course over time  So one theory is that the river s course shifted toward the South  and they simply followed it and built new towns to the South

Another theory is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements  But we might never know the truth

One thing we do know is that in the decades since Gonur depe was discovered  the site has deteriorated significantly  I mean  it s been disturbed for the first time in millennia  And being exposed to the Sun and wind has taken its toll on the ancient city

So now the question is  do we partially restore and rebuild the site before the entire thing disintegrates  It will take a lot of funding to restore it and I am not sure it ll be made available  which would be a pity  Even a partly altered site can provide valuable information  which would be lost otherwise
