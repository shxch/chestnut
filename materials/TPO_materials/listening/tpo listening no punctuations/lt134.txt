Listen to a conversation between a student and the language lab manager

Student
Hi  I m not sure  but um    is this the Carter language lab

Manager
Yes  it is  How can I help you

Student
I m taking first year Spanish this semester  Our professor says we need to come here to view a series of videos  I think it is called Spanish   Working on Your Accent

Manager
Yes  we have that  Um    They are on the wall behind you

Student
OK  So  I can just take    err     Can I take the whole series home  I think there are
three of them

Manager
I guess you haven t been here before

Student
No  no I haven t

Manager
Ok  well  you have to watch the videos here  You need to sign in to reserve an open room and sign out the video you need  just start with the first one in the series  each video is half an hour long

Student
So  it is a video library  basically

Manager
Yes  but unlike the library  you can t take any videos out of the lab

Student
OK  so how long can I use a video room for

Manager
You can sign up for two hours at a time

Student
Oh  good  so I can watch more than one video when I come up here  Is the lab pretty busy all the time
Manager
Well  rooms are usually full right after dinner time  but you can sign up the day before to reserve a room if you want

Student
Err   the day before    But  I can just stop in too  to see if there s any rooms open  right

Manager
Sure  stop in any time

Student
What about copies of the videos  Is there just one copy of each in the series
I don t want to miss out if everyone comes in at once

Manager
Oh  no  we have several copies of each tape in the Spanish Accent series  We usually have multiple copies of everything for each video collection

Student
Super  So   how many rooms are there total in the lab

Manager
20  They are pretty small  So  we normally get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a video together  Actually  someone else from your class just came in and took the first Spanish video in to watch  You could probably run in there and watch it with him  Of course  you are welcome to have own room  But  sometimes students like to watch with a classmate  so they can review the material with each other afterwards  For example  if there was some content they didn t really understand

Student
I guess I prefer my own room  I concentrate better by myself and I don t want to miss anything  you know  and he s probably already started watching it

Manager
No problem  we ve got a lot of rooms open right now  When you come in  you sign your name on the list and you re assign a room number  or if you call in advance  then the attendant will tell you your room number  if you forget  just come in and take a look at the list  The videos are over there

Student
Great  thanks
