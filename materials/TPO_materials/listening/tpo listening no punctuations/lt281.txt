Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a professor


Student
I am so sorry I am late  Professor Mills  I just finished at the student medical center  I twisted my ankle playing soccer this morning  It took longer than I expected to see the doctor

Professor
That s okay  Don t worry about it  David  So let s get started  Your paper on John Dewey s political philosophy has a few issues I d like to cover  You gave a great biographical sketch in the beginning  Okay

But then as you get into his political philosophy  I don t think you ve done enough to situate his philosophy within the time period  In other words  you haven t connected Dewey s philosophy to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time

Student
So I haven t captured the most critical influences  the influences that were most significant to his political thinking

Professor
Exactly  OK  Now  look back up at the section here  where you wrote about Dewey s view of individuality  This is all good content  But you haven t presented the information in a systematic way  I really think this portion on individuality needs to come later  after your paragraphs on Dewey s intellectual influences

Student
After my revised paragraphs on what influenced them

Professor
Yes  Revised  Let me ask  Uh  When you were finished writing  did you go back and ask yourself if all of the material was relevant

Student
Well  no

Professor
I do think there are areas that can be cut  I guess what I am saying is that your paragraphs aren t really presented in a logical order  The direction of your argument isn t crystal clear  And there s some unnecessary material getting in the way

Student
OK  Sounds like I have a lot to do

Professor
And one more thing  do you have a copy of the department s document on the correct format for index  citations and references

Student
No  I mean  I look at it online when I was working on this assignment

Professor
You really should print it out  You are going to need it for every paper you write in the political science department  It looks like you are getting it mix up with another referencing system

Student
Oh  Yeah  I used something different in high school  It s so confusing switching to a new system

Professor
I know  But remember  everything needs to be consistent when it comes to referencing  It is a very important academic convention

Oh  also  I wanted to ask youâ€¦ Will you be at the political science club meeting Saturday

Student
Definitely  The topic is John Dewey

Professor
Yes  Are you interested in leading part of the discussion  Tom Hayward is looking for someone to help out  I think you ll have a lot to contribute

Student
That ll be fun  I will give him a call
