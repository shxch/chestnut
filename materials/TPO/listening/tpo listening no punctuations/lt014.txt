Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor

Professor
Hi Mathew  I m glad you could come in today  You ve been observing Mr  Grable s third grade class for your approaches to education paper  right

Student
Um  yes  I go over to Johnson Elementary School  you know  to watch Mr  Grable teach the children in class  It s been amazing  I mean  I m just learning so much from just watching him  I m so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program  I mean it s like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher

Professor
Well  I m glad to see you feel that way  Mathew  You know  that s the goal  So  I ve been reading over your observation notes and I m quite interested in what s going on  in particular with the astronomy unit he s been teaching

Student
The astronomy unit

Professor
It seems that Mr  Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary approach to teaching that we ve been talking about in class

Student
Oh  OK  yeah  so like when he was teaching them astronomy  he didn t just teach them the names of the planets  he used it as a way to teach mythology

Professor
Really  So  how did he do that

Student
Well  some of the students could already name the planets  but they didn t know that the names had any meaning   the stories behind them

Professor
So  he…

Student
He introduced Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaining  Like  you know  how like Jupiter s the biggest planet  right  and how Jupiter was the name of the king of the gods in Roman mythology  right  So since Jupiter  the planet  is the largest planet in our solar system  it s like the king of the planets  like Jupiter was the king of all the gods

Professor
Oh  Mathew  that s a great example

Student
Yeah  And each student chose a planet and then did research on it to write a report and make a presentation  They went to the library to do the research  then they made presentations about the planet they chose

Professor
So  in one science unit  in which the focus was astronomy  the students also learned about the literature of Greek and Roman mythology  used research skills in the library  wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skills

Student
Exactly  He used this one topic to teach third graders all that stuff   how to use the books in the library  to write reports  and even how to speak in public  Plus they had a great time doing it

Professor
You know  Mathew  this is just what we ve been talking about in our class  I m sure everyone can learn something from your experience  You know  Mathew  I d love for you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday

Student
Really   Um…  cause I don t really think I ll have any time to write my paper by then

Professor
Oh  you won t need to write anything new just yet  For Wednesday  use your class observation notes and explain the things we ve discussed today

Student
Ok  that sounds all right
