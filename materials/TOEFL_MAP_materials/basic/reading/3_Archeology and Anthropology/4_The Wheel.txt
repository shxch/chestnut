The Wheel 
 

One of the most important inventions in history is the wheel. It was first made more than 5,000 years ago. Since then, people have used it for myriad reasons. Mostly, they have installed it in various machines. This has made both work and transportation easier for people over the centuries. 

No one knows exactly which culture had the wheel first. The earliest proof of its existence comes from the Mesopotamian city of Ur. A tablet with a picture of a potter's wheel was found in its ruins. The tablet has been dated to around 3500 B.C. However, it seems that the wheel appeared in several cultures almost simultaneously. The majority were in the Near East and the Mediterranean region. 

After it was created, the wheel was mostly utilized for two purposes. First, people used it to make pottery. The potter's wheel enabled artisans to make better ceramics. It let potters shape clay more easily. Thus, they produced a better quality of pottery. Even today, people who make ceramics use the potter's wheel. 

The next major purpose of the wheel was for transportation. In ancient times, it was attached to both two- and four-wheeled vehicles. Most of these were simple carts. They were pulled by animals such as horses, mules, and oxen. Later, the chariot was invented. Then, the wheel became a valuable tool of war. 

Despite having the wheel, many cultures avoided using it for transportation. The main reason was a lack of smooth surfaces. Ancient roads were typically poorly made. so most people walked or rode on animals. Animals could move smoothly over rough terrain. But wheeled vehicles could not. This made using carts impractical. It was not until Roman times that roads improved. From then on, wheeled vehicles became much more common.
