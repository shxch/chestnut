Narrator
Listen to a part of lecture in a geology class

Professor
Now there are some pretty interesting caves in parts of the western United States  especially in national parks  There is one part that has over a hundred caves  including some of the largest ones in the world  One of the more interesting ones is called Lechuguilla Cave  Lechuguilla has been explored a lot in recent decades  It s a pretty exciting place I think  It was mentioned only briefly in your books  So can anyone remember what it said  Ellen

Male Student
It s the deepest limestone cave in the U S

Professor
That s right  It s one of the longest and deepest limestone caves not just in the country but in the world  Now  what else

Male Student
Well  it was formed because of sulfuric acid  right

Professor
That s it  Yeah  what happens is you have deep underground oil deposits and there are
bacteria  Here let me draw a diagram
Part of the limestone rock layer is permeated by water from below  Those curly lines are supposed to be cracks in the rock  Below the water table and rock is oil  Bacteria feed on this oil and release hydrogen sulfide gas  This gas is hydrogen sulfide  rises up and mixes with oxygen in the underground water that sits in the cracks and fissures in the limestone  And when hydrogen sulfide reacts with the oxygen in the water  the result of that is sulfuric acid  Ok  Sulfuric acid eats away at limestone very aggressively  So you get bigger cracks and then passageways being formed along the openings in the rock and it s all underground  Ah yes  Paul

Male Student
So that water    It s not flowing  right  It s still

Professor
Yes  so there s two kinds of limestone caves  In about 90 percent of them  you have water from the surface  streams  waterfall or whatever   moving water that flows through cracks found in the limestone  It s the moving water itself that wears away at the rock and makes passageways

Also  in surface water  there is a weak acid  carbonic acid  not sulfuric acid  but carbonic acid that helps dissolve the rock  With a little help from this carbonic acid  moving water forms most of the world s limestone caves  When I was researching this for a study a few years ago  I visited a couple of these typical limestone caves  and they were all very wet  you know  from streams and rivers  This flowing water
carved out the caves and the structures inside them

Male Student
But not Lechuguilla

Professor
Dry as a bone  Well  that might be a bit of an exaggeration  But it s safe to say that it s sulfuric acid and not moving water that formed Lechuguilla cave and those few other ones like it  In fact  there is no evidence that flowing water has even gone in or out of the cave  So  it s like a maze  You have passageways all around  There are wide passages  narrow ones at all different depths  like underground tunnels in the limestone  And  since they were created underground and not from flowing surface water  not all these passageways have an opening to the outside world

And    and there is other evidence that
flowing water wasn t involved in Lechuguilla  We ve said that sulfuric acid dissolves limestone  right  and forms the passageways  What else does sulfuric acid do  Paul

Male Student
Ah  leaves a chemical residue     um

FeMale Student
Gypsum  right

Professor
Yep  you ll find lots of gypsum deposited at Lechuguilla  And  as we know  gypsum is soluble in water  So if there were flowing water in the cave  it would dissolve the gypsum  This is part of what led us to the realization that Lechuguilla is in that small group of waterless caves

And Lechuguilla is pretty much dormant now  It s not really forming any more  But  there is other ones like it  for example  in Mexico  that are forming  And when cave researchers go to explore them  they see and smell  the sulfuric acid and gases of   er   phew   now  something else  think of rotten eggs  And  it s not just the smell  Explorers even need to wear special masks to protect themselves from the gases in these caves  OK  Paul

Male Student
Yeah  how about what these caves look like on the inside

Professor
Well  the formations    there is really something  There s such variety there  like nothing anywhere else in the world  some of them are elaborate looking  like decorations  And a lot of them are made of gypsum and could be up to 20 feet long  It s pretty impressive
