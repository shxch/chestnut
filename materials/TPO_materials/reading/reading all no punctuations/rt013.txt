The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a mountain slope is often a dramatic one  Within a vertical distance of just a few tens of meters  trees disappear as a life form and are replaced by low shrubs  herbs  and grasses  This rapid zone of transition is called the upper timberline or tree line  In many semiarid areas there is also a lower timberline where the forest passes into steppe or desert at its lower edge  usually because of a lack of moisture

The upper timberline  like the snow line  is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions  It ranges from sea level in the Polar Regions to 4 500 meters in the dry subtropics and 3 500 4 500 meters in the moist tropics  Timberline trees are normally evergreens  suggesting that these have some advantage over deciduous trees  those that lose their leaves  in the extreme environments of the upper timberline  There are some areas  however  where broadleaf deciduous trees form the timberline  Species of birch  for example  may occur at the timberline in parts of the Himalayas

At the upper timberline the trees begin to become twisted and deformed  This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes  which tend to attain greater heights on ridges  whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valleys  This is because middle  and upper  latitude timberlines are strongly influenced by the duration and depth of the snow cover  As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys  trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges  even though they are more exposed to high velocity winds and poor  thin soils there  In the tropics  the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less prone to dry out  they have less frost  and they have deeper soils

There is still no universally agreed on explanation for why there should be such a dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline  Various environmental factors may play a role  Too much snow  for example  can smother trees  and avalanches and snow creep can damage or destroy them  Late lying snow reduces the effective growing season to the point where seedlings cannot establish themselves  Wind velocity also increases with altitude and may cause serious stress for trees  as is made evident by the deformed shapes at high altitudes  Some scientists have proposed that the presence of increasing levels of ultraviolet light with elevation may play a role  while browsing and grazing animals like the ibex may be another contributing factor  Probably the most important environmental factor is temperature  for if the growing season is too short and temperatures are too low  tree shoots and buds cannot mature sufficiently to survive the winter months

Above the tree line there is a zone that is generally called alpine tundra  Immediately adjacent to the timberline  the tundra consists of a fairly complete cover of low lying shrubs  herbs  and grasses  while higher up the number and diversity of species decrease until there is much bare ground with occasional mosses and lichens and some prostrate cushion plants  Some plants can even survive in favorable microhabitats above the snow line  The highest plants in the world occur at around 6 100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas  At this great height  rocks  warmed by the sun  melt small snowdrifts

The most striking characteristic of the plants of the alpine zone is their low growth form  This enables them to avoid the worst rigors of high winds and permits them to make use of the higher temperatures immediately adjacent to the ground surface  In an area where low temperatures are limiting to life  the importance of the additional heat near the surface is crucial  The low growth form can also permit the plants to take advantage of the insulation provided by a winter snow cover  In the equatorial mountains the low growth form is less prevalent

3  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about both the upper and lower timberlines
 Both are treeless zones
 Both mark forest boundaries
 Both are surrounded by desert areas

4  Paragraph 2 supports which of the following statements about deciduous trees
 They cannot grow in cold climates
 They do not exist at the upper timberline
 They are less likely than evergreens to survive at the upper timberline
 They do not require as much moisture as evergreens do










5  The word  attain  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 require
 resist
 achieve
 endure

6  The word  they  in the passage refers to
 valleys
 trees
 heights
 ridges

7  The word  prone  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 adapted
 likely
 difficult
 resistant

8  According to paragraph 3  which of the following is true of trees in the middle and upper latitudes
 Tree growth is negatively affected by the snow cover in valleys
 Tree growth is greater in valleys than on ridges
 Tree growth on ridges is not affected by high velocity winds
 Tree growth lasts longer in those latitudes than it does in the tropics















9  Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  In correct choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Because of their deformed shapes at high altitudes  trees are not likely to be seriously harmed by the strong winds typical of those altitudes
 As altitude increases  the velocity of winds increase  leading to a serious decrease in the number of trees found at high altitudes
 The deformed shapes of trees at high altitudes show that wind velocity  which increase with altitude  can cause serious hardship for trees
 Increased wind velocity at high altitudes deforms the shapes of trees  and this may cause serious stress for trees
10  In paragraph 4  what is the author s main purpose in the discussion of the dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline
 To argue that none of several environment factors that are believed to contribute to that phenomenon do in fact play a role in causing it
 To argue in support of one particular explanation of that phenomenon against several competing explanations
 To explain why the primary environmental factor responsible for that phenomenon has not yet been identified
 To present several environmental factors that may contribute to a satisfactory explanation of that phenomenon



11  The word  prevalent  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 predictable
 widespread
 successful
 developed

12  According to paragraph 6  all of the following statements are true of plants in the alpine zone EXCEPT
 Because they are low  they are less exposed to strong winds
 Because they are low  the winter snow cover gives them more protection from the extreme cold
 In the equatorial mountains  they tend to be lower than in mountains elsewhere
 Their low growth form keeps them closer to the ground  where there is more heat than further up

13  Look at the four squares  █  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
This explains how  for example  alpine cushion plants have been found growing at an altitude of 6 180 meters
Where would the sentence best fit

At the timberline  whether upper or lower  there is a profound change in the growth of trees and other plants





Answer choices


 Birch is one of the few species of tree that can survive in the extreme environments of the upper timberline
 There is no agreement among scientists as to exactly why plant growth is sharply different above and below the upper timberline
 The temperature at the upper timberline is probably more important in preventing tree growth than factors such as the amount of snowfall or the force of winds
 The geographical location of an upper timberline has an impact on both the types of trees found there and their physical characteristics
 High levels of ultraviolet light most likely play a greater role in determining tree growth at the upper timberline than do grazing animals such as the ibex
 Despite being adjacent to the timberline  the alpine tundra is an area where certain kinds of low trees can endure high winds and very low temperatures
