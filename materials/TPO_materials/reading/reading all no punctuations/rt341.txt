Islamic Art and the Book
      The arts of the Islamic book  such as calligraphy and decorative drawing  developed during A D  900 to 1500  and luxury books are some of the most characteristic examples of Islamic art produced in this period  This came about from two major developments  paper became common  replacing parchment as the major medium for writing  and rounded scripts were regularized and perfected so that they replaced the angular scripts of the previous period  which because of their angularity were uneven in height  Books became major vehicles for artistic expression  and the artists who produced them  notably calligraphers and painters  enjoyed high status  and their workshops were often sponsored by princes and their courts  Before A D  900  manuscripts of the Koran  the book containing the teachings of the Islamic religion  seem to have been the most common type of book produced and decorated  but after that date a wide range of books were produced for a broad spectrum of patrons  These continued to include  of course  manuscripts of the Koran  which every Muslim wanted to read  but scientific works  histories  romances  and epic and lyric poetry were also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with beautiful illustrations  Most were made for sale on the open market  and cities boasted special souks  markets  where books were bought and sold  The mosque of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the Kutubiyya  or Booksellers  Mosque  after the adjacent market  Some of the most luxurious books were specific commissions made at the order of a particular prince and signed by the calligrapher and decorator
      Papermaking had been introduced to the Islamic lands from China in the eighth century  It has been said that Chinese papermakers were among the prisoners captured in a battle fought near Samarqand between the Chinese and the Muslims in 751  and the technique of papermaking   in which cellulose pulp extracted from any of several plants is first suspended in water  caught on a fine screen  and then dried into flexible sheets   slowly spread westward  Within fifty years  the government in Baghdad was using paper for documents  Writing in ink on paper  unlike parchment  could not easily be erased  and therefore paper had the advantage that it was difficult to alter what was written on it  Papermaking spread quickly to Egypt   and eventually to Sicily and Spain   but it was several centuries before paper supplanted parchment for copies of the Koran  probably because of the conservative nature of religious art and its practitioners  In western Islamic lands  parchment continued to be used for manuscripts of the Koran throughout this period
      The introduction of paper spurred a conceptual revolution whose consequences have barely been explored  Although paper was never as cheap as it has become today  it was far less expensive than parchment  and therefore more people could afford to buy books  Paper is thinner than parchment  so more pages could be enclosed within a single volume  At first  paper was made in relatively small sheets that were pasted together  but by the beginning of the fourteenth century  very large sheets   as much as a meter across   were available

      These large sheets meant that calligraphers and artists had more space on which to work  Paintings became more complicated  giving the artist greater opportunities to depict space or emotion  The increased availability of paper  particularly after 1250  encouraged people to develop systems of representation  such as architectural plans and drawings  This in turn allowed the easy transfer of artistic ideas and motifs over great distances from one medium to another  and in a different scale in ways that had been difficult  if not impossible  in the previous period  Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long been used for correspondence and documents alongside the formal angular scripts used for inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran  Around the year 900  Ibn Muqla  who was a secretary and vizier at the Abbasid court in Baghdad  developed a system of proportioned writing  He standardized the length of alif  the first letter of the Arabic alphabet  and then determined what the size and shape of all other letters should be  based on the alif  Eventually  six round forms of handwriting  composed of three pairs of big and little scripts known collectively as the Six Pens  became the standard repertory of every calligrapher
