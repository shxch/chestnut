Listen to a conversation between a student and a Department Secretary

Student
Hi  Miss Hendrix

Secretary
Hi Brad  how are you

Student
I m fine  except I have a question about my paycheck

Secretary
Sure  What  up

Student
Well it s already been several weeks into the semester and my paycheck was supposed to go directly into my bank account  but there haven t been any deposits

Secretary
That s odd

Student
Yea  I thought graduate teaching assistants will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester

Secretary
They are  Let s see did you complete all the forms for payroll

Student
I filled in whatever they sent me  and I returned like at the end of
August

Secretary
Hmm  well  you definitely should have been paid by now  At least two pay periods have passed since then

Student
I asked the bank and they didn t know anything  Who should I talk to about this  payroll

Secretary
I m going to contact them for you  There was a problem in processing some of the graduate student payroll paperwork   Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed  And some people s information couldn t be retrieved

Student
Oh  But why didn t anyone let me know

Secretary
I don t know how they work over there   cause they couldn t even figure out whose information was missing  And this isn t the first time  seems like something like this happens every semester

Student
So how do I find out if my information was lost

Secretary
I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you re in the system
But you re probably not

Student
Well  then  what will I need to do

Secretary
Sorry but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax
them over to the payroll office

Student
And then what… Well  what I really need to know is how long till I get some money  I m already a month behind in my bills and my tuition s due soon

Secretary
They ll get you into the system the same day they receive your paperwork
So if you do that tomorrow  you ll get paid next Friday

Student
That s a long time from now  Will that paycheck include all the money I am owed

Secretary
It should  I will double check with the payroll department

Student
And another thing  Is there any way I could get paid sooner  I have been teaching all these weeks…

Secretary
I know it s not fair but I don t think they can do anything  all the checks are computed automatically in the system  They can t just write checks

Student
But they are the ones that made a mistake  And they never told me

Woman
I understand how you feel  If I were you  I d be upset too  I ll tell you what  when I call them  I will explain the situation and ask if there is any way you could be paid sooner  But I have to tell you that based on past experiences you shouldn t count on it

Student
 Sigh  I understand thanks  I know it s  not your fault and that you re
doing everything you can

Secretary
Well  what I CAN do is make sure that your first check for the total amount that the university owes you

Student
That ll be great  Thank you  I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning and I will come by to see you then
