One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate  We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention  We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected  and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways  We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities
Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century  What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals  the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes  To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records
Over long periods of time  substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime  sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years  Generally  the layering occurs on an annual basis  hence the observed changes in the records can be dated  Information on temperature  rainfall  and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data  Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap  calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe  ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean  ice cores from Peruvian glaciers  and ice cores from eastern Antarctica  While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale  there are nonetheless some intriguing differences  which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other
What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years  Equally striking  however  is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10 000 years  the Holocene period
To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability  it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined  These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere  the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans  changes in the land surfaces  and the extent of ice and snow  Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity  solar activity  and  possibly  human activities
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate  They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability  Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records
In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself  there is the added factor of external influences  such as volcanoes and solar activity  There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate  Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations  Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries  but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades










1  According to paragraph 1  which of the following must we find out in order to determine the impact of human activities upon climate
 The major changes in climate over the past millennia
 The degree to which the climate varies naturally
 The best method for measuring climatic change
 The millennium when humans began to interfere with the climate








2  According to paragraph 2  an advantage of proxy records over instrumental records is that
 they are more reliable measures of climatic variability in the past century
 they provide more accurate measures of local temperatures
 they provide information on climate fluctuations further back in time
 they reveal information about the human impact on the climate
















3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Because physical and chemical properties of substances are unchanging  they are useful records of climate fluctuations over time
 For hundreds or thousands of years  people have been observing changes in the chemical and physical properties of substances in order to infer climate change
 Because it takes long periods of time for the climate to change  systematic changes in the properties of substances are difficult to observe
 Changes in systematically deposited substances that are affected by climate can indicate climate variations over time

 studying regional differences in temperature variations
