Westward Migration

The story of the westward movement of population in the United States is  in the main  the story of the expansion of American agriculture of the development of new areas for the raising of livestock and the cultivation of wheat  corn  tobacco  and cotton  After 1815 improved transportation enabled more and more western farmers to escape a self sufficient way of life and enter a national market economy  During periods when commodity prices were high  the rate of westward migration increased spectacularly   Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward   observed an English visitor in 1817  during the first great wave of migration  Emigration to the West reached a peak in the 1830 s  Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains  by 1840 more than a third lived there
Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers most of them farmers  some of them artisans drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East  Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this remarkable migration  The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some religious  political  or economic crisis uprooted them and drove them across the Atlantic  Many of those who experienced this sharp break thereafter lacked the ties that had bound them and their ancestors to a single place  Moreover  European society was relatively stratified  occupation and social status were inherited  In American society  however  the class structure was less rigid  some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to improve their social and economic position  As a result  many Americans were an inveterately restless  rootless  and ambitious people  Therefore  these social traits helped to produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement  In addition  there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes  material success  and better lives
The West had plenty of attractions  the alluvial river bottoms  the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands  the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their rocky  sterile land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and erosion  In 1820 under a new land law  a farm could be bought for $100  The continued proliferation of banks made it easier for those without cash to negotiate loans in paper money  Western Farmers borrowed with the confident expectation that the expanding economy would keep farm prices high  thus making it easy to repay loans when they fell due
Transportation was becoming less of a problem for those who wished to move west and for those who hand farm surpluses to send to market  Prior to 1815  western farmers who did not live on navigable waterways were connected to them only by dirt roads and mountain trails  Livestock could be driven across the mountains  but the cost of transporting bulky grains in this fashion was several times greater than their value in eastern markets  The first step toward an improvement of western transportation was the construction of turnpikes  These roads made possible a reduction in transportation costs and thus stimulated the commercialization of agriculture along   their routes
Two other developments presaged the end of the era of turnpikes and started a transportation revolution that resulted in increased regional specialization and the growth of a national market economy  First came the steamboat  although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850 s steamboats eventually superseded all other craft in the carrying of passengers and freight  Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver freight for about one tenth of what it had previously cost on hand propelled keelboats  Next came the Erie Canal  an enormous project in its day  spanning about 350 miles  After the canal went into operation  the cost per mile of transporting a ton of freight from Buffalo to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than 1 cent  Eventually  the western states diverted much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie Canal  a shorter route to eastern markets


1  What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about western farmers prior to 1815
 They had limited their crop production to wheat  corn  tobacco  and cotton
 They were able to sell their produce at high prices
 They had not been successful in raising cattle
 They did not operate in a national market economy

2  What is the purpose of the statement   Whereas in 1810 only a seventh of the American people lived west of the Appalachian Mountains  by 1840 more than a third lived there
 To illustrate that generally population shifts occur rapidly
 To correct a mistaken impression of American agriculture from 1810 to 1840
 To emphasize the range and speed with which the westward migration occurred
 To demonstrated how attractive the Appalachian Mountains were to Americans

6  According to paragraph 3  what was the significance of the land law passed in 1820

 It provided farmland at an affordable price
 It required banks to offer loans to farmers
 It enabled farmers to sell their land for a profit

7  The word  proliferation  in the passage is closest in meaning to

8  Paragraph 4 suggests that turnpikes affected farmers by

 They ceased to be used as soon as the first turnpikes were built
 They were slower and more expensive to operate than steamboats
 They were used for long distance but not for regional transportation
 They were used primarily on the Erie Canal

12  Paragraph 5 mentions that the Erie Canal led to a reduction in all of the following EXCEPT
 the length of the route that goods from the West traveled across to reach eastern markets
 the cost of transporting freight
 the price of produce from western states
 the amount of produce from western states that was shipped on rivers
