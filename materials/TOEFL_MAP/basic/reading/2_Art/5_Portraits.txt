Portraits

A portrait is a work of art that shows a person's face, head, and upper body. In the past, the rich and famous often had their portraits painted. A person would commission an artist to paint his or her picture. Another type of portrait is the self-portrait. This involves the artist painting a picture of him or herself. Artists have used different methods to make portraits as art styles change. Before photography, portraits were the only way to capture a person's image.

A portrait almost always shows its subject in a flattering way. The artist attempts to create an exact likeness of the person. Most painted portraits show the person with a neutral expression. So the person does not often smile. In some cases though, an individual may have a slight smile. The Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, is one such painting. Most portraits show a person from a slight side view rather than a full frontal view. The portrait may be of the head, the head and shoulders, or the entire upper body. Some portraits show the person sitting or standing in dramatic pose, but that is atypical.

The painting of portraits began in ancient times. They were made of dead people for their funerals. Few of these portraits have survived to the present day. During the Renaissance, portrait painting became more common. Then, artists tried to perfect the human image in the portraits they made. Centuries later, the camera led to a new style of portraits. Despite the fact that cameras were new technology, taking a photograph was cheaper than hiring an artist to paint a person's portrait. So the subjects of many photographs in the 1800s looked like they were sitting to have their portraits made. Today, painted portraits are still done. But photographic portraits are far more usual.
