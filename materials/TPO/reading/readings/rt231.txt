Urban Climates

The city is an extraordinary processor of mass and energy and has its own metabolism  A daily input of water  food  and energy of various kinds is matched by an output of sewage  solid waste  air pollutants  energy  and materials that have been transformed in some way  The quantities involved are enormous  Many aspects of this energy use affect the atmosphere of a city  particularly in the production of heat

In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun  All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air  a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated  But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter  and if a house were perfectly insulated  one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it  Therefore  even without any industrial production of heat  an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it

The burning of fuel  such as by cars  is not the only source of this increased heat  Two other factors contribute to the higher overall temperature in cities  The first is the heat capacity of the materials that constitute the city  which is typically dominated by concrete and asphalt  During the day  heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored to be released at night  But in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity because a vegetative blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground  The second factor is that radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways   1  by a continuing series of reflection among the numerous vertical surfaces that buildings present and  2  by the dust dome  the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce  Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome more easily than outgoing longwave radiation does  the latter is absorbed by the gaseous pollutants of the dome and reradiated back to the urban surface

Cities  then  are warmer than the surrounding rural areas  and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island  Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds  but they can form almost any time  The precise configuration of a heat island depends on several factors  For example  the wind can make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows  When a heat island is well developed  variations can be extreme  in winter  busy streets in cities can be 1 7â„ƒwarmer than the side streets  Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving  The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat island intensity for that region  In general  the larger the city  the greater its heat island intensity  The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout  population density  and productive activities of a metropolis

The surface atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic peculiarities  For one thing  the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special qualities of the urban surface  With much of the built up landscape impenetrable by water  even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from      rooftops  streets  and parking lots  Thus  city surfaces  as well as the air above them  tend to be drier between episodes of rain  with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation  relative humidities are usually lower  Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them  This friction tends to slow the speed of winds  making them far less efficient at dispersing pollutants  On the other hand  air turbulence increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow  Rainfall is also increased in cities  The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built up surface





1   The word  enormous  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 growing
 frightening
 very large
 strictly controlled




2  The word  surpass  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 remain below
 be higher than
 add to
 come close to

3   According to paragraph 2  how soon heat from a warmed house reaches the outside air is greatly affected by
 how well the house is heated
 how well the house is insulated
 how many adults live in the house
 how much sunshine the house receives







4  According to paragraph 3  each of the following contributes to making urban areas warmer than the surrounding countryside EXCEPT
 the fuel burned by motor vehicles
 the capacity to store heat of the materials used in building a city
 the easy flow of heat into the ground in city areas covered by vegetation
 the repeated reflection of solar radiation back and forth among buildings

5  According to paragraph 3  why do materials in the countryside have a lower heat capacity than materials in cities do
 The countryside in the Sun is the only important source of heat
 Construction materials in the city are not as good at keeping buildings warm as they are in the countryside
 In the countryside the solar heat that flows into the ground flows out again quickly
  Countryside vegetation prevents heat from being trapped in the ground

6  How is paragraph 3 organized
  It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and then provides two causes for the second factor
  It describes two causes discovered in an early analysis of the increased heat of cities
  It describes two factors that contribute to the increased heat of cities and two other factors that work against it
  It describes two well established causes of the increased heat of cities and other two whose roles are less well understood





7  The word  configuration  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  location
  history
  temperature
  shape



8  According to paragraph 4  what can explain the substantial differences in temperature between one area and other within a well developed heat island
  The overall size of the heat island that includes the two reasons
  The intensity of the heat island that includes the two areas
  Differences between the two areas in the general level of activity  including traffic
 Differences between the two areas in the insulation materials used in construction



 9  Paragraph 4 supports the idea that a city s heat island intensity would increase if
 the city went into an economic decline and lost population
 the city s economy shifted from heavy industry to health care and education
 there was an upward trend in the average age of the city s residents
 repair work on the streets slowed traffic throughout the city






10  According to paragraph 5  surfaces in the city are generally drier than surfaces in the countryside between periods of rainfall because
 in the city gentle rain is much more common than heavy rain
 high temperatures in the city speed up the process of evaporation
 in the city there are longer periods of dry weather between episodes of rain
  rainwater in the city cannot soak into most surfaces and quickly runs off

11  The word  modified  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 changed
 blocked
 increased
 weakened

12  According to paragraph 5  which of the following is a factor responsible for the greater air turbulence in urban environments
 The high speed of the winds travelling above cities
 The greater rainfall totals recorded in cities
 Attempts to reduce urban air pollution
 The effects of tall buildings on airflow


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
     Another possibility is for the heat island to be stretched along the course of major rivers  since large waterways typically have a warming effect on the air directly above them
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Cities create climatic conditions of their own through their physical structure and urban activities



Answer Choices

 The amount of heat produced in a city will be reduced when cities use the heat from cars to warm homes
 The built up landscape of the city readily becomes a heat island  with greater water runoff and special climatic conditions such as low relative humidity and increased air turbulence
 The materials from which cities are built and the effects of pollution domes help make urban areas warmer than rural areas
 Cities tend to be warmer than their surrounding areas  in part because they produce heat by burning fuel for heating  powering vehicles  and industrial production
 In most cities  the heating that results from solar radiation is intensified by carbon dioxide  a gas that is present at very high concentrations in cities  atmospheres
 During periods without rainfall  the air in cities heats up and causes winds to slow down  with the result that pollutants are not dispersed
