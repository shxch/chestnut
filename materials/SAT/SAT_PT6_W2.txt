Questions 12-22 are based on the following passage.
A Little to the Left, but Not Too Much!
Italy’s Tower of Pisa has been leaning southward
since the initial 12 stages of it’s construction over
800 years ago. 13 Indeed, if the tower’s construction had
not taken two centuries and involved significant breaks
due to war and civil unrest, which allowed the ground
beneath the tower to settle, the tower would likely have
collapsed before it was completed.

At this point, the writer is considering adding the
following sentence.
Unfortunately, the tower’s tilt has steadily
increased over the centuries, placing the
structure in danger of collapse.
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Yes, because it provides an important
restatement of the main claim in the previous
sentence.
B) Yes, because it establishes an important shift in
emphasis in the paragraph’s discussion about the
tower’s tilt.
C) No, because it interrupts the paragraph’s
discussion with irrelevant information.
D) No, because it repeats information that is already
presented in the first paragraph.

A) NO CHANGE
B) 1990, Italy’s government, closed
C) 1990 Italy’s government, closed,
D) 1990: Italy’s government closed
Luckily, the tower survived, and its tilt has made it an
Italian 14 icon, it attracts visitors from all over who flock
to Pisa to see one of the greatest architectural
15 weirdnesses in the world. 16 By the late twentieth
century, the angle of the tower’s tilt had reached an
astonishing 5.5 degrees; in 17 1990, Italy’s government
closed the tower to visitors and appointed a committee to
find a way to save it.

The committee was charged with saving the tower
without ruining its aesthetic, 18 which no one had yet
managed to achieve. The committee’s first attempt to
reduce the angle of the tower’s tilt—placing 600 tons of
iron ingots (molded pieces of metal) on the tower’s north
side to create a counterweight—was derided because the
bulky weights ruined the tower’s appearance. The
attempt at a less visible solution—sinking anchors into
the ground below the tower—almost caused the tower to
fall.

Which choice best supports the main point of the
paragraph?
A) NO CHANGE
B) although not everyone on the committee agreed
completely about what that aesthetic was.
C) which meant somehow preserving the tower’s tilt
while preventing that tilt from increasing and
toppling the tower.
D) which included the pristine white marble finish
that has come to be widely associated with the
tower’s beauty.

[1] Enter committee member John Burland, 19 he is
a geotechnical engineer from England who saved
London’s clock tower Big Ben from collapse. [2] Burland
began a years-long process of drilling out small amounts
of soil from under the tower 20 that took several years to
complete and then monitoring the tower’s resulting
movement. [3] Twice daily, Burland evaluated these
movements and made recommendations as to how much
soil should be removed in the next drilling. [4] By 2001,
almost 77 tons of soil had been removed, and the tower’s
tilt had decreased by over 1.5 degrees; the ugly iron
weights were removed, and the tower was reopened to
visitors. [5] Burland 21 advocated using soil extraction:
removing small amounts of soil from under the tower’s
north side, opposite its tilt, to enable gravity to straighten
the tower. 22
The tower’s tilt has not increased since, and the
committee is confident that the tower will be safe for
another 200 years. Burland is now working on a more
permanent solution for keeping the tower upright, but he
is adamant that the tower never be completely
straightened. In an interview with PBS’s Nova, Burland
explained that it is very important “that we don’t really
change the character of the monument. That would be
quite wrong and quite inappropriate.”
