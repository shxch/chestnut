TPO20 Lecture1 Linguistics Gricean Maxims

Narrator

Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class

Professor

Ok  the conventions or assumptions that govern conversation  these may vary from one culture to another   but basically  for people to communicate  there is a     they have to follow certain rules  Like if I am talking with you and I start saying things that are not true  if you can t tell when I am lying and when I am telling the truth  well  we are not going to have a very satisfactory conversation  are we  Why  Because it violates one of the Gricean Maxims  that s a set of rules or maxims a philosopher name H P  Grice came up with in 1970s  One of these Gricean Maxims is    well  I ve already given you a hint
Student
Oh  you just can t go around telling lies

Professor

Right  or as Grice put it   Do not say what you believe to be false   That s one of Grice s Maxims of Quality as he called it  So that s pretty obvious  But there are others just as important  Like  eh    suppose you would ask me what time it was and I replied  my sister just got married    what would you think

Student

You are not really answering my question
Professor
No  I am not  am I  There is no connection at all  which feels wrong because you generally expect to find one  So one important maxim is simply  be relevant  And using the so called Maxim of Relevance we can infer things as well  or rather the speaker can imply things and the listener can make inferences  For instance  suppose you say you would really love to have a cup of coffee right now  and I say  there s a shop around the corner    Now  what can you infer from what I said

Student

Well  the shop sells coffee for one thing

Professor

Right  and that I believe it is open now  Because if I won t implying those things  my response would not be relevant  It d have no connection with what you said before  But according to the maxim  my response should be relevant to your statement  meaning  we should assume some connection between the statement and the response  And this maxim of relevance is quite efficient to use  Even if I don t spell out all the details  you can still make some useful logical inferences  namely  the shop is open and it sells coffee  If we actually have to explain all these details  conversations would move along pretty slowly  wouldn t they

OK  then there s the maxims of manner  including things like be clear   and avoid ambiguity

And another more interesting maxims is one of the so called maxims of quantity  quantities of information  that is  It says  to give as much as is required in the situation  So suppose you asked me what I did yesterday and I say  I went to the Art Museum   You would likely infer that I saw some works of art  Suppose  though  that I did not go inside the museum  I just walked up to it then left  Then I violated the quantity maxim by not giving enough information  So you can see how important implications are to our ability to carry on a conversation

But there are times when people will violate these maxims on purpose  Let s say a boss is asked to write a letter of recommendation for a former employee seeking an engineering job  The letter he writes is quite brief  Something like  uh  Mr   X is polite and always dresses quite neatly  So what does this really mean

Student


Oh  I see  By not mentioning any important qualities related to the job  the boss is     like  implying that this is best that can be said about Mr   X that he is really not qualified

Professor


Exactly  It s a written letter not a conversation  but the principle is the same  The boss is conveying a negative impression of Mr   X without actually saying negative about him  So  by violating the maxims  we    eh    but     it can be a way to be subtle or polite  or to convey humor through sarcasm or irony

Sometimes though people will violate maxims for another purpose  to deceive  Now  can you imagine who might do such a thing

Student


Some politicians
Student
Or advertisers

Professor

Right  Anyone who may see an advantage in implying certain things that are untrue without explicitly saying something untrue  They think  hey  don t blame us if our audience happens to draw inferences that are simply not true  So next time you see an advertisement saying some product could be up to 20% more effective  think of these maxims of quantity and relevance  and ask yourself what inferences you are being led to draw  Think  more effective than what exactly  And why do they use those little phrases  could be  and  up to   These claims give us a lot less information than they seem to
