TPO 24 Lecture4 Astronomy  Shield Volcanoes on Venus
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class
Professor  Many people have been fascinated about Venus for centuries because of its thick cloud cover  this so called planet of mystery and all of that  Well  what s under those clouds  What s the surface of the planet like  Some questions about the surface are still unresolved but  but we have learned a lot about it in the past several years
First of all  let me talk about how we have been able to get past those clouds  First  there were Soviet modules2 that landed directly on the surface and sent back some images of what was around them  Second  we did some radar imaging from satellites from above  Radar can get through the clouds  So what have we learned  Yes  Karen
Student  Well  I remember reading that there s not really a lot going on  that the surface of Venus is just flat and smooth in a lot of places
Professor  Yeah  smooth in a lot of places  But that s not  um    that s not the whole picture  In other areas  you ve got canyons  ripped valleys  meteor craters  uh  lava domes  these lava formations that look like giant pancakes  And also volcanoes
Well  one of the most interesting features on the surface are in fact the shield volcanoes  Shield volcanoes formed when magma comes out of the ground in the same spot over and over again  Remember  magma is hot molten rock that s underground  and it is called lava when it reaches the surface  Uh  so the lava builds up  and hardens  and a volcano forms
Now  the lava on Venus is thin  It spreads out easily  So shield volcanoes have very gentle sloping sides  They are called shield volcanoes  because viewed from above  they kind of resemble shields  you know  like a warrior s shield
But what s particularly interesting about these volcanoes is that most of the volcanoes here on Earth are not shield volcanoes  Instead  they are other volcano types  like strata volcanoes  for example  which are a result of tectonic plate movement  Remember tectonic plates
Underneath the Earth s crust  there are a number of shifting slabs or plates that are slowly moving  And in the zones on the edges of the plates where different plates meet and interact  that s where we get most of Earth s volcanoes
On Venus  however  volcanoes are not clustered in discrete zones like they are on Earth  Instead  they are more or less randomly scattered over Venus s surface  Well  that s significant  Venus has mostly shield volcanoes  and they are randomly scattered  that indicates that Venus does not have moving tectonic plates  and that s a big difference compared to Earth  Here on Earth  moving tectonic plates are a major geological element  just crucial for the whole surface dynamic  right
So why doesn t Venus have them  Well  there are a few theories  One of them is that this has to do with the fact that Venus has no surface water that s needed to kind of lubricate the movement of the plates  you know  like oceans on Earth  Yeah  I forgot to spell that out  Uh  Venus has no surface water
Student  Wait a second  Did you say we have shield volcanoes on Earth  Can you give an example
Professor  Sure  The volcanoes in the Hawaii islands  in the Pacific Ocean are shield volcanoes  They are formed over a hot spot of magma  So while on Earth we have several types of volcanoes  on Venus there s mostly the one type  Uh  Eric
Student  Are the volcanoes on Venus still active
Professor  Well  that s an interesting question  There is still some discussion on that point  But here s what we do now  First  the level of sulfur dioxide gas above Venus s clouds shows large and very frequent fluctuations  It is quite possible that these fluctuations  the huge increase and decrease of sulfur dioxide  happening again and again  It s quite possible that this is due to volcanic eruptions  because volcanic eruptions often emit gases  If that s the case  volcanism could very well be the root cause of Venus s thick cloud cover  And also we have observed bursts of radio energy from the planet s surface  These bursts are similar to what we see when volcanoes erupt on Earth  So this too suggests ongoing volcanic activity  But although this is intriguing evidence  no one s actually observed a Venus volcano erupting yet  so we can t be positive
