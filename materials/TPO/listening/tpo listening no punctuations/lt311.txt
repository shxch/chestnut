Conversation1  Community Planning in the Colonies
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her United States History professor
Professor
So  Amanda  you ve asked a lot of questions about trade during the colonial period of the United States  Has our discussion clarified things for you
Student
Well  yeah  but now  I think writing about trade for my paper isn t going to work
Professor
Oh  so your questions about shipping routes were for your research paper
Student
Yeah  But now  I see that I probably need to come up with a new paper topic  Actually  there was one other idea I had  I have been thinking about doing something about community planning in the early British settlements in Eastern North America
Professor
Oh  OK  I am curious  Why are you interested in doing something on community planning in colonial times
Student
Well  I am much more into architecture  It s my major and I mean  planning out a town or city goes along with that  I mean  not that I don t like history…I am interested in history…really interested…But I think  you know  for a career  architecture is more for me
Professor
That s great  I ve gotten some very thought provoking papers from students whose interests go beyond history
Student
OK  But for the paper you wanted us to try to include a comparison  right
Professor
Yes  Actually  that was really the purpose of the assignment  The way the United States developed or perhaps I should say the colonies  since the land that would become the Eastern United States…uh…there were British colonies there four hundred years ago  But anyway…uh… development in the colonies differed greatly depending on geography  I am looking for papers that have ideas about something that happened one way in the Northern colonies happened a different way in the Southern colonies
Student
Is that true in terms of urban planning
Professor
Very true  Towns in the Northern colonies were centralized and compact  They provided a meeting point for exchanging goods  for participatory government  and for practicing religion  Houses would be built along the roads that led into town  And just outside the developed area  there would usually be an open area of some sort for grazing animals and also group activities  Actually  the model for planning a town in the Northern colonies was not unlike the model for the development of towns in medieval Europe  After all  the colonists had just come from Europe and the medieval period was just ended
Student
Medieval Europe  But what about the South  If I remember correctly… In the South  at least initially  they didn t build towns so much as they built trading posts
Professor
That s right  Most of the settlers in the North wanted to start a whole new life  But most of the people who came from Europe to the South just wanted to make some money and then go back  It is not surprising that some of most common buildings were storage facilities and port facilities
