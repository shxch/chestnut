Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the student activity center

Student
This is the administrative office  right

Employee
Uh huh  How can I help you

Student
Well  I am stopping by to reserve a place for my school club that meet and work  pretty much on a regular basis  Ideally  our preference would be to have our own office

Employee
Hmm…well  we are out of private offices  But we do have some semi private options still available

Student
What do you mean

Employee
Well  it s a setup where you ll have a larger workspace shared by two other clubs  In other words  each club would have its own work area within that one room

Student
Oh  Are there any divider  walls or anything

Employee
Oh  yes  There will be a couple of dividers  so there s some privacy

Student
Um  We ll work with that then  I wouldn t want to be without an office

Employee
OK  Here are the two forms you have to fill out  Why don t you do it now while I set that up through out computer system

Student
OK

Employee
So what s your club s name  And the last name of the club president

Student
Oh  it s the photography club  And it s Williams  That s me  John Williams

Employee
Hmm…that s not pulling up anything on my screen  Um…let me try something else  Uh  how about your faculty advisor s name

Student
Sarah Baker  She is in the Arts Department

Employee
Hmm…No  Strange  You know your club is just not showing up in my online records  Is this an established club

Student
No  Actually it s a brand new one

Employee
Hmm…have you completed the registration process

Student
Yeah  last week  That was my very first step

Employee
Right  Well  for my purposes  a club definitely has to be registered before I can proceed further  At the moment  however  it appears that there s no record of your club s registration

Student
Really  I thought everything was finalized last week

Employee
Well  it is surprising  Usually there s a 24 hour turnaround in our computer database  So then do you have the registration approval letter from the review committee  That would give me the verification I need

Student
Yeah  I do  I mean  well  I don t have it with me  But … I… I  uh  can get it from my dorm room  bring it back with me and submit it with those forms you need from me

Employee
Great  That ll work  And just so you are aware  there re lots of benefits to being registered

Student
Oh  yeah  I think the university will give us permission to set up a website  right  I want to get students sharing their ideas on the website  you know  establish a photography blog

Employee
Yes  You ll be able to do that  And…um…actually there s more  You ll be allowed the use of audiovisual equipment at no cost  You ll receive a club mailbox and a club email address  You ll be allowed to post your flyers and posters around the campus for publicity  And you could be eligible for funding for club events

Student
Well  we are definitely interested in hiring a professional speaker at one of our campus events at some point in the semester  And speakers almost always charge a fee  So I ll definitely follow up on that
