Dear Parents, 

We have almost arrived at the end of another school year. The last day of school is 
going to be held on Friday, May 15. All students should have their lockers cleaned out no 
later than 3:30 on that day. 

This year, we have accomplished a number of our objectives. Several of our students 
received academic awards, such as for winning the city spelling bee (Teresa Kelly), 
winning the state math competition (Rohit Apu), and winning the county essay-writing 
contest (Julie Johnston). Furthermore, our athletic teams all had winning records and 
the girlsâ€™ volleyball team, led by Coach Alice Stevens, managed to come in second place 
in the entire state. 

Let me remind you as summer begins that all returning students must do their 
summer reading, Enclosed with this letter is a list of the books from which each student 
must choose. All students have to read at least five books and write short reports on 
them during the summer. 

Allow me to close by noting that I am always willing to meet with you and to address 

any of your concerns about the school, You can feel free to swing by and chat with me 

  

  

anytime. 

Sincerely, 
Gregory Jenkins 
Principal
