What do you remember about your life before you were three  Few people can remember anything that happened to them in their early years  Adults  memories of the next few years also tend to be scanty  Most people remember only a few events usually ones that were meaningful and distinctive  such as being hospitalized or a sibling s birth
How might this inability to recall early experiences be explained  The sheer passage of time does not account for it  adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier  Another seemingly plausible explanation that infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development also is incorrect  Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year  and eleven month olds remember some events a year later  Nor does the hypothesis that infantile amnesia reflects repression or holding back of sexually charged episodes explain the phenomenon  While such repression may occur  people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either
Three other explanations seem more promising  One involves physiological changes relevant to memory  Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues throughout early childhood  and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved later  Demonstrations of infants  and toddlers  long term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier  such as reaching in the dark for objects  putting a bottle in a doll s mouth  or pulling apart two pieces of a toy  The brain s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories  but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions
A second explanation involves the influence of the social world on children s language use  Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will endure into later childhood and adulthood  Through hearing stories with a clear beginning  middle  and ending children may learn to extract the gist of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later  Consistent with this view  parents and children increasingly engage in discussions of past events when children are about three years old  However  hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger children to form enduring memories  Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long lasting verbalizable memories
A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it  Whether people can remember an event depends critically on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempt to retrieve it  The better able the person is to reconstruct the perspective from which the material was encoded  the more likely that recall will be successful
This view is supported by a variety of factors that can create mismatches between very young children s encoding and older children s and adults  retrieval efforts  The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it  Older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw  but infants would not have encoded the information verbally  General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor s office helps older individuals encode their experiences  but again  infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures
These three explanations of infantile amnesia are not mutually exclusive  indeed  they support each other  Physiological immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely enduring memories  even when they hear stories that promote such remembering in preschoolers  Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can access as adults  Conversely  improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events  Thus  all three explanations physiological maturation  hearing and producing stories about past events  and improved encoding of key aspects of events seem likely to be involved in overcoming infantile amnesia



1  What purpose does paragraph 2 serve in the larger discussion of children s inability to recall early experiences
 To argue that theories that are not substantiated by evidence should generally be considered unreliable
 To argue that the hypotheses mentioned in paragraph 2 have been more thoroughly researched than have the theories mentioned later in the passage
 To explain why some theories about infantile amnesia are wrong before presenting ones more likely to be true
 To explain why infantile amnesia is of great interest to researchers
2  The word  plausible  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 flexible
 believable
 debatable
 predictable
3  The word  phenomenon  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 exception
 repetition
 occurrence
 idea
4  All of the following theories about the inability to recall early experiences are rejected in paragraph 2 EXCEPT
 The ability to recall an event decreases as the time after the event increases
 Young children are not capable of forming memories that last for more than a short time
 People may hold back sexually meaningful memories
 Most events in childhood are too ordinary to be worth remembering




5  What does paragraph 3 suggest about long term memory in children
 Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important for the long term memory of motor activities but not verbal descriptions
 Young children may form long term memories of actions they see earlier than of things they hear or are told
 Young children have better long term recall of short verbal exchanges than of long ones
 Children s long term recall of motor activities increases when such activities are accompanied by explicit verbal descriptions





6  According to paragraph 4  what role may storytelling play in forming childhood memories
 It may encourage the physiological maturing of the brain
 It may help preschool children tell the difference between ordinary and unusual memories
 It may help preschool children retrieve memories quickly
 It may provide an ordered structure that facilitates memory retrieval






 7  The word  critically  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 fundamentally
 partially
 consistently
 subsequently


8  The word  perspective  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  system
  theory
  source
  viewpoint









9  The phrase  This view  in the passage refers to the belief that
 the ability to retrieve a memory partly depends on the similarity between the encoding and retrieving process
 the process of encoding information is less complex for adults than it is for young adults and infants
 infants and older children are equally dependent on discussion of past events for the retrieval of information
 infants encode information in the same way older children and adults do
10  According to paragraphs 5 and 6  one disadvantage very young children face in processing information is that they cannot
 process a lot of information at one time
 organize experiences according to type
 block out interruptions
 interpret the tone of adult language

11  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Incomplete physiological development may partly explain why hearing stories does not improve long term memory in infants and toddlers
 One reason why preschoolers fail to comprehend the stories they hear is that they are physiologically immature
 Given the chance to hear stories  infants and toddlers may form enduring memories despite physiological immaturity
 Physiologically mature children seem to have no difficulty remembering stories they heard as preschoolers

12  How does paragraph 7 relate to the earlier discussion of infantile amnesia
 It introduces a new theory about the causes of infantile amnesia
 It argues that particular theories discussed earlier in the passage require further research
 It explains how particular theories discussed earlier in the passage may work in combination
 It evaluates which of the theories discussed earlier is most likely to be true

There are several possible explanations why people cannot easily remember their early childhoods





Answer Choices

 Preschoolers typically do not recall events from their first year
 Frontal lobe function of the brain may need to develop before memory retrieval can occur
 Children recall physical activities more easily if they are verbalized
 The opportunity to hear chronologically narrated stories may help three year old children produce long lasting memories
 The content of a memory determines the way in which it is encoded
 The contrasting ways in which young children and adults process information may determine their relative success in remembering
