      By 1850 the United States possessed roughly 9 000 miles of railroad track  then years later it had over 30 000 miles  more than the rest of the world combined  Much of the new construction during the 1850s occurred west of the Appalachian Mountains – over 2 000 miles in the states of Ohio and Illinois alone
      The effect of the new railroad lines rippled outward through the economy  Farmers along the tracks began to specialize in crops that they could market in distant locations  With their profits they purchased manufactured goods that earlier they might have made at home  Before the railroad reached Tennessee  the state produced about 25 000 bushels  or 640 tons  of wheat  which sold for less than 50 cents a bushel  Once the railroad came  farmers in the same counties grew 400 000 bushels  over 10 000 tons  and sold their crop at a dollar a bushel
      The new railroad networks shifted the direction of western trade  In 1840 most northwestern grain was shipped south down the Mississippi River to the bustling port of New Orleans  But low water made steamboat travel hazardous in summer  and ice shut down traffic in winter  Products such as lard  tallow  and cheese quickly spoiled if stored in New Orleans  hot and humid warehouses  Increasingly  traffic from the Midwest flowed west to east  over the new rail lines  Chicago became the region s hub  linking the farms of the upper Midwest to New York and other eastern cities by more than 2 000 miles of track in 1855  Thus while the value of goods shipped by river to New Orleans continued to increase  the South s overall share of western trade dropped dramatically
      A sharp rise in demand for grain abroad also encouraged farmers in the Northeast and Midwest to become more commercially oriented  Wheat  which in 1845 commanded $1 08 a bushel in New York City  fetched $2 46 in 1855  in similar fashion the price of corn nearly doubled  Farmers responded by specializing in cash crops  borrowing to purchase more land  and investing in equipment to increase productivity
      As railroad lines fanned out from Chicago  farmers began to acquire open prairie land in Illinois and then Iowa  putting the fertile  deep black soil into production  Commercial agriculture transformed this remarkable treeless environment  To settlers accustomed to eastern woodlands  the thousands of square miles of tall grass were an awesome sight  Indian grass  Canada wild rye  and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person  Because eastern plows could not penetrate the densely tangled roots of prairie grass  the earliest settlers erected farms along the boundary separating the forest from the prairie  In 1837  however  John Deere patented a sharp cutting steel plow that sliced through the sod without soil sticking to the blade  Cyrus McCormick refined a mechanical reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same amount of labor  By the 1850s McCormick was selling 1 000 reapers a year and could not keep up with demand  while Deere turned out 10 000 plows annually
      The new commercial farming fundamentally altered the Midwestern landscape and the environment  Native Americans had grown corn in the region for years  but never in such large fields as did later settlers who became farmers  whose surpluses were shipped east  Prairie farmers also introduced new crops that were not part of the earlier ecological system  notably wheat  along with fruits and vegetables
      Native grasses were replaced by a small number of plants cultivated as commodities  Corn had the best yields  but it was primarily used to feed livestock  Because bread played a key role in the American and European diet  wheat became the major cash crop  Tame grasses replaced native grasses in pastures for making hay
      Western farmers altered the landscape by reducing the annual fires that had kept the prairie free from trees  In the absence of these fires  trees reappeared on land not in cultivation and  if undisturbed  eventually formed woodlots  The earlier unbroken landscape gave way to independent farms  each fenced off in a precise checkerboard pattern  It was an artificial ecosystem of animals  woodlots  and crops  whose large  uniform layout made western farms more efficient than the more irregular farms in the East
 
       1  According to paragraph 1  each of the following is true about railroad track in the United States EXCEPT
 In 1850 the United State had less than 10 000 miles of railroad track
 By the end of the 1850s  Ohio and Illinois contained more railroad track than any other state in the country
 Much of the railroad track built in the United States during the 1850s was located west of the Appalachian Mountain
 By 1860 there were more miles of railroad track in the United States than in any other country

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the new railroads had which of the following effects on farm communities
 Most new farms were located along the tracks
 Farmers began to grow wheat as a commercial corp
 Many farmer decided to grow a wider variety of crops
 Demand for manufactured goods increased among famers

3  The word  bustling  in the passage is closest in meaning to
         famous
         important
  growing
         busy

4  According to paragraph 3  in what way did the new rail networks change western trade
 Northwestern farmers almost completely stopped shipping goods by steamboat
 Many western goods began to be shipped east by way of Chicago rather than south to New Orleans
 Chicago largely replaced New York and other eastern cities as the final market for goods for the West
 The value of goods shipped west soon became greater than the value of goods shipped east

5  According to paragraph 3  what was a disadvantage of shipping goods from northwestern areas to New Orleans
 There was no reliable way to get goods from New Orleans to eastern cities
 The cost of shipping goods by river to New Orleans continued to increase
 Goods shipped from New Orleans  neighboring areas had a significant competitive advantage because of their lower transportation costs
 the temperatures and humidity
6  Paragraph 4 supports the idea that the price of wheat more than doubled between 1845 and 1855 because
 the price of corn nearly doubled during that same period
 demand for grain increased sharply outside the United States
 farmers in the Northeast and Midwest began to specialize in cash crops
 many farmers had borrowed heavily to purchase land and equipment for raising wheat


7  The word  transformed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 dominated
 changed
 improved
 created

8  The word  erected  in the passage is closest in meaning to
   looked for
   lived on
          preferred
          built

9  Why does author point out that  Indian grass  Canada wild rye  and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person
 To provide a reason why people from the eastern woodlands of the United States were impressed when they saw the prairie
 To identify an obstacles to the development of the railroad lines fanning out from Chicago
 To explain why the transformation of the prairies by commercial agriculture was so remarkable
 To provide evidence supporting the claim that the prairies had fertile  deep black soil

10  According to paragraph 5  the first settlers generally did not farm open prairie land because
         they could not plow it effectively with the tools that were available
  prairie land was usually very expensive to buy
         the soil along boundaries between the forest and the prairie was more fertile than the soil of the open prairie
         the railroad lines had not yet reached the open prairie when the first settlers arrived


11  The word  surpluses  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 extra goods
 commercial goods
 unprocessed goods
 transportable goods

12  According to paragraph 8  prairie farmers changed the landscape by doing all of the following EXCEPT
 Reducing annual fires
 Dividing the land into large  regularly shaped lots
 Planting trees that eventually formed woodlots
 Fencing off their farms

The huge expansion of rail lines in Midwestern United States during the 1850s had major economic and environmental effects




 

Answer Choices
  Construction of new rail lines into the Midwest had been effectively stopped by the Appalachian Mountains  but by 1850 improved construction technology had made further advances possible
  Rail lines to Chicago and on to the East made it easier to get Midwestern goods to distant markets  while growing demand encouraged crop specialization and led to higher crop prices
  Because of the growing volume of traffic coming by rail from the Northeast and Midwest  the value of goods arriving in New Orleans for shipment to markets abroad increased dramatically
 Access to rail lines combined with the development of more efficient farming equipment allowed a fertile land of the open prairies to be used for large scale commercial agriculture
 Reduction of annual prairie fires allowed trees to reappear  and native grasses were replaced by a few commercially grown plants as previously unbroken grasslands were divided into large fenced fields
 Native Americans had grown corn on the prairies for years but had not produced large surpluses because the varieties they planted had far poorer yields than those introduced by commercial farmers
