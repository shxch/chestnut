Absolutely  Let s see   I think I told you that we ask prospective reporters to turn in some outlines for possible articles

Oh  great  When can I start
Advisor
WeII  you turned in an outline on something to do with the physics department
Student
Yeah  they re trying to come up with ways to get more students to take their introductory courses

Student
OK  Uh … what about the other outline I sent in  about the proposed increase in tuition fees
Advisor
Oh  it looks like we ve got that covered
Student
So I am starting with an article about the physics department  I guess I d better get to work  Do you have any advice on how I should cover the story
Advisor
Well  Max will want to talk to you but I am sure he will tell you to find out things like why the physics department s worried about enrollment  Has the number of students been getting smaller in recent years  By how much  What kinds of plans are they considering to address this problem
Student
Right  some of those issues are already in what I proposed
Advisor
And you ll want to do some interviews  you know  what do the professors think of the plans   what do the students think    you get the idea but …
Student
But wait till I talk to Max before proceeding
Advisor
