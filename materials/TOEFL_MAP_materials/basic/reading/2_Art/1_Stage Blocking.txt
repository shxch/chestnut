Stage Blocking 

During a stage performance, the actors stand in certain places and move in certain ways. They plan all of their moves before the performance begins. This is called stage blocking. It is used for plays, operas, musicals, and ballets. It is an integral part of anything that is performed on a stage. 

Usually, the director and performers make the plan together. They decide where each person should stand or move. Stage blocking takes several factors into account. First, the audience should be able to see the actors' faces. Second, the audience needs to be able to hear the actors' voices. Third, the actors' positions must allow for the proper dramatic effect. For example, a performer's back should not be toward the audience. Doing that would make it difficult for the audience to hear the lines or to see the actor's facial expressions and gestures.
