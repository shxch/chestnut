The United States dancer Loie Fuller  1862–1928  found theatrical dance in the late nineteenth century artistically unfulfilling  She considered herself an artist rather than a mere entertainer  and she  in turn  attracted the notice of other artists
Fuller devised a type of dance that focused on the shifting play of lights and colors on the voluminous skirts or draperies she wore  which she kept in constant motion principally through movements of her arms  sometimes extended with wands concealed under her costumes  She rejected the technical virtuosity of movement in ballet  the most prestigious form of theatrical dance at that time  perhaps because her formal dance training was minimal  Although her early theatrical career had included stints as an actress  she was not primarily interested in storytelling or expressing emotions through dance  the drama of her dancing emanated from her visual effects

Although she discovered and introduced her art in the United States  she achieved her greatest glory in Paris  where she was engaged by the Folies Bergère in 1892 and soon became  La Loie   the darling of Parisian audiences  Many of her dances represented elements or natural objects Fire  the Lily  the Butterfly  and so on and thus accorded well with the fashionable Art Nouveau style  which emphasized nature imagery and fluid  sinuous lines  Her dancing also attracted the attention of French poets and painters of the period  for it appealed to their liking for mystery  their belief in art for art s sake  a nineteenth century idea that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have some moral or educational benefit  and their efforts to synthesize form and content

Fuller had scientific leanings and constantly experimented with electrical lighting  which was then in its infancy   colored gels  slide projections  and other aspects of stage technology  She invented and patented special arrangements of mirrors and concocted chemical dyes for her draperies  Her interest in color and light paralleled the research of several artists of the period  notably the painter Seurat  famed for his Pointillist technique of creating a sense of shapes and light on canvas by applying extremely small dots of color rather than by painting lines  One of Fuller s major inventions was underlighting  in which she stood on a pane of frosted glass illuminated from underneath  This was particularly effective in her Fire Dance  1895   performed to the music of Richard Wagner s  Ride of the Valkyries   The dance caught the eye of artist Henri de Toulouse Lautrec  who depicted it in a lithograph

As her technological expertise grew more sophisticated  so did the other aspects of her dances  Although she gave little thought to music in her earliest dances  she later used scores by Gluck  Beethoven  Schubert  Chopin  and Wagner  eventually graduating to Stravinsky  Fauré  Debussy  and Mussorgsky  composers who were then considered progressive  She began to address more ambitious themes in her dances such as The Sea  in which her dancers invisibly agitated a huge expanse of silk  played upon by colored lights  Always open to scientific and technological innovations  she befriended the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie upon their discovery of radium and created a Radium Dance  which simulated the phosphorescence of that element  She both appeared in films then in an early stage of development and made them herself  the hero of her fairy tale film Le Lys de la Vie  1919  was played by René Clair  later a leading French film director

At the Paris Exposition in 1900  she had her own theater  where  in addition to her own dances  she presented pantomimes by the Japanese actress Sada Yocco  She assembled an all female company at this time and established a school around 1908  but neither survived her  Although she is remembered today chiefly for her innovations in stage lighting  her activities also touched Isadora Duncan and Ruth St  Denis  two other United States dancers who were experimenting with new types of dance  She sponsored Duncan s first appearance in Europe  Her theater at the Paris Exposition was visited by St  Denis  who found new ideas about stagecraft in Fuller s work and fresh sources for her art in Sada Yocco s plays  In 1924 St  Denis paid tribute to Fuller with the duet Valse àla Loie
