Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a Student and a facilities Manager at the university

Student
Hi  I m Melanie  the one who s been calling

Manager
From the singing group  right

Student
From the choir

Manager
Right  the choir  It s nice to finally meet you in person  So  you are having problems with

Student
Noise  Like I explained on the phone we ve always had our rehearsals in the Lincoln Auditorium every day at 3 o clock and it s always worked just great  But the past few weeks with the noise  it s been a total nightmare since construction started next door on the science hall

Manager
Oh  that s right  They re building that addition for new laboratories

Student
Exactly  Anyway  ever since they started working on it  it s been so noisy we can barely hear ourselves think

Manager
Let alone sing

Student
Forget about singing  I mean  we keep the windows down and everything  but once those bulldozers get going  I mean those machines are loud  We ve already had to cut short two rehearsals and we ve got a concert in 6 weeks

Manager
Well  that s not good  I m assuming you ve tried to reschedule your rehearsals  They don t do construction work at night

Student
I ran that by the group  but there were just too many    I mean evenings are really hard  It seems like everyone in the choir already has plans and some even have classes at night

Manager
And what about the music building

Student
You know  originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building  but then we switched with the jazz ensemble  They re a much smaller group and they said the acoustics  the sound in that room  was better for them  So having us move to a bigger space like the Lincoln Auditorium seemed like a reasonable idea

Manager
But now

Student
All that noise  I don t know  I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen

Manager
Well  that wouldn t be very nice

Student
No  But it really was quite a coincidence  Anyway  now the music building s fully booked  mornings  afternoons  everything  we just need a quiet space  And it has to have a piano

Manager
A piano  Of course some of the other auditoriums have pianos  but that s not going to be
easy

Student
You think they re pretty booked up

Manager
Probably  But it can t hurt to check  What about Bradford Hall  I remember a piano in
the old Student center there

Student
At this point  we d be grateful for any quiet place

Manager
Can you    How flexible can you be on times  You said no evenings  but what if can t find something open at 3 o clock  Can you move earlier or later

Student
I wish I could say another time would be okay  but you know how it is  everybody s already got commitments for the whole semester  2 30 or 3 30 would probably be okay  but I don t think we could go much outside that

Manager
Well  check with me tomorrow morning  I should ve found something by then  It might
not be ideal

Student
As long as it s got a piano and nobody s putting up a building next door  we ll be happy
