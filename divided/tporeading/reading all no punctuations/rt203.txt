Fossil Preservation
When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death  it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are  Attack by scavengers and bacteria  chemical decay  and destruction by erosion and other geologic agencies make the odds against preservation very high  However  the chances of escaping complete destruction are vastly improved if the organism happens to have a mineralized skeleton and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by sediment  Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors  where shelled invertebrates  organisms without spines  flourish and are covered by the continuous rain of sedimentary particles  Although most fossils are found in marine sedimentary rocks  they also are found in terrestrial deposits left by streams and lakes  On occasion  animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand  trapped in ice or lava flows  or engulfed by rapid falls of volcanic ash
The term  fossil  often implies petrifaction  literally a transformation into stone  After the death of an organism  the soft tissue is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and bacteria  The empty shell of a snail or clam may be left behind  and if it is sufficiently durable and resistant to dissolution  it may remain basically unchanged for a long period of time  Indeed  unaltered shells of marine invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old  In many marine creatures  however  the skeleton is composed of a mineral variety of calcium carbonate called aragonite  Although aragonite has the same composition as the more familiar mineral known as calcite  it has a different crystal form  is relatively unstable  and in time changes to the more stable calcite
Many other processes may alter the shell of a clam or snail and enhance its chances for preservation  Water containing dissolved silica  calcium carbonate  or iron may circulate through the enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves  In such cases  the original composition of the bone or shell remains  but the fossil is made harder and more durable  This addition of a chemically precipitated substance into pore spaces is termed  permineralization
Petrifaction may also involve a simultaneous exchange of the original substance of a dead plant or animal with mineral matter of a different composition  This process is termed  replacement  because solutions have dissolved the original material and replaced it with an equal volume of the new substance  Replacement can be a marvelously precise process  so that details of shell ornamentation  tree rings in wood  and delicate structures in bone are accurately preserved
Another type of fossilization  known as carbonization  occurs when soft tissues are preserved as thin films of carbon  Leaves and tissue of soft bodied organisms such as jellyfish or worms may accumulate  become buried and compressed  and lose their volatile constituents  The carbon often remains behind as a blackened silhouette
Although it is certainly true that the possession of hard parts enhances the prospect of preservation  organisms having soft tissues and organs are also occasionally preserved  Insects and even small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees  X ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles  digestive tracts  and visual organs of a variety of marine creatures  Soft parts  including skin  hair  and viscera of ice age mammoths  have been preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil seeps
The probability that actual remains of soft tissue will be preserved is improved if the organism dies in an environment of rapid deposition and oxygen deprivation  Under such conditions  the destructive effects of bacteria are diminished  The Middle Eocene Messel Shale  from about 48 million years ago  of Germany accumulated in such an environment  The shale was deposited in an oxygen deficient lake where lethal gases sometimes bubbled up and killed animals  Their remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and were then covered by clay and silt  Among the superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with iridescent exoskeletons  hard outer coverings   frogs with skin and blood vessels intact  and even entire small mammals with preserved fur and soft tissue

 similar
4  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 When snail or clam shells are left behind  they must be empty in order to remain durable and resist dissolution
 Although snail and clam shells are durable and resist dissolving  over time they slowly begin to change
 Although the soft parts of snails or clams dissolve quickly  their hard shells resist dissolution for a long time
 Empty snail or clam shells that are strong enough not to dissolve may stay in their original state for a long time
5  Why does the author mention  aragonite  in the passage
 To emphasize that some fossils remain unaltered for millions of years
 To contrast fossil formation in organisms with soft tissue and in organisms with hard shells
 To explain that some marine organisms must undergo chemical changes in order to fossilize
 To explain why fossil shells are more likely to survive than are fossil skeletons


6  The word  enhance  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 control
 limit
 combine
 increase

7  Which of the following best explains the process of permineralization mentioned in paragraph 3
 Water containing calcium carbonate circulates through a shell and deposits sediment
 Liquid containing chemicals hardens an already existing fossil structure
 Water passes through sediment surrounding a fossil and removes its chemical content
 A chemical substance enters a fossil and changes its shape



8  The word  precise  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 complex
 quick
 exact
 reliable


9  Paragraph 5 suggests which of the following about the carbonization process
 It is completed soon after an organism dies
 It does not occur in hard shell organisms
 It sometimes allows soft tissued organisms to be preserved with all their parts
 It is a more precise process of preservation than is replacement



10  The word  prospect  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 completion
 variety
 possibility
 speed




11  According to paragraph 7  how do environments containing oxygen affect fossil preservation
 They increase the probability that soft tissued organisms will become fossils
 They lead to more bacteria production
 They slow the rate at which clay and silt are deposited
 They reduce the chance that animal remains will be preserved

12  According to the passage  all of the following assist in fossil preservation EXCEPT
 the presence of calcite in an organism s skeleton
 the presence of large open areas along an ocean floor
 the deposition of a fossil in sticky substances such as sap or tar
 the rapid burial of an organism under layers of silt

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
The remains of ancient life are amazingly well preserved in the form of fossils



Answer Choices

 Environmental characteristics like those present on ocean floors increase the likelihood that plant and animal fossils will occur
 Fossils are more likely to be preserved in shale deposits than in deposits of clay and silt
 The shells of organisms can be preserved by processes of chemical precipitation or mineral exchange
 Freezing enables the soft parts of organisms to survive longer than the hard parts
 Comparatively few fossils are found in the terrestrial deposits of streams and lakes
 Thin films of carbon may remain as an indication of soft tissue or actual tissue may be preserved if exposure to bacteria is limited
