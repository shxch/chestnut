Colonizing the Americas via the Northwest Coast


It has long been accepted that the Americas were colonized by a migration of peoples from Asia  slowly traveling across a land bridge called Beringia  now the Bering Strait between northeastern Asia and Alaska  during the last Ice Age  The first water craft theory about this migration was that around 11 000 12 000 years ago there was an ice free corridor stretching from eastern Beringia to the areas of North America south of the great northern glaciers  It was this midcontinental corridor between two massive ice sheets–the Laurentide to the east and the Cordilleran to the west–that enabled the southward migration  But belief in this ice free corridor began to crumble when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald demonstrated that some of the most important radiocarbon dates used to support the existence of an ice free corridor were incorrect  He persuasively argued that such an ice free corridor did not exist until much later  when the continental ice began its final retreat

Support is growing for the alternative theory that people using watercraft  possibly skin boats  moved southward from Beringia along the Gulf of Alaska and then southward along the Northwest coast of North America possibly as early as 16 000 years ago  This route would have enabled humans to enter southern areas of the Americas prior to the melting of the continental glaciers  Until the early 1970s  most archaeologists did not consider the coast a possible migration route into the Americas because geologists originally believed that during the last Ice Age the entire Northwest Coast was covered by glacial ice  It had been assumed that the ice extended westward from the Alaskan Canadian Mountains to the very edge of the continental shelf  the flat  submerged part of the continent that extends into the ocean  This would have created a barrier of ice extending from the Alaska Peninsula  through the Gulf of Alaska and southward along the Northwest Coast of North America to what is today the state of Washington

The most influential proponent of the coastal migration route has been Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark  He theorized that with the use of watercraft  people gradually colonized unglaciated refuges and areas along the continental shelf exposed by the lower sea level  Fladmark s hypothesis received additional support form from the fact that the greatest diversity in Native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americas  suggesting that this region has been settled the longest

More recent geologic studies documented deglaciation and the existence of ice free areas throughout major coastal areas of British Columbia  Canada  by 13 000 years ago  Research now indicates that sizable areas of   southeastern Alaska along the inner continental shelf were not covered by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age  One study suggests that except for a 250 mile coastal area between southwestern British Columbia and Washington State  the Northwest Coast of North America was largely free of ice by approximately 16 000 years ago  Vast areas along the coast may have been deglaciated beginning around 16 000 years ago  possibly providing a coastal corridor for the movement of plants  animals  and humans sometime between 13 000 and 14 000 years ago


The coastal hypothesis has gained increasing support in recent years because the remains of large land animals  such as caribou and brown bears  have been found in southeastern Alaska dating between 10 000 and 12 500 years ago  This is the time period in which most scientists formerly believed the area to be inhospitable for humans  It has been suggested that if the environment were capable of supporting breeding populations of bears  there would have been enough food resources to support humans  Fladmark and other believe that the first human colonization of America occurred by boat along the Northwest Coast during the very late Ice Age  possibly as early as 14 000 years ago  The most recent geologic evidence indicates that it may have been possible for people to colonize ice free regions along the continental shelf that were still exposed by the lower sea level between13 000 and 14 000 years ago

The coastal hypothesis suggests an economy based on marine mammal hunting  saltwater fishing  shellfish gathering  and the use of watercraft  Because of the barrier of ice to the east  the Pacific Ocean to the west  and populated areas to the north  there may have been a greater impetus for people to move in a southerly direction
 







1  According to paragraph 1  the theory that people first migrated to the Americans by way of an ice free corridor was seriously called into question by
 paleoecologist Glen MacDonald s argument that the original migration occurred much later than had previously been believed
 the demonstration that certain previously accepted radiocarbon dates were incorrect
 evidence that the continental ice began its final retreat much later than had previously been believed
 research showing that the ice free corridor was not as long lasting as had been widely assumed



2  The word  persuasively  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 aggressively
 inflexibly
 convincingly
 carefully


















3  Paragraph 2 begins by presenting a theory and then goes on to
 discuss why the theory was rapidly accepted but then rejected
 present the evidence on which the theory was based
 cite evidence that now shows that the theory is incorrect
 explain why the theory was not initially considered plausible
4  The phrase  prior to  is closest in meaning to
 before
 immediately after
 during
 in spite of
5  Paragraph 2 supports the idea that  before the 1970s  most archaeologists held which of the following views about the earliest people to reach the Americas
 They could not have sailed directly from Beringia to Alaska and then southward because  it was thought  glacial ice covered the entire coastal region
 They were not aware that the climate would continue to become milder
 They would have had no interest in migrating southward from Beringia until after the continental glaciers had begun to melt
 They lacked the navigational skills and appropriate boats needed long distance trips

6  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways to leave out essential information
 Because this region has been settled the longest  it also displays the greatest diversity in Native American languages
 Fladmark s hypothesis states that the west coast of the Americas has been settled longer than any other region
 The fact that the greatest diversity of Native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americans lends strength to Fradmark s hypothesis
 According to Fladmark  Native American languages have survived the longest along the west coast of the Americas






7  The author s purpose in paragraph 4 is to
 indicate that a number of recent geologic studies seem to provide support for the coastal hypothesis
 indicate that coastal and inland migrations may have happened simultaneously
 explain why humans may have reached America s northwest coast before animals and plants did
 show that the coastal hypothesis may explain how people first reached Alaska but it cannot explain how people reached areas like modern British Columbia and Washington State



8  The word  Vast  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Frozen
 Various
 Isolated
 Huge
 	not reachable





9  According to paragraph 5  the discovery of the remains of large land animals supports the coastal hypothesis by providing evidence that
 humans were changing their hunting techniques to adapt to coastal rather than inland environments
 animals had migrated from the inland to the coasts  an indication that a midcontinental ice free corridor was actually implausible
 humans probably would have been able to find enough resources along the coastal corridor
 the continental shelf was still exposed by lower sea levels during the period when the southward migration of people began

10  The word  inhospitable  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 not familiar
 not suitable
 	not dangerous
 not reachable

11  According to paragraph 5  the most recent geologic research provides support for a first colonization of America dating as far back as
 16 000 years ago
 14 000 years ago
 12 500 years ago
 10 000 years ago


12  The word  impetus  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 chance
 protection
 possibility
 incentive

Recent evidence favors a rival to the long standing theory that the Americas were colonized 11 000 12 000 years ago by people migrating south from Beringia along a midcontinental ice free corridor





Answer Choices

 Evidence that an ice free corridor between two ice sheets developed when the continental ice first began to melt came primarily from radiocarbon dating
 There is growing support for the theory that migration took place much earlier  by sea  following a coastal route along Alaska and down the northwest coast
 Recent geologic evidence indicates that contrary to what had been believed  substantial areas along the coast were free of ice as early as 16 000 years ago
 Research now indicates that the parts of the inner continental shelf that remained covered with ice were colonized by a variety of early human groups well adapted to living in extremely cold environments
 There is evidence suggesting that areas along the coast may have contained enough food resources between 13 000 and 14 000 years ago to have made human colonization possible
 Even though the northern part of the continent allowed for a more varied economy  several early human groups quickly moved south
