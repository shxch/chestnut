Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class

Pro  So  that is how elephants use infrasound  Now  let s talk about the other end of the acoustical spectrum  sound that is too high for humans to hear   ultrasound

Ultrasound is used by many animals that detect and some of them send out very high frequency sounds  So  what is a good example  Yes  Carol

Carol  Well  bats  since they are all blind  bats have to use sound for  you know  to keep from flying into things

Pro  That is echolocation  Echolocation is pretty self explanatory  using echoes reflected sound waves to locate things  As Carol said  bats use it for navigation and orientation  And what else  Mike

Mike  Well  finding food is always important  and I guess not becoming food for other animals

Pro  Right  on both counts  Avoiding other predators  and locating prey  typically insects that fly around at night  Now before I go on  let me just respond to something Carol was saying    this idea that bats are blind  Actually  there are some species of bats  the ones that don t use echolocation that do rely on their vision for navigation  but it is true that for many bats  their vision is too weak to count on

Ok  so quick summary of how echolocation works  The bat emits these ultrasonic pulses  very high pitch sound waves that we cannot hear  And then  they analyze the echoes  how the waves bounce back  Here  let me finish this diagram I started before class  So the bat sends out these pulses  very focused bursts of sound  and echoes bounce back  You know  I don t think I need to draw on the echoes  your reading assignment for the next class  it has a diagram that shows this very clearly

So  anyway  as I were saying  by analyzing these echoes  the bat can determine  say  if there is wall in a cave that it needs to avoid  and how far away it is  Another thing it uses ultrasound to detect is the size and shape of objects  For example  one echo they quickly identify is the one they associate with a moth  which is common prey for a bat  particularly a moth beating its wings  However  moth happened to have a major advantage over most other insects  They can detect ultrasound  this means that when a bat approaches  the moth can detect the bat s presence  So  it has time to escape to safety  or else they can just remain motionless  Since  when they stop beating their wings  they d be much harder for the bat to distinguish from  ohâ€¦ a leaf or some other object

Now  we have tended to underestimate just how sophisticated the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are  In fact  we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out  the way a sophisticated radar system can ignore echoes from stationary objects on the ground  Radar does this to remove ground clutter  information about hills or buildings that it doesn t need  But bats  we thought they were filtering out this kind of information  because they simply couldn t analyze it  But  it looks as if we were wrong  Recently there was this experiment with trees and a specific species of bats  A bat called  the lesser spear nosed bat

Now  a tree should be a huge acoustical challenge for a bat  right  I mean it s got all kinds of surfaces with different shapes and angles  So  well  the echoes from a tree are going to a mass of chaotic acoustic reflections  right  not like the echo from a moth  So  we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at simply that is a tree  Yet  it turns out that bats or at least this particular species  cannot only tell that is a tree  but can also distinguish between  say  a pine tree  and a deciduous tree  like a maple or oak tree  just by their leaves  And when I say  leaves  I mean pine needles too  Any ideas on how it would know that

Stu  Well  like with the moth  could it be their shape

Pro  You are on the right track   it is actually the echo of all the leaves as whole that matters  Now  think  a pine tree with all those little densely packed needles  Those produce a large number of faint reflections in what s    what s called a     a smooth echo  The wave form is very even  but an oak which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections  produces a jagged wave form  or what we called  a rough echo  And these bats can distinguish between the two  and not just with trees  but with any echo that comes in a smooth or rough shape
