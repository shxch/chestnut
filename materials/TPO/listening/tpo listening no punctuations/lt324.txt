Listen to a conversation between a student and an anthropology professor

Professor
So how was the field trip to the Nature Center yesterday  You are in that biology class  aren t you
Student
Yeah  I am  The trip was amazing  We took a hike through the woods and our guide pointed out all kinds of animal and plant species  She could identify every bird  every tree…I have to tell you  I was very impressed with her knowledge
Professor
I am glad to hear you enjoyed the trip
Student
Well  I am interested in getting an advanced degree in forestry after I graduate from here  So I love all this stuff And actually  yesterday s trip got me thinking about my research paper for your class
Professor
Wonderful  Tell me more
Student
So our guide was talking about how the human need for resources had shaped the environment  And I just assumed that the human impact on the environment was always destructive
Professor
Ah…but that s not necessarily true
Student
Yeah  That s what she was telling us  She said there s archaeological evidence that some prehistoric cultures relied heavily on dead wood for fuel  or…um…just cut off some of the branches of trees instead of killing the whole tree
Professor
It is so funny you mentioned that  I was just reading an article about an archaeological site in Turkey where scientists found evidence that ancient people had been harvesting the branches from pistachio and almond trees The above text is a transcript of this conversation prepared by lady&bird  QQ519626928   Of course  when you prune these trees  cutting off just the branches like that  you are actually encouraging more growth  And you end up with a bigger crop of nuts  So this was a pretty smart strategy for collecting wood
Student
See  that s what I d like to write about  I want to look at ancient methods of wood harvesting that didn t result in the destruction of the whole forest
Professor
Hmm…so you want to write your entire paper on wood harvesting
Student
Is…is that a problem
?

Professor
Well  it s certainly a timely topic  Researchers are investigating this now  Uh…it s just that…well…I am not sure how it fits with the assignment  Remember you are supposed to be focusing on a particular culture or region
Student
Yeah  Um…actually I was planning on writing about the wood harvesting practices of the people who lived here  You know  the Native Americans who were living in this area and what that might tell us about how they lived
Professor
OK  Well  that s a possibility  I just want to make sure you can find enough information on that topic to write a well developed paper  I d like you to get started on your research right away  Maybe even talk to that nature guide and show me what information you can find  Then we can talk about whether or not your topic will work
