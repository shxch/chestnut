The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt might be the most famous building in the world  We know exactly when it was built  Construction started in 2547 B C E   about 4500 years ago  We know who had it built  That was the pharaoh Khufu  We know who oversaw its construction the pharaoh s brother  We know so many things about it  but the funny thing is  we still don t know exactly how it was built
This picture will give you an idea of the size of the Pyramid and the size of the blocks it s made out of that  About two million stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid and they are incredibly massive  The average weight is two and a half tons
The problem that has puzzled scholars for centuries is how were these blocks lifted up the height of this massive structure and then fit into place and without the benefit of modern technology  Of course  there ve been a lot of theories over the centuries
The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus  He visited Egypt around 450 B C E   when the Pyramid was already 2000 years old  His theory was that cranes were used  much like we use cranes today to construct tall buildings  And Herodotus may have seen Egyptians using cranes made of wood  But the problem with this theory has to do with simple mechanics  A crane needs a wide and sturdy base to stand on or it will fall over  Well  as you get toward the top of the Pyramid  there s really no place for a crane to stand  The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a base  Well  so much for that theory
The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to drag a stone block up the side of the structure  Of course the ramp can t be too steep  It has to have a long gentle slope  And that s the problem  If you build a ramp with a slight slope up to the top of a Pyramid that s over 130 meters high  it would have to be almost two kilometers long  Well  the Pyramid is built on a flat area called the Giza Plateau  The Plateau is simply not big enough to accommodate a two kilometer long ramp
OK  So what now  Well  if you ve ever driven on a mountain road  you d know that it has a lot of twists and turns and bends in it  because that s how engineers keep the road from having to be too steep  So why not wrap the ramp around the Pyramid  Building the ramp around it as you go  Sounds like a pretty good idea  Except it s got a serious problem  See…one of the most remarkable things about the Great Pyramid is how accurate the proportions are  The dimensions are almost perfect  To get that perfection  the engineers must have had to measure it repeatedly during construction  And the way you d measure it is from the four corners of the base  Well  if you got a ramp spiraling up from the base of the Pyramid  those corners would be buried by that ramp during construction
Well  who says the ramp has to be on the outside of the Pyramid  And now we get to the latest idea  If the ramp were on the inside of the Pyramid  the corners at the base would be exposed  so the engineers could do their measurements while they were building
Well  an architect named Houdin has spent a few years working on making computer models of the building of the Pyramid  And what Houdin believes is that an exterior straight ramp was used to construct the bottom third of the Pyramid  this ramp would have been fairly short  It probably rose less than 50 meters  Then the rest of the Pyramid was constructed using an internal ramp that spiraled around the inside of the Pyramid
But how can we test this idea  Well  there are several ways to look inside the Pyramid
One is called microgravimetry  Microgravimetry is a technique that s used to detect voids inside a structure  You can then take the data and generate an image that shows any empty spaces in the interior  Well  in 1986  French scientists completed a microgravimetric survey of the Pyramid  And one of the images they produced showed an empty spiral shaped space inside it  The shape of that space corresponds exactly to what Houdin thought the ramp would look like  I think Herodotus would be convinced  We might very well be at the end of centuries of guessing
