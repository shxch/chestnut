A：Well  it s finally looking like spring is arriving  The last of the winter snow would be melting away in a few days  So before we close today  I thought I d mention a biological event that s a part of the transition from winter to spring  something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience  There is a small creature that lives in this area  you ve probably seen it  It s the North American wood frog  Now the wood frog s not that easy tosspot since it stays pretty to close to the ground  under leaves and things and it blends in really well with its background as you can see  But they are worth the effort because they do something very unusual  something you might not have even thought possible  OK North American wood frogs live over a very broad territory or range  They re found all over the northeastern United States and all through Canada and Alaska  even inside the Arctic Circle  No other frog is able to live that far and north  But wherever they live  once the weather starts to turn cold and the temperature starts to drop below freezing  as soon as the frog even touches an ice crystal or a bit of frozen ground  well  it begins to freeze  Yeah   yes to me  You look a little bit taken aback
B  Wait  you mean it s still alive but it freezes  solid
A  Well  almost  Ice forms in all the spaces outside the cells but never within a cell
B  But… then how does its heart beat
A  It doesn t
B  But…then how could it……
A  You are gonna do such a thing  Well  that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological response inside the frog  That first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body  so the middle part of the frog  its internal organs  its heart  lungs  liver  these start getting drier and drier while the water that s being pulled away is forming a puddle around the organs just underneath the skin  And then that puddle of water starts to freeze  OK  up to known  the frog s heart is still beating  right  Slower and slower but…and in those last few hours before it freezes  it distributes glucose  a blood sugar throughout its body  its circulatory system  sort of acts like an an antifreeze
B  A solution of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter
A  Well  you tell me  In frogs  the extra glucose makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to freeze  So the cells stay just slightly wet  enough so that they can survive the winter  Then after that  the heart stops beating altogether  So is that the same
B  I don t really know  but how long dose it stay that way
A  Well  it could be days or months  all winter in fact but umm  see the heart really doesn t need to do any pumping now because the blood is frozen too
B  I just  I guess I just don t see how it isn t  you know  clinically dead
A  Well  that s the amazing thing and how it revives is pretty amazing too  After months without a heartbeat  spring time came around again  the earth starts to warm up and suddenly one day  ping  a pulse  followed by another one  then another until maybe ten  twelve hours later  the animal is fully recovered
B  And does the thawing process have some kind of trigger as well
A  Well  we are not sure actually  the clearer thing is even though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside  its inside thaw out first  the heart and brain and everything  But somehow it all just happens that way every spring
B  But after they thaw does it affect them like their lifespan
A  Well  hmm  we really don t know a lot about how long a wood frog normally lives  probably just a few years but there is no evidence its longevity  It does have some other impacts though  In studies  we found that when it comes to reproduction  freezing diminishes the mating performance of males  After they ve been frozen and thawed of course  they don t seem quite as vocal  They move slower and they seem to have a harder time recognizing a potential mate  So if the male frog could manage not to go through this freezing cycle  he d probably have more success in mating
