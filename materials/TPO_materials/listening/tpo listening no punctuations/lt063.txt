Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class

Professor
Ok  I have an interesting plant species to discuss with you today  Uh…it s a species of a very rare tree that grows in Australia  Eidothea hardeniana  but it s better known as the Nightcap Oak

Now  it was discovered only very recently  just a few years ago  Um… it remained hidden for so long because it s so rare  There are only about 200 of them in existence  They grow in a rain forest  in a mountain rage…range in the north part of New South Wales which is uh… a state in Australia  So just 200 individual trees in all

Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is…it represents…uh…a very old type…uh…kind of tree that grew a hundred million years ago  Um  we found fossils that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree  So  it s a primitive tree  A…a living fossil you might say  It s relic from earlier times and it has survived all these years without much change  And it…it s probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved

Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about  Here s a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers  I don t know how well you can see the flowers  They re those little clusters sitting at the base of the leaves

Okay  what have we tried to find out about the tree since we ve discovered it  Hmm…or how…why is…is it so rare  It s one of the first questions  Um… how is it…um…how does it reproduce  It s another question  Um  maybe those two questions are actually related  Jim

Hmm …I don t know  But I can imagine that…for instance  seed dispersal might be a factor  I mean if the…er…you know  if the seeds cannot really disperse in the wild area  then  you know  the tree may not colonize new areas  It can t spread from the area where it s growing

Professor
Right  That s…that s actually a very good answer  Uh  of course  you might think there might not be many areas where the tree could spread into  er…because…um…well  it s very specialized in terms of the habitat  But  that s not really the case here  Um…the suitable habitat  that is  the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap Oak grows

Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you  Um…um…it produces a fruit  much like a plum  On the inci…inside there s a seed with a hard shell  It…it appears that the shell has to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to soak up water  You know  if the Nightcap Oak remains…if their seeds remain locked inside their shell  they will not germinate  Actually  the seeds…er…they don t retain the power to germinate for very long  maybe two years  So there s actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate  So the shell somehow has to be broken down before this…um…germination ability expires  And…and then there s a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well  So  given all these limitations  not many seeds that the tree produces will actually germinate  So this is a possible explanation for why the tree does not spread  It doesn t necessarily explain how it became so rare  but it explains why it doesn t increase

OK  so it seems to be the case that the species  this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading  However  it seems  though we can t be sure  that it s very good at persisting as a population  Um…we…there s some indications to suggest that the population of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last  er…you know  many hundreds of years  So it s stayed quite stable  It s not a remnant of some huge population that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some reason  It s not necessarily a species in retreat  Ok  so it cannot spread very well  but it s good at maintaining itself  It s rare  but it s not disappearing

Ok  the next thing we might want to ask about a plant like that is what chances does it have to survive into the future  Let s look at that
