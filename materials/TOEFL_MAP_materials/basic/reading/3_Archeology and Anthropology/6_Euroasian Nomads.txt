Eurasian Nomads 

Nomads are people who lack permanent homes. They travel very often. They do this to find food or places to graze their animals. Most nomads carry some sort of shelter with them. This may be something like a tent or a teepee. At one time, all humans were nomads. Gradually, most people began to settle in villages, towns, and cities. But there have been groups of nomads all throughout history. The most famous nomads lived on the vast plains of Eurasia. Tribes such as the Huns and Mongols traveled on these grasslands for centuries. 

Eurasia has the world's largest area of mostly flat grasslands. These are ideal for nomads with large herds of animals. For centuries, waves of nomads moved across these lands. They normally traveled from east to west. They went from China and Mongolia into Russia. Then, they ventured into either Europe or the Middle East. Most nomads traveled far distances because of their increasing numbers. They required more land for their animals to graze on. These nomads often came into conflict with people living in civilized areas in the West. 

One well-known tribe of nomads was the Mongols. They originated in Mongolia. They had few permanent settlements. Instead, they lived most of their lives on horseback. They hunted and tended large herds of animals. The Mongols were also fierce warriors. Genghis Khan was their most famous leader. In the thirteenth century, he led armies of Mongols across the Eurasian plains. He conquered land as far away as Europe. And he created the world's largest empire.   Genghis Khan's empire did not last long after his death though.  The nomadic Mongols were ill-suited to rule and administer such a large empire.
