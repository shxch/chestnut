Palaces

Palaces are large buildings. In the past, they were the homes of kings, queens, and high-ranking nobles. Palaces were common years ago. They were built for two main reasons: protection and prestige.

In ancient times, palaces had walls around them. Soldiers with weapons manned the walls. They protected the palace and its occupants. Enemies often attacked the palaces. In many cases, the soldiers and walls kept the palaces safe.

More modern palaces lack walls. They were built for prestige purposes. They show off the wealth of the rulers. The Palace of Versailles in France is one such palace. It is one of the most opulent palaces in the world. In Russia, the rulers copied the French style. They built many extensive palaces in the St. Petersburg area. Today, most palaces are no longer the homes of rulers. They museums, art galleries, or seats of government.
