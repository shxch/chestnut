A  Today we ll continue our examination of ancient Roman sculpture  We ve already looked at portrait sculpture which are busts created to commemorate people who had died  and we ve looked at relief sculpture  or sculpting on walls  And today we ll look at yet another category of sculpture made copies of famous Greek sculptures
B  Why did they do that
A  Well no one knows for sure  You see  in the late 4th century B C   the Romans began a campaign to expand the Roman Empire  and in 300 years they had conquered most of the Mediterranean area and parts of Europe  You know the saying  copies  Roman sculptors often  To the victor belong the spoils   Well  the Roman army returned to Rome with many works of Greek art  It s probably fair to say that the Romans were impressed be Greek art and culture and they began making copies of the Greek statues  Now the dominant view in traditional art his that Roman artists lacked creativity and skill especially compared to the Greek artists who came before them  Essentially  the traditional view  a view that s been prevalent for over 250 years  is that the Romans copied Greek sculptures because they couldn t create sculpture of their own  But finally some contemporary art historians have challenged this view  One is Elaine Gazda   Gazda says that there might be other reasons that Romans made copies  She wasn t convinced that it was because of a lack of creativity  Can anyone think of another possible reason  Well maybe they just admired these sculptures  You know  they liked the way they looked  Yes  That s one of Gazda s points  Another is that while nowadays reproduction is easy  it was not so easy in Roman times  Copying statues required a lot of skill  time and effort  So Gazda hypothesizes that copying didn t indicate a lack of artistic imagination or skill on the part of Roman artists  but rather the Romans made copies because they admired Greek sculpture  Classical Greek statues represented an idealization of the human body and were considered quite beautiful at the time  Gazda also believes that it s been a mistake to dismiss the Roman copies as  well  copies for copy s sake and not to consider the Roman function and meaning of the statues
B  What do you mean the Roman function  Weren t they just for decoration
A  Well  not necessarily  Under the Emperor Augustus at the height of the Roman Empire  portrait statues were sent throughout the empire  They were supposed to communicate specific ideas about the emperor and the imperial family and to help inhabitants of the conquered areas become familiar with the Roman coins were also distributed throughout the empire  Anybody care to guess what was on them
 The emperor s face  That s right  The coins were easy to distribute and they allowed people to see the emperor or at least his likes and served as an additional reminder to let them know  well  who was in charge  And the images helped people become familiar with the emperor  Statues of him in different roles were sent all over the empire  Now  actually some Roman sculptures were original but others were exact copies of Greek statues and some Roman sculptures were combinations of some sort  Some combined more than one Greek statue and others combined a Greek god or an athlete with a Roman s head  At the time of Julius Caesar  I wasn t uncommon to create statues that had the body of a god and the head of an emperor  And the Romans were clever  What they did was they made plaster casts from molds of the sculptures  Then they shipped these plaster casts to workshops all over the empire  where they were replicated in marble or bronze  And on some statues the heads were removable  They could put an emperor s head on different bodies  showing him doing different things  And then later when then time came they could even use the head of the next emperor on the same body
