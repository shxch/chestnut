Running Water on Mars

Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water once existed in great quantity on the surface of Mars  Two types of flow features are seen  runoff channels and outflow channels  Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands  These flow features are extensive systems sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length of interconnecting  twisting channels that seem to merge into larger  wider channels  They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth  and geologists think that they are dried up beds of long gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys  Runoff channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago  the age of the Martian highlands   when the atmosphere was thicker  the surface warmer  and liquid water widespread

Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago  They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks  Instead  they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains  The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop shaped  islands  resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide  that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels  Judging from the width and depth of the channels  the flow rates must have been truly enormous perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon River  Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago  about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed

Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers  lakes  and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface  A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta a fan shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water  in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands  Other researchers go even further  suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface  A computer generated view of the Martian North Polar Region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands  The Hellas Basin  which measures some 3 000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin s rim  is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea

These ideas remain controversial  Proponents point to features such as the terraced  beaches  shown in one image  which could conceivably have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded  But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity  perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south  in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water  Furthermore  Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean  Their absence supports the picture of a cold  dry Mars that never experienced the extended mild period required to form lakes and oceans  However  more recent data imply that at least some parts of the planet did in fact experience long periods in the past during which liquid water existed on the surface

Aside from some small scale gullies  channels  found since 2000  which are inconclusive  astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today  and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny  Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans  the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past  Where did all the water go  The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface  with more contained in the planet s polar caps

5  In paragraph 2  why does the author include the information that 105 tons of water flow through the Amazon River per second
 To emphasize the great size of the volume of water that seems to have flowed through Mars  outflow channels
 To indicate data used by scientists to estimate how long ago Mars  outflow channels were formed
 To argue that flash floods on Mars may have been powerful enough to cause tear shaped  islands  to form
 To argue that the force of flood waters on Mars was powerful enough to shape the northern volcanic plains


6  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are true of the outflow channels on Mars EXCEPT
 They formed at around the same time that volcanic activity was occurring on the northern plains
 They are found only on certain parts of the Martian surface
 They sometimes empty onto what appear to have once been the wet sands of tidal beaches
 They are thought to have carried water northward from the equatorial regions






7  All of the following questions about geological features on Mars are answered in paragraph 3 EXCEPT
 What are some regions of Mars that may have once been covered with an ocean
 Where do mission scientists believe that the river forming the delta emptied
 Approximately how many craters on Mars do mission scientists believe may once have been lakes filled with water
 During what period of Mars  history do some scientists think it may have had large bodies of water
8  According to paragraph 3  images of Mars  surface have been interpreted as support for the idea that
 the polar regions of Mars were once more extensive than they are now
 a large part of the northern lowlands may once have been under water
 deltas were once a common feature of the Martian landscape
 the shape of the Hellas Basin has changed considerably over time

9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 But detractors argue that geological activity may be responsible for the water associated with the terraces
 But detractors argue that the terraces may have been formed by geological activity rather than by the presence of water
 But detractors argue that the terraces may be related to geological forces in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars  rather than to Martian water in the south
 But detractors argue that geological forces depressed the Northern Hemisphere so far below the level of the south that the terraces could not have been formed by water
10  According to paragraph 4  what do the 2003 Global Surveyor data suggest about Mars
 Ancient oceans on Mars contained only small amounts of carbon
 The climate of Mars may not have been suitable for the formation of large bodies of water
 Liquid water may have existed on some parts of Mars  surface for long periods of time
 The ancient oceans that formed on Mars dried up during periods of cold  dry weather

There is much debate concerning whether Mars once had water





Answer choices

 Mars  runoff and outflow channels are large scale  distinctive features that suggest that large quantities of liquid water once flowed on Mars
 Although some researchers claim that Mars may once have had oceans  others dispute this  pointing to an absence of evidence or offering alternative interpretations of evidence
 Various types of images have been used to demonstrate that most of Martian surface contains evidence of flowing water
 The runoff and outflow channels of Mars apparently carried a higher volume of water and formed more extensive networks than do Earth s river systems
 There is very little evidence of liquid water on Mars today  and it is assumed that all the water that once existed on the planet is frozen beneath its surface
 While numerous gullies have been discovered on Mars since 2000  many astronomers dismiss them as evidence that Mars once had liquid water
