Seventeenth Century European Economic Growth
In the late sixteenth century and into the seventeenth  Europe continued the growth that had lifted it out of the relatively less prosperous medieval period  from the mid 400s to the late 1400s   Among the key factors behind this growth were increased agricultural productivity and an expansion of trade
Populations cannot grow unless the rural economy can produce enough additional food to feed more people  During the sixteenth century  farmers brought more land into cultivation at the expense of forests and fens  low lying wetlands   Dutch land reclamation in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most spectacular example of the expansion of farmland  the Dutch reclaimed more than 36 000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone
Much of the potential for European economic development lay in what at first glance would seem to have been only sleepy villages  Such villages  however  generally lay in regions of relatively advanced agricultural production  permitting not only the survival of peasants but also the accumulation of an agricultural surplus for investment  They had access to urban merchants  markets  and trade routes
Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated rural industry  an intrinsic part of the expansion of industry  Woolens and textile manufacturers  in particular  utilized rural cottage  in home  production  which took advantage of cheap and plentiful rural labor  In the German states  the ravages of the Thirty Years  War  1618 1648  further moved textile production into the countryside  Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an attempt to supplement meager family income
More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe s economy in this period  English and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal  Population growth generated an expansion of small scale manufacturing  particularly of handicrafts  textiles  and metal production in England  Flanders  parts of northern Italy  the southwestern German states  and parts of Spain  Only iron smelting and mining required marshaling a significant amount of capital  wealth invested to create more wealth
The development of banking and other financial services contributed to the expansion of trade  By the middle of the sixteenth century  financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of exchange in place of gold or silver for other goods  Bills of exchange  which had their origins in medieval Italy  were promissory notes  written promises to pay a specified amount of money by a certain date  that could be sold to third parties  In this way  they provided credit  At mid century  an Antwerp financier only slightly exaggerated when he claimed   0ne can no more trade without bills of exchange than sail without water   Merchants no longer had to carry gold and silver over long  dangerous journeys  An Amsterdam merchant purchasing soap from a merchant in Marseille could go to an exchanger and pay the exchanger the equivalent sum in guilders  the Dutch currency  The exchanger would then send a bill of exchange to a colleague in Marseille  authorizing the colleague to pay the Marseille merchant in the merchant s own currency after the actual exchange of goods had taken place
Bills of exchange contributed to the development of banks  as exchangers began to provide loans  Not until the   eighteenth century  however  did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment  Their principal function was to provide funds for the state
The rapid expansion in international trade also benefitted from an infusion of capital  stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas  This capital financed the production of goods  storage  trade  and even credit across Europe and overseas  Moreover an increased credit supply was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint stock partnerships an English innovation  the first major company began in 1600   Unlike short term financial cooperation between investors for a single commercial undertaking  joint stock companies provided permanent funding of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the company

In late sixteenth and early seventeenth century Europe  increased agricultural production and the expansion of trade were important in economic growth













Answer choices

 Bringing more land under cultivation produced enough food to create surpluses for trade and investment as well as for supporting the larger populations that led to the growth of rural industry
 Most rural villages established an arrangement with a nearby urban center that enabled villagers to take advantage of urban markets to sell any handicrafts they produced
 Increases in population and the expansion of trade led to increased manufacturing  much of it small scale in character but some requiring significant capital investment
 Increased capital was required for the production of goods  for storage  for trade  and for the provision of credit throughout of Europe as well as distant markets overseas
 Bills of exchange were invented in medieval Italy but became less important as banks began to provide loans for merchants
 The expansion of trade was facilitated by developments in banking and financial services and benefitted from the huge influx of capital in the form of gold silver from the Americas
