Competition
When several individuals of the same species or of several different species depend on the same limited resource  a situation may arise that is referred to as competition  The existence of competition has been long known to naturalists  its effects were described by Darwin in considerable detail  Competition among individuals of the same species  intraspecies competition   one of the major mechanisms of natural selection  is the concern of evolutionary biology  Competition among the individuals of different species  interspecies competition  is a major concern of ecology  It is one of the factors controlling the size of competing populations  and extreme cases it may lead to the extinction of one of the competing species  This was described by Darwin for indigenous New Zealand species of animals and plants  which died out when competing species from Europe were introduced
No serious competition exists when the major needed resource is in superabundant supply  as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores  plant eaters   Furthermore  most species do not depend entirely on a single resource  if the major resource for a species becomes scarce  the species can usually shift to alternative resources  If more than one species is competing for a scarce resource  the competing species usually switch to different alternative resources  Competition is usually most severe among close relatives with similar demands on the environment  But it may also occur among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource  such as seed eating rodents and ants  The effects of such competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition  as happened 2 million years ago at the end of Pliocene  when North and South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama  North and South American species migrating across the Isthmus now came into competition with each other  The result was the extermination of a large fraction of the South American mammals  which were apparently unable to withstand the competition from invading North American species    although added predation was also an important factor
To what extent competition determines the composition of a community and the density of particular species has been the source of considerable controversy  The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the spread or increase of one species and the concurrent reduction or disappearance of another species  The Russian biologist G  F  Gause performed numerous tow species experiments in the laboratory  in which one of the species became extinct when only a single kind of resource was available  On the basis of these experiments and of field observations  the so called law of competitive exclusion was formulated  according to which no two species can occupy the same niche  Numerous seeming exceptions to this law have since been found  but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two species  even though competing for a major joint resource  did not really occupy exactly the same niche
Competition among species is of considerable evolutionary importance  The physical structure of species competing for resources in the same ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways that allow them to occupy different niches  Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap  The evolutionary effect of competition on species has been referred to as  species selection   however  this description is potentially misleading  Only the individuals of a species are subject to the pressures of natural selection  The effect on the well being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species  Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection
Competition may occur for any needed resource  In the case of animals it is usually food  in the case of forest plants it may be light  in the case of substrate inhabitants it may be space  as in many shallow water bottom dwelling marine organisms  Indeed  it may be for any of the factors  physical as well as biotic  that are essential for organisms  Competition is usually the more severe the denser the population  Together with predation  it is the most important density dependent factor in regulating population growth



1  The phrase  mechanisms of natural selection  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  types of natural selection
  dangers of natural selection
  problems natural selection solves
  ways natural selection works

2  According to paragraph 1  what is one effect of competition among individuals of different species
  It results in the eventual elimination of the resource for which they are competing
  It leads to competition among individuals of the same species
  It encourages new species to immigrate to an area
  It controls the number of individuals in the competing populations

3  The word  indigenous  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  native
  rate
  most
  numerous

4  In paragraph 1  why does the author mention what happened in New Zealand
  To indicate that Darwin understood the importance of competition
  To illustrate that competition can lead to the extinction of species
  To identify where the idea of competition among species first arose
  To argue against the idea that the process of selection is a natural occurrence


















5  According to paragraph 2  competition is not usually a significant factor among two coexisting species when
  one of the species has only recently moved into the territory of the other
  the species are closely related to each other
  the population of one species is much larger than that of the other
  both of the species are herbivores


6  The word  graphically  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  vividly
  frequently
  broadly
  typically


7  In paragraph 2  why does the author talk about what happened as a result of North and South America becoming joined at the Isthmus of Panama
  To make the point that predation can have as much effect on species survival as competition does
  To show how the ability to switch to an alternative resource can give a species a competitive advantage
  To account for the current species composition of North and South America
  To provide an example of the serious effects of competition between unrelated species






8  Paragraph 3 supports the idea that Gause s experiments were important because they
  provided a situation in which competition could be removed from the interaction between two species
  showed that previous ideas about the extent to which competition determines the composition of a community were completely mistaken
  helped establish that competition will remove all but one species from any given ecological niche
  offered evidence that competition between species is minimal when there is an overabundance of a single food source
9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  Apparent exceptions to this law usually involves cases in which two species compete for the same major resource but occupy slightly different niches
  Although it may appear that two species always have different niches  many exceptions show that species compete with each other
  Cases in which two species not only compete for a shared resource but also occupy similar niches are considered exceptions to this law
  Cases in which the two species do not occupy that same niche yet still compete for the same resource are believed to be exceptions to this law
10  According to paragraph 4  how does competition affect evolution
  It results in the evolution of physical structures that allow the species to compete with each other more effectively
  It results I the evolutionary extinction of all but one of the competing species
  It results in the competing species evolving in such a way that they no longer compete for the same resources
  It results in the competing species evolving to become so much like each other that competition between them eventually disappears
11  According to paragraph 4   species selection  is a misleading term because it
  overemphasizes the role of selection pressure in species extinction
  suggests that selection pressures directly influence whole species
  does not make a distinction between species extinction and species evolution
  suggests that extinction always results whenever there is a competition


12  The word  regulating  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  controlling
  explaining
  observing
  stopping

13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
That is  as the density of a population increases  competition has a greater impact and leads to greater mortality
Where would the sentence best fit

14   Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points
When necessary resources are limited  competition can occur among individuals of the same species or of different species









Answer Choices

  Competition can eliminate a species  but since most species do not depend on a single resource  competition is often reduced by switching to alternative resources
  Investigation of the ecological role of competition is difficult because ordinarily the competition cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from its presumed effects
  Competition between a pair of species tends to lessen over time because the species tend to evolve to occupy different ecological niches and ranges
  Competition between individual of the same species is usually for food whereas competition between species is usually for habitat
  Experiments and field observation have established that competition between species is strong enough to prevent two species from occupying the same ecological niche
  Competition is usually strongest when the density of the competing populations is the same
