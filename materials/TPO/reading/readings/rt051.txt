Minerals and Plants
Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants for normal growth and development  The soil is the source of these minerals  which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil  Even nitrogen  which is a gas in its elemental state  is normally absorbed from the soil as nitrate ions  Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro nutrients and are therefore unable to support most plant life  So called serpentine soils  for example  are deficient in calcium  and only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can survive  In modern agriculture  mineral depletion of soils is a major concern  since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil
Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms such as chlorosis  loss of chlorophyll resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue   necrosis  isolated dead patches   anthocyanin formation  development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or stem   stunted growth  and development of woody tissue in an herbaceous plant  Soils are most commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus  Nitrogen deficient plants exhibit many of the symptoms just described  Leaves develop chlorosis  stems are short and slender  and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems  petioles  and lower leaf surfaces  Phosphorus deficient plants are often stunted  with leaves turning a characteristic dark green  often with the accumulation of anthocyanin  Typically  older leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue  Iron deficiency is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves
Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically  that is  in soilless liquid nutrient solutions  This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants  Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research  since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter  Aeroponics  a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution  is another method for growing plants without soil
While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants  an overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth  Saline soils  which have high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts  limit plant growth  and research continues to focus on developing salt tolerant varieties of agricultural crops  Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  mercury  and aluminum  however  even copper and zinc  which are essential elements  can become toxic in high concentrations  Although most plants cannot survive in these soils  certain plants have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals
Scientists have known for some time that certain plants  called hyperaccumulators  can concentrate minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal  A survey of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel  cobalt  copper  zinc  manganese  lead  and cadmium are other minerals of choice  Hyperaccumulators run the entire range of the plant world  They may be herbs  shrubs  or trees  Many members of the mustard family  spurge family  legume family  and grass family are top hyperaccumulators  Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world  where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may afford some protection against plant eating insects and microbial pathogens
Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metalsâ€“an environmentally friendly approach known as phytoremediation  This scenario begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating species in the target area  such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff  Toxic minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem and leaves  A harvest of the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the metal for industrial uses  After several years of cultivation and harvest  the site would be restored at a cost much lower than the price of excavation and reburial  the standard practice for remediation of contaminated soils  For examples  in field trials  the plant alpine pennycress removed zinc and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter  and Indian mustard  native to Pakistan and India  has been effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils

 They are able to absorb nitrogen in its elemental state
 They are typically crops raised for food


2  The word  exhibit  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 fight off
 show
 cause
 spread

3  According to paragraph 2  which of the following symptoms occurs in phosphorus deficient plants but not in plants deficient in nitrogen or iron
 Chlorosis on leaves
 Change in leaf pigmentation to a dark shade of green
 Short  stunted appearance of stems
 Reddish pigmentation on the leaves or stem

4  According to paragraph 2  a symptom of iron deficiency is the presence in young leaves of
 deep red discoloration between the veins
 white or yellow tissue between the veins
 dead spots between the veins
 characteristic dark green veins



5  The word  facilitates  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 slows down
 affects
 makes easier
 focuses on

6  According to paragraph 3  what is the advantage of hydroponics for research on nutrient deficiencies in plants
 It allows researchers to control what nutrients a plant receives
 It allows researchers to observe the growth of a large number of plants simultaneously
 It is possible to directly observe the roots of plants
 It is unnecessary to keep misting plants with nutrient solutions

7  The word  suspended  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 grown
 protected
 spread out
 hung


8  Why does the author mention  herbs    shrubs   and  trees
 To provide examples of plant types that cannot tolerate high levels of harmful minerals
 To show why so many plants are hyperaccumulators
 To help explain why hyperaccumulators can be found in so many different places
 To emphasize that hyperaccumulators occur in a wide range of plant types

9  The word  afford  in the passage is closest in meaning to

10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Before considering phytoremediation  hyperaccumulating species of plants local to the target area must be identified
 The investigation begins with an evaluation of toxic sites in the target area to determine the extent of contamination
 The first step in phytoremediation is the planting of hyperaccumulating plants in the area to be cleaned up
 Mines and irrigation ponds can be kept from becoming contaminated by planting hyperaccumulating species in targeted areas

11  It can be inferred from paragraph 6 that compared with standard practices for remediation of contaminated soils  phytoremediation
 does not allow for the use of the removed minerals for industrial purposes
 can be faster to implement
 is equally friendly to the environment
 is less suitable for soils that need to be used within a short period of time

12  Why does the author mention  Indian mustard
 To warn about possible risks involved in phytoremediation
 To help illustrate the potential of phytoremediation
 To show that hyperaccumulating plants grow in many regions of the world
 To explain how zinc contamination can be reduced



13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Certain minerals are more likely to be accumulated in large quantities than others
Where could the sentence best fit

14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Plants need to absorb certain minerals from the soil in adequate quantities for normal growth and development







Answer Choices

 Some plants are able to accumulate extremely high levels of certain minerals and thus can be used to clean up soils contaminated with toxic levels of these minerals
 Though beneficial in lower levels  high levels of salts  other minerals  and heavy metals can be harmful to plants
 When plants do not absorb sufficient amounts of essential minerals  characteristic abnormalities result
 Because high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts limit growth in most plants  much research has been done in an effort to develop salt tolerant agricultural crops
 Some plants can tolerate comparatively low levels of certain minerals  but such plants are of little use for recycling nutrients back into depleted soils
 Mineral deficiencies in many plants can be cured by misting their roots with a nutrient solution or by transferring the plants to a soilless nutrient solution
