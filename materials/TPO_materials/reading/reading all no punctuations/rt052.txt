The Origin of the Pacific Island People
The greater Pacific region  traditionally called Oceania  consists of three cultural areas  Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia  Melanesia  in the southwest Pacific  contains the large islands of New Guinea  the Solomons  Vanuatu  and New Caledonia  Micronesia  the area north of Melanesia  consists primarily of small scattered islands  Polynesia is the central Pacific area in the great triangle defined by Hawaii  Easter Island  and New Zealand  Before the arrival of Europeans  the islands in the two largest cultural areas  Polynesia and Micronesia  together contained a population estimated at 700 000
Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them  in the absence of solid linguistic  archaeological  and biological data  many fanciful and mutually exclusive theories were devised  Pacific islanders are variously thought to have come from North America  South America  Egypt  Israel  and India  as well as Southeast Asia  Many older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and overall cultural creativity of the Pacific islanders  For example  British anthropologists G  Elliot Smith and W  J  Perry assumed that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize the Pacific  They inferred that the Egyptians even crossed the Pacific to found the great civilizations of the New World  North and South America   In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a balsa log raft westward with the winds and currents across the Pacific from South America to prove his theory that Pacific islanders were Native Americans  also called American Indians   Later Heyerdahl suggested that the Pacific was peopled by three migrations  by Native Americans from the Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii  by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island  and by Melanesians  In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian style reed boat to prove Egyptian influences in the Americas  Contrary to these theorists  the overwhelming evidence of physical anthropology  linguistics  and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came from Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the prevailing winds and currents
The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of the Pacific islands include the appropriate boat building  sailing  and navigation skills to get to the islands in the first place  domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions  and a varied inventory of fishing implements and techniques  It is now generally believed that these prerequisites originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages  a group of several hundred related languages  and began to emerge in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B C E  The culture of that time  based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction  is assumed to have had a broad inventory of cultivated plants including taro  yarns  banana  sugarcane  breadfruit  coconut  sago  and rice  Just as important  the culture also possessed the basic foundation for an effective maritime adaptation  including outrigger canoes and a variety of fishing techniques that could be effective for overseas voyaging
Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the pacific was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift  it seems reasonable that this feat was accomplished by deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and domesticated plants and animals  Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific  These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and political dynamics on the home islands  as well as the challenge and excitement of exploring unknown waters
Because all Polynesians  Micronesians  and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia  all these peoples most certainly derived from that region and not the New World or elsewhere  The undisputed pre Columbian presence in Oceania of the sweet potato  which is a New World domesticate  has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl s  American Indians in the Pacific  theories  However  this is one plant out of a long list of Southeast Asian domesticates  As Patrick Kirch  an American anthropologist  points out  rather than being brought by rafting South Americans  sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning Polynesian navigators who could have reached the west coast of South America



1  According to paragraph 1  all of the following are true statements about Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia EXCEPT
 Collectively  these regions are traditionally known as Oceania
 These islands of Micronesia are small and spread out
 Hawaii  Easter Island  and New Zealand mark the boundaries of Polynesia
 Melanesia is situated to the north of Micronesia


2  By stating that the theories are  mutually exclusive  the author means that
 if one of the theories is true  then all the others must be false
 the differences between the theories are unimportant
 taken together  the theories cover all possibilities
 the theories support each other

3  The word  overwhelming  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 powerful
 favorable
 current
 reasonable






4  According to paragraph 2  which of the following led some early researchers to believe that the Pacific islanders originally came from Egypt
 Egyptians were known to have founded other great civilizations
 Sailors from other parts of the world were believed to lack the skills needed to travel across the ocean
 Linguistic  archaeological  and biological data connected the islands to Egypt
 Egyptian accounts claimed responsibility for colonizing the Pacific as well as the Americas

5  Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 2 about early theories of where the first inhabitants of the Pacific islands came from
 They were generally based on solid evidence
 They tried to account for the origin of the characteristic features of the languages spoken by Pacific islanders
 They assumed that the peoples living in Southeast Asia did not have the skills needed to sail to the Pacific islands
 They questioned the ideas of G  Elliot Smith and W  J  Perry

6  The word  implements  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 skills
 tools
 tools
 opportunities
 practices

7  All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as required for successful colonization of the Pacific islands EXCEPT
 knowledge of various Austronesian languages
 a variety of fishing techniques
 navigational skills
 knowledge of plant cultivation

8  In paragraph 3  why does the author provide information about the types of crops grown and boats used in Southeast Asia during the period around 5000 B  C  E
 To evaluate the relative importance of agriculture and fishing to early Austronesian peoples
 To illustrate the effectiveness of archaeological and linguistic methods in discovering details about life in ancient times
 To contrast living conditions on the continent of Asia with living conditions on the Pacific islands
 To demonstrate that people from this region had the skills and resources necessary to travel to and survive on the Pacific islands


9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Some people have argued that the Pacific was settled by traders who became lost while transporting domesticated plants and animals
 The original Polynesian settlers were probably marooned on the islands  but they may have been joined later by carefully prepared colonization expeditions
 Although it seems reasonable to believe that colonization expeditions would set out fully stocked  this is contradicted by much of the evidence
 The settlement of the Pacific islands was probably intentional and well planned rather than accidental as some people have proposed

10  The word  undisputed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 mysterious
 unexpected
 acknowledged
 significant

11  According to paragraph 4  which of the following is NOT an explanation for why a group of people might have wanted to colonize the Pacific islands
 As their numbers increased  they needed additional territory
 The winds and currents made the islands easy to reach
 The political situation at home made emigration desirable
 They found exploration challenging and exciting

12  Why does the author mention the views of  Patrick Kirch
 To present evidence in favor of Heyerdahl s idea about American Indians reaching Oceania
 To emphasize the familiarity of Pacific islanders with crops from many different regions of the world
 To indicate that supposed proof for Heyerdahl s theory has an alternative explanation
 To demonstrate that some of the same crops were cultivated in both South America and Oceania




13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Later theories concentrate on journeys in the other direction
Where could the sentence best fit

Together  Melanesia  Micronesia  and Polynesia make up the region described as the Pacific islands  or Oceania



Answer Choices

 The first Europeans to reach the area assumed that the islands  original inhabitants must have drifted to Oceania  perhaps from Egypt or the Americas
 It is now believed that the process of colonization required a great deal of skill  determination  and planning and could not have happened by chance
 Using linguistic and archaeological evidence  anthropologists have determined that the first Pacific islanders were Austronesian people from Southeast Asia
 New evidence suggests that  rather than being isolated  Pacific islanders engaged in trade and social interaction with peoples living in Southeast Asia
 Although early colonizers of the islands probably came from agriculture based societies  they were obliged to adopt an economy based on fishing
 Computer simulations of the winds and currents in the Pacific have shown that reaching the Pacific islands was probably much easier than previously thought
