The Expression of Emotions
Joy and sadness are experienced by people in all cultures around the world  but how can we tell when other people are happy or despondent  It turns out that the expression of many emotions may be universal  Smiling is apparently a universal sign of friendliness and approval  Baring the teeth in a hostile way  as noted by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century  may be a universal sign of anger  As the originator of the theory of evolution  Darwin believed that the universal recognition of facial expressions would have survival value  For example  facial expressions could signal the approach of enemies  or friends  in the absence of language
Most investigators concur that certain facial expressions suggest the same emotions in all people  Moreover  people in diverse cultures recognize the emotions manifested by the facial expressions  In classic research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger  disgust  fear  happiness  and sadness  He then asked people around the world to indicate what emotions were being depicted in them  Those queried ranged from European college students to members of the Fore  a tribe that dwells in the New Guinea highlands  All groups  including the Fore  who had almost no contact with Western culture  agreed on the portrayed emotions  The Fore also displayed familiar facial expressions when asked how they would respond if they were the characters in stories that called for basic emotional responses  Ekman and his colleagues more recently obtained similar results in a study of ten cultures in which participants were permitted to report that multiple emotions were shown by facial expressions  The participants generally agreed on which two emotions were being shown and which emotion was more intense
Psychological researchers generally recognize that facial expressions reflect emotional states  In fact  various emotional states give rise to certain patterns of electrical activity in the facial muscles and in the brain  The facial feedback hypothesis argues  however  that the causal relationship between emotions and facial expressions can also work in the opposite direction  According to this hypothesis  signals from the facial muscles   feedback   are sent back to emotion centers of the brain  and so a person s facial expression can influence that person s emotional state  Consider Darwin s words   The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it  On the other hand  the repression  as far as possible  of all outward signs softens our emotions   Can smiling give rise to feelings of good will  for example  and frowning to anger
Psychological research has given rise to some interesting findings concerning the facial feedback hypothesis  Causing participants in experiments to smile  for example  leads them to report more positive feelings and to rate cartoons  humorous drawings of people or situations  as being more humorous  When they are caused to frown  they rate cartoons as being more aggressive
What are the possible links between facial expressions and emotion  One link is arousal  which is the level of activity or preparedness for activity in an organism  Intense contraction of facial muscles  such as those used in signifying fear  heightens arousal  Self perception of heightened arousal then leads to heightened emotional activity  Other links may involve changes in brain temperature and the release of neurotransmitters  substances that transmit nerve impulses   The contraction of facial muscles both influences the internal emotional state and reflects it  Ekman has found that the so called Duchenne smile  which is characterized by   crow s feet  wrinkles around the eyes and a subtle drop in the eye cover fold so that the skin above the eye moves down slightly toward the eyeball  can lead to pleasant feelings
Ekman s observation may be relevant to the British expression  keep a stiff upper lip  as a recommendation for handling stress  It might be that a  stiff  lip suppresses emotional response as long as the lip is not quivering with fear or tension  But when the emotion that leads to stiffening the lip is more intense  and involves strong muscle tension  facial feedback may heighten emotional response
