Industrial Revolution Machines

The industrial Revolution started in England in the mid-1700s. In the beginning, most industrialization was in mining and textiles. Inventors created several machines that made work easier. James Watt developed better steam engines. These helped power the Industrial Revolution. Steam pumps that could pump water out of coal mines were made. Miners could then dig deeper into the ground. This let them get more coal.

In textiles, the spinning jenny was invented. This was a machine that could spin yarn. It was mad in 1764. Before that, all yarn was spun by hand. People did this in their homes. It took a long time and a lot of work for people to make yarn. But the spinning jenny spun yarn at ten times the rate people did it by hand. The spinning jenny and other machines helped people work easier and faster. They set the stage for the Industrial Revolution.
