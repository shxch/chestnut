Agriculture  Iron  and the Bantu Peoples
There is evidence of agriculture in Africa prior to 3000 B C  It may have developed independently  but many scholars believe that the spread of agriculture and iron throughout Africa linked it to the major centers of the Near East and Mediterranean world  The drying up of what is now the Sahara desert had pushed many peoples to the south into sub Sahara Africa  These peoples settled at first in scattered hunting and gathering bands  although in some places near lakes and rivers  people who fished  with a more secure food supply  lived in larger population concentrations  Agriculture seems to have reached these people from the Near East  since the first domesticated crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are not African but west Asian  Once the idea of planting diffused  Africans began to develop their own crops  such as certain varieties of rice  and they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to new imports  The proposed areas of the domestication of African crops lie in a band that extends from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to West Africa  Subsequently  other crops  such as bananas  were introduced from Southeast Asia
Livestock also came from outside Africa  Cattle were introduced from Asia  as probably were domestic sheep and goats  Horses were apparently introduced by the Hyksos invaders of Egypt  1780 1560 B C   and then spread across the Sudan to West Africa  Rock paintings in the Sahara indicate that horses and chariots were used to traverse the desert and that by 300 200 B C   there were trade routes across the Sahara  Horses were adopted by peoples of the West African savannah  and later their powerful cavalry forces allowed them to carve out large empires  Finally  the camel was introduced around the first century A D  This was an important innovation  because the camel s abilities to thrive in harsh desert conditions and to carry large loads cheaply made it an effective and efficient means of transportation  The camel transformed the desert from a barrier into a still difficult  but more accessible  route of trade and communication
Iron came from West Asia  although its routes of diffusion were somewhat different than those of agriculture  Most of Africa presents a curious case in which societies moved directly from a technology of stone to iron without passing through the intermediate stage of copper or bronze metallurgy  although some early copper working sites have been found in West Africa  Knowledge of iron making penetrated into the forest and savannahs of West Africa at roughly the same time that iron making was reaching Europe  Evidence of iron making has been found in Nigeria  Ghana  and Mali
This technological shift cause profound changes in the complexity of African societies  Iron represented power  In West Africa the blacksmith who made tools and weapons had an important place in society  often with special religious powers and functions  Iron hoes  which made the land more productive  and iron weapons  which made the warrior more powerful  had symbolic meaning in a number of West Africa societies  Those who knew the secrets of making iron gained ritual and sometimes political power
Unlike in the Americas  where metallurgy was a very late and limited development  Africans had iron from a relatively early date  developing ingenious furnaces to produce the high heat needed for production and to control the amount of air that reached the carbon and iron ore necessary for making iron  Much of Africa moved right into the Iron Age  taking the basic technology and adapting it to local conditions and resources
The diffusion of agriculture and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations  These people probably originated in eastern Nigeria  Their migration may have been set in motion by an increase in population caused by a movement of peoples fleeing the desiccation  or drying up  of the Sahara  They spoke a language  proto Bantu   Bantu  means  the people    which is the parent tongue of a language of a large number of Bantu languages still spoken throughout sub Sahara Africa  Why and how these people spread out into central and southern Africa remains a mystery  but archaeologists believe that their iron weapons allowed them to conquer their hunting gathering opponents  who still used stone implements  Still  the process is uncertain  and peaceful migration or simply rapid demographic growth may have also caused the Bantu explosion




1  The word  diffused  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 emerged
 was understood
 spread
 developed
2  According to paragraph 1  why do researchers doubt that agriculture developed independently in Africa
 African lakes and rivers already provided enough food for people to survive without agriculture
 The earliest examples of cultivated plants discovered in Africa are native to Asia
 Africa s native plants are very difficult to domesticate
 African communities were not large enough to support agriculture
3  In paragraph 1  what does the author imply about changes in the African environment during this time period
 The climate was becoming milder  allowing for a greater variety of crops to be grown
 Although periods of drying forced people south  they returned once their food supply was secure
 Population growth along rivers and lakes was dramatically decreasing the availability of fish
 A region that had once supported many people was becoming a desert where few could survive
4  According to paragraph 2  camels were important because they
 were the first domesticated animal to be introduced to Africa
 allowed the people of the West African savannahs to carve out large empires
 helped African peoples defend themselves against Egyptian invaders
 made it cheaper and easier to cross the Sahara

5  According to paragraph 2  which of the following were subjects of rock paintings in the Sahara
 Horses and chariots
 Sheep and goats
 Hyksos invaders from Egypt
 Camels and cattle



6  What function does paragraph 3 serve in the organization of the passage as a whole
 It contrasts the development of iron technology in West Asia and West Africa
 It discusses a non agricultural contribution to Africa from Asia
 It introduces evidence that a knowledge of copper working reached Africa and Europe at the same time
 It compares the rates at which iron technology developed in different parts of Africa



7  The word  profound  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 fascinating
 far reaching
 necessary
 temporary


8  The word  ritual  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 military
 physical
 ceremonial
 permanent

9  According to paragraph 4  all of the following were social effects of the new metal technology in Africa EXCEPT
 Access to metal tools and weapons created greater social equality
 Metal weapons increased the power of warriors
 Iron tools helped increase the food supply
 Technical knowledge gave religious power to its holders











10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 While American iron makers developed the latest furnaces  African iron makers continued using earlier techniques
 Africans produced iron much earlier than Americans  inventing technologically sophisticated heating systems
 Iron making developed earlier in Africa than in the Americas because of the ready availability of carbon and iron ore
 Both Africa and the Americas developed the capacity for making iron early  but African metallurgy developed at a slower rate






11  The word  fleeing  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 afraid of
 displaced by
 running away from
 responding to

12  Paragraph 6 mentions all of the following as possible causes of the  Bantu explosion  EXCEPT
 superior weapons
 better hunting skills
 peaceful migration
 increased population



13  Look at the four squares  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
These people had a significant linguistic impact on the continent as well
Where would the sentence best fit

14  Direction An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

Agriculture and iron working probably spread to Africa from neighboring regions




Answer choices

 Once Africans developed their own crops  they no longer borrowed from other regions
 The harshness of the African climate meant that agriculture could not develop until after the introduction of iron tools
 The use of livestock improved transportation and trade and allowed for new forms of political control
 As the Sahara expanded  the camel gained in importance  eventually coming to have religious significance
 The spread of iron working had far reaching effects on social  economic  and political organization in Africa
 Today s Bantu speaking peoples are descended from a technologically advanced people who spread throughout Africa
