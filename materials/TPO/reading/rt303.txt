The Invention of the Mechanical Clock

In Europe  before the introduction of the mechanical clock  people told time by sun  using  for example  shadow sticks or sun dials  and water clocks  Sun clocks worked  of course  only on clear days  water clocks misbehaved when the temperature fell toward freezing  to say nothing of long run drift as the result of sedimentation and clogging  Both these devices worked well in sunny climates  but in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time  while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night

Medieval Europe gave new importance to reliable time  The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers  one of which was at night  requiring an alarm arrangement to waken monks before dawn  And then the new cities and towns  squeezed by their walls  had to know and order time in order to organize collective activity and ration space  They set a time to go to sleep  All this was compatible with older devices so long as there was only one authoritative timekeeper  but with urban growth and the multiplication of time signals  discrepancy brought discord and strife  Society needed a more dependable instrument of time measurement and found it in the mechanical clock

We do not know who invented this machine  or where  It seems to have appeared in Italy and England  perhaps simultaneous invention  between 1275 and 1300  Once known  it spread rapidly  driving out water clocks but not solar dials  which were needed to check the new machines against the timekeeper of last resort  These early versions were rudimentary  inaccurate  and prone to breakdown

Ironically  the new machine tended to undermine Catholic Church authority  Although church ritual had sustained an interest in timekeeping throughout the centuries of urban collapse that followed the fall of Rome  church time was nature s time  Day and night were divided into the same number of parts  so that except at the equinoxes  days and night hours were unequal  and then of course the length of these hours varied with the seasons  But the mechanical clock kept equal hours  and this implied a new time reckoning  The Catholic Church resisted  not coming over to the new hours for about a century  From the start  however  the towns and cities took equal hours as their standard  and the public clocks installed in town halls and market squares became the very symbol of a new  secular municipal authority  Every town wanted one  conquerors seized them as especially precious spoils of war  tourists came to see and hear these machines the way they made pilgrimages to sacred relics

The clock was the greatest achievement of medieval mechanical ingenuity  Its general accuracy could be checked against easily observed phenomena  like the rising and setting of the sun  The result was relentless pressure to improve technique and design  At every stage  clockmakers led the way to accuracy and precision  they became masters of miniaturization  detectors and correctors of error  searchers for new and better  They were thus the pioneers of mechanical engineering and served as examples and teachers to other branches of engineering

The clock brought order and control  both collective and personal  Its public display and private possession laid the basis for temporal autonomy  people could now coordinate comings and goings without dictation from above  The clock provided the punctuation marks for group activity  while enabling individuals to order their own work  and that of others  so as to enhance productivity  Indeed  the very notion of productivity is a by product of the clock  once on can relate performance to uniform time units  work is never the same  One moves from the task oriented time consciousness of the peasant  working on job after another  as time and light permit  and the time filling busyness of the domestic servant  who always had something to do  to an effort to maximize product per unit of time


1  Why does the author provide the information that  in northern Europe the sun may be hidden by clouds for weeks at a time  while temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day to night
  To emphasize the variety of environments in which people used sun and water clocks to tell time
  To illustrate the disadvantage of sun and water clocks
  To provide an example of an area where water clocks have an advantage over sun clocks
  To counter the claim that sun and water clocks were used all over Europe


2  According to paragraph 2  all of the following are examples of the importance of timekeeping to medieval European society EXCEPT
  the need of different towns to coordinate timekeeping with each other
  the setting of specific times for the opening and closing of markets
  the setting of specific time for the start and finish of the working day
  the regulation of the performance of daily church rituals

3  According to paragraph 2  why did the medieval church need an alarm arrangement
  The alarm warned the monks of discord or strife in the town
  The church was responsible for regulating working hours and market hours
  The alarm was needed in case fires were not put out each night
  One of the church s daily rituals occurred during the night

4  The word  authoritative  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  actual
  important
  official
  effective



5  The author uses the phrase  the timekeeper of last resort  to refer to
  water clocks
  the sun
  mechanical clocks
  the church


6  The word  rudimentary  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  rare
  small
  impractical
  basic


7  According to paragraph 4  how did the Catholic Church react to the introduction of mechanical clocks
  It used mechanical clocks through the period of urban collapse
  It used clocks to better understand natural phenomena  like equinoxes
  It tried to preserve its own method of keeping time  which was different from mechanical clock time
  It used mechanical clocks to challenge secular  town authorities

8  The word  installed  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  required
  expected by the majority of people
  standardized
  put in place






9  It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that medieval clockmakers
  were able to continually make improvements in the accuracy of mechanical clocks
  were sometimes not well respected by other engineers
  sometimes made claims about the accuracy of mechanical clocks that were not true
  rarely shared their expertise with other engineers


10  Paragraph 5 answers which of the following questions about mechanical clocks
  How did early mechanical clocks work
  Why did the design of mechanical clocks affect engineering in general
  How were mechanical clocks made
  What influenced the design of the first mechanical clock


11  The word  pioneers  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  leaders
  opponents
  employers
  guardians



12  According to paragraph 6  how did the mechanical clock affect labor
  It encouraged workers to do more time filling busywork
  It enabled workers to be more task oriented
  It pushed workers to work more hours every day
  It led to a focus on productivity

The introduction of the mechanical clock caused important changes to the society of medieval Europe




Answer Choices

  The increasing complexity of social and economic activity in medieval Europe led to the need for a more dependable means of keeping time than sun and water clocks provided
  Because they were unreliable even in sunny climates  sun clocks and water clocks were rarely used in Europe  even before the invention of the mechanical clock
  Before the mechanical clock  every city wanted a large number of timekeepers because more timekeepers allowed for better organization of collective activities
  Soon after the invention of mechanical clocks  sun and water clocks became obsolete because mechanical clocks were far more accurate
  Although society in general was quick to adopt the mechanical clock  the Catholic Church  resisted  it because  it challenged the authority of the church
  Clockmakers introduced  precision  engineering  and their clocks  gave individuals and groups more control over the organization  of their  activities
