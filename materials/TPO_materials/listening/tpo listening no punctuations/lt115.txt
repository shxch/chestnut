TPO11 Lecture 3 Environmental science

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class

Professor
When land gets developed for human use  the landscape changes  We don t see as many types of vegetation  trees  grasses and so forth  This in turn leads to other losses  the loss of animals that once lived there  Err…but these are the obvious changes  but there are also less obvious changes like the climate  One interesting case of this…uh…of changes in the local land use causing changes in climate  specifically the temperature is in Florida  Now what comes to mind when you think of the state of Florida

Student A
Sunshine  beaches

Student B
Warm weather  oranges…

Professor
Yes  exactly  Florida has long had a great citrus industry  large growth of oranges  lemons and the like  Florida s winter is very mild  the temperature doesn t often get below freezing  But there are some areas of Florida that do freeze  So in the early 1900s  farmers moved even further south in Florida  to areas that were even less likely to freeze  Obviously  freezing temperatures are a danger to the crops  A bad bout of cold weather  a long spell of frosts could ruin a farmer s entire crop  anyway  before the citrus growers moved south  much of the land in south Florida  was what we called wetlands  Wetlands are areas of marshy  swampy land  areas where water covers the soil  or is present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year  Wetlands have their own unique ecosystems  with plants and animals with special and interesting adaptations  Very exciting  but it s not what we are talking about today  Emm…where was I

Student A
Farmers moved south

Professor
Oh  yes  Farmers moved south  But the land was not suitable for farming  You can t grow oranges in wetlands  so farmers had to transform the wetlands into land suitable for farming  To do that  you have to drain the water from the land  move the water elsewhere  and divert the water sources such as rivers  Hundreds of miles of drainage canals were built in the wetlands

Now these areas  the new areas the farmers moved to  used to be warm and unlikely to freeze  however  recently the area has become susceptible to freezes  And we are trying to understand why

Student B
Is it some global temperature change or weather pattern like El Ni?o or something

Professor
Well  there are two theories  One idea is as you suggest that major weather patterns  something like El Ni?o  are responsible  But the other idea and this is the one that I personally subscribe to  is that the changes in the temperature pattern have been brought about by the loss of the wetlands

Student A
Well  how would loss of wetlands make a difference

Professor
Well  think about what we ve been studying so far  We ve discussed the impact of landscapes on temperature  right  What effects does a body of water have on an area

Student A
Oh  yeah  Bodies of water tend to absorb the heat during the day  and then they release the heat at night

Professor
Yes  exactly  What you just said is what I want you all to understand  Bodies of water release heat and moisture back into the environment  So places near large bodies of water are generally milder  err   slightly warmer than those without water  And what I and others think is that the loss of the wetlands has created a situation where the local temperatures in the area are now slightly different  slightly colder than they were 100 years ago  before the wetlands were drained

Student B
Hmm…do we know what the temperature was like back then

Professor
Well  we were able to estimate this  We have data about South Florida s current landscape  uh…the plant cover  And we were able to reconstruct data about its landscape prior to 1900  Then we enter those data  information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetlands were drained  We enter the data into a computer weather model  This model can predict temperatures  And when all of the data were entered  an overall cooling trend was predicted by the model

Student B
How much colder does it get now

Professor
Well  actually the model shows a drop of only a few degrees Celsius  But this is enough to cause dramatic damage to crops  If temperatures overnight are already very close to the freezing point  then this drop of just a few degrees can take the temperature below freezing  And freezing causes frosts  which kill crops  These damaging frosts wouldn t happen if the wetlands were still in existence  just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequences
