Shed Some Light on the Workplace
Studies have shown that employees are happier,
environment 2 in which temperatures are carefully
controlled. New buildings may be designed with these
studies in mind, but many older buildings were not,
resulting in spaces that often depend primarily on
artificial lighting. While employers may balk at the
expense of reconfiguring such buildings to increase the
amount of natural light, the investment has been shown
to be well worth it in the long run—for both employees
and employers.

For one thing, lack of exposure to natural light has a
significant impact on employees’ health. A study
conducted in 2013 by Northwestern University in
Chicago showed that inadequate natural light could
result in eye strain, headaches, and fatigue, as well as
interference with the body’s circadian rhythms. 3
Circadian rhythms, which are controlled by the
4 bodies biological clocks, influence body temperature,
hormone release, cycles of sleep and wakefulness, and
other bodily functions. Disruptions of circadian rhythms
have been linked to sleep disorders, diabetes, depression,

At this point, the writer is considering adding the
following sentence.
Workers in offices with windows sleep an
average of 46 minutes more per night than
workers in offices without windows.
Should the writer make this addition here?
A) Yes, because it supplies quantitative data that
will be examined in the rest of the paragraph.
B) Yes, because it explains the nature of the bodily
functions referred to in the next sentence.
C) No, because it interrupts the discussion of
circadian rhythms.
D) No, because it does not take into account
whether workers were exposed to sunlight
outside the office.

D) body’s biological clock’s,
and bipolar disorder. Like any other health problems,
these ailments can increase employee absenteeism,
which, in turn, 5 is costly for employers. Employees
who feel less than 100 percent and are sleep deprived are
also less prone to work at their maximal productivity.

employees’ morale when it moved from an artificially lit

7 Artificial light sources are also costly aside from
lowering worker productivity. They typically constitute
anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of a building’s energy
use. When a plant in Seattle, Washington, was redesigned
for more natural light, the company was able to enjoy
annual electricity cost reductions of $500,000 8 each
year.

In context, which choice best combines the
underlined sentences?
A) Aside from lowering worker productivity,
artificial light sources are also costly, typically
constituting anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of a
building’s energy use.
B) The cost of artificial light sources, aside from
lowering worker productivity, typically
constitutes anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of a
building’s energy use.
C) Typically constituting 25 to 50 percent of a
building’s energy use, artificial light sources
lower worker productivity and are costly.
D) Artificial lights, which lower worker productivity
and are costly, typically constitute anywhere
from 25 to 50 percent of a building’s energy use.

Among the possibilities to reconfigure a building’s
lighting is the installation of full-pane windows to allow
the greatest degree of sunlight to reach office interiors.
9 Thus, businesses can install light tubes, 10 these are
pipes placed in workplace roofs to capture and funnel
sunlight down into a building’s interior. Glass walls and
dividers can also be used to replace solid walls as a means
11 through distributing natural light more freely.
Considering the enormous costs of artificial lighting,
both in terms of money and productivity, investment in
such improvements should be a natural choice for
businesses.
