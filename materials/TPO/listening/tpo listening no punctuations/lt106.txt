OK  If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember  I ll bet for most of you  your earliest memory would be from about age 3  right  Well  that s true for most adults  We can t remember anything that happened before the age of 3  And this phenomenon is so widespread and well documented it has a name  It is called childhood amnesia and was first documented in 1893

As I said  this phenomenon refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents  It s not children trying to remember events from last month or last year  Of course it follows that if you can t remember an incident as a child  you probably won t remember it as an adult  OK

So …so    so why is this  What are the reasons for childhood amnesia
Well  once a popular explanation was that childhood memories are repressed     uh  the memories are disturbing so that as adults we keep them buried  and so we can t recall them  And this is based on…well  well  it s not based on  on  on… the kind of solid research and lab testing we want to talk about today  So let s put that explanation aside and concentrate on just two  OK

It   it could be that as children we do form memories of things prior to age 3  but forget them as we get grow older  that s one explanation  Another possibility is that children younger than three lack   uh   lack some cognitive capacity for memory  And that idea  that children are unable to form memories  that s been the dominant belief in psychology for the past hundred years

And this idea is very much tied to two things  the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language development in children

So Piaget s theory of cognitive development  Piaget suggested that because they don t have language  children younger than 18 to 24 months live in the here and now  that is they lack the mean to symbolically represent objects and events  that are not physically present  Everybody get that  Piaget proposed that young children don t have a way to represent things that aren t right in front of them  That s what language does  right  Words represent things  ideas

Once language starts to develop from about age 2  they do have a system for symbolic representation and can talk about things which aren t in their immediate environment including the past  Of course he didn t claim that infants don t have any sort of memory  it s acknowledged that they can recognize some stimuli  like faces  And for many years this model was very much in favor in psychology  even though memory tests were never performed on young children

Well  finally in the 1980s  a study was done  And this study showed that very young children under the age of 2 do have the capacity for recall  Now  if the children can  t talk  how was recall tested  Well  that is a good question  since the capacity for recall has always been linked with the ability to talk

So the researchers set up an experiment using imitation based tasks  Adults used props  uh  toys or other objects to demonstrate an action that had 2 steps  The children were asked to imitate the steps immediately and then again after delays of one or more month  And even after a delay  the children could…could recall or replicate the action  the objects used  the steps involved and the order of the steps  Even children as young as 9 months

Now  tests showed that there was a faster rate of forgetting among the youngest children  but most importantly it showed that the development of recall did not depend on language development  And that was an importance finding

I guess I should add that the findings don t say that there was no connection   no connection between the development of language and memory  There s some of evidence that being able to talk about an event does lead to having a stronger memory of that event  But that does not seem to be the real issue here

So  back to our question about the cause of childhood amnesia  well  there is something called the rate of forgetting  And childhood amnesia may reflect a high rate of forgetting  in other words  children under the age of 3 do form memories and do so without language  But they forget the memories at a fast rate  probably faster than adults do  Researchers have set a standard… sort of an expected rate of forgetting  but that expected rate was set based on the tests done on adults  So what is the rate of forgetting for children under the age of 3  We expect it to be high  but the tests to prove this really haven t been done yet
