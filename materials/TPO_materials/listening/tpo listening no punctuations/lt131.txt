Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his psychology professor

Professor
Good afternoon  Alex  can I help you with something

Student
Well  I wanted to talk with you about the research project you assigned today  I um…I hope you could clarify a few things for me

Professor
I ll certainly try

Student
Ok  all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them  right

Professor
Ur  that s a start  but you ll need to do some research  too  Then you will write a paper that is not so much about the observations  but a synthesis of what you have observed and read

Student
Ok… And what about the children I am supposed to observe

Professor
Not children  a single child observed twice

Student
Oh…Ok  so I should choose a child with the permission of the child s parent of course and then observe that child a couple of times and take good notes  then

Professor
Actually after your first observation  you ll go back and look through your textbook or go to a library and find a few sources concerning the stage of development this particular child is in  And then  with that knowledge  you will make a second observation of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited

Student
Can you give me an example

Professor
Well  um  if you observed a four year old child  for example  my daughter is 4 years old  you might read up on Piaget s stages of cognitive development we covered those in class

Student
Uh huh

Professor
Uh  most likely  what stage would a child of that age be in

Student
Um… the pre operational stage

Professor
Exactly  if that s the case  her language use would be maturing and her memory and imagination would be developed

Student
So she might play pretend like she can pretend when driving her toy car across a couch that the couch is actually a bridge or something

Professor
That is right  In addition  her thinking would be primarily egocentric

Student
So she would be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs  and might not be able to see things from anyone else s perspective

Professor
Hmm  huh

Student
But what if she doesn t  I mean  what if she doesn t demonstrate those behaviors

Professor
That s fine  you ll note that in your paper  See  your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain stages of development with what you actually observed

Student
Ok  I have one more question now

Professor
And what s that

Student
Where can I find a child to observe

Professor
Um  I suggest you contact the education department secretary  She has a list of contacts at various schools and with certain families who are somehow connected to the university  Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects like yours

Student
Ok  I ll stop by the education department office this afternoon

Professor
And if you have any trouble or any more questions  feel free to come by during my office hours
