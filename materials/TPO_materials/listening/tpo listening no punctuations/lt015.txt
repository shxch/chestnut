OK  we ve been talking about early agriculture in the near east  So let s concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it  Let s look at Catalhoyuk  Um… I d better write that down  Catalhoyuk  that s about as close as we get in English  It s Turkish  really  The site s in modern day Turkey  and who knows what the original inhabitants called it  Anyway  uh…Catalhoyuk wasn t the first agricultural settlement in the near east  but it was pretty early  settled about 9 000 years ago in the Neolithic period  And     um    the settlement   uh   town really  lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people  That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time

One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period  It s the Neolithic  remember  the late Stone Age  So the people that lived there had only stone tools  no metals  So everything they accomplished  like building this town  they did with just stone  plus wood  bricks  that sort of thing  But you got to remember that it wasn t just any stone they had  they had obsidian  And um    obsidian is a black  volcanic  well  almost like glass  It flakes very nicely into really sharp points  The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian  And uh    the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland  from central Turkey  traded for it  probably

Anyway  what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built  The houses are all rectangular  one storey  made of sun dried bricks  But what s really interesting is that there are no spaces between them  no streets in other words  and so generally no doors on the houses either  People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof  down a wooden ladder  You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls  Once you were in the house  there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage  The main room had the hearths  for cooking and for heat  It would ve been pretty cold during the winters  And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire  There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes  but no chimney  The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves  So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out  You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there  You can see on the walls  which they plastered and decorated with paintings  They ended up with a layer of black soot on them  and so did people s lungs  The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs

And that s another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk  the burial sites  The graves have all been found under the houses  right under the floors  And it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets  I mean  you might think it was for protection or something  but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger  It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors  graves and be buried near them themselves  But it makes a good point  Based on excavations  we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves  but we re only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way  That s the way it is with archeology  You are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind  We have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things  I mean it s interesting to speculate  And the physical artifacts can give us clues  but there is a lot we can t really know  So  for instance  their art  They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them  Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep  but we don t know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes  Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance  That s the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues  And hopefully  further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more clues  But we ll probably never know for sure
