Artisans and Industrialization
Before 1815 manufacturing in the United States had been done in homes or shops by skilled artisans  As master craft workers  they imparted the knowledge of their trades to apprentices and journeymen  In addition  women often worked in their homes part time  making finished articles from raw material supplied by merchant capitalists  After 1815 this older form of manufacturing began to give way to factories with machinery tended by unskilled or semiskilled laborers  Cheap transportation networks  the rise of cities  and the availability of capital and credit all stimulated the shift to factory production 
The creation of a labor force that was accustomed to working in factories did not occur easily  Before the rise of the factory  artisans had worked within the home  Apprentices were considered part of the family  and masters were responsible not only for teaching their apprentices a trade but also for providing them some education and for supervising their moral behavior  Journeymen knew that if they perfected their skill  they could become respected master artisans with their own shops  Also  skilled artisans did not work by the clock  at a steady pace  but rather in bursts of intense labor alternating with more leisurely time 
The factory changed that  Goods produced by factories were not as finished or elegant as those done by hand  and pride in craftsmanship gave way to the pressure to increase rates of productivity  The new methods of doing business involved a new and stricter sense of time  Factory life necessitated a more regimented schedule  where work began at the sound of a bell and workers kept machines going at a constant pace  At the same time  workers were required to discard old habits  for industrialism demanded a worker who was alert  dependable  and self disciplined  Absenteeism and lateness hurt productivity and  since work was specialized  disrupted the regular factory routine  Industrialization not only produced a fundamental change in the way work was organized  it transformed the very nature of work 
The first generation to experience these changes did not adopt the new attitudes easily  The factory clock became the symbol of the new work rules  One mill worker who finally quit complained revealingly about  obedience to the ding dong of the bell just as though we are so many living machines   With the loss of personal freedom also came the loss of standing in the community  Unlike artisan workshops in which apprentices worked closely with the masters supervising them  factories sharply separated workers from management  Few workers rose through the ranks to supervisory positions  and even fewer could achieve the artisan s dream of setting up one s own business  Even well paid workers sensed their decline in status 
In this newly emerging economic order  workers sometimes organized to protect their rights and traditional ways of life  Craft workers such as carpenters  printers  and tailors formed unions  and in 1834 individual unions came together in the National Trades  Union  The labor movement gathered some momentum in the decade before the Panic of 1837  but in the depression that followed  labor s strength collapsed  During hard times  few workers were willing to strike* or engage in collective action  And skilled craft workers  who spearheaded the union movement  did not feel a particularly strong bond with semiskilled factory workers and unskilled laborers  More than a decade of agitation did finally bring a workday shortened to 10 hours to most industries by the 1850 s  and the courts also recognized workers  right to strike  but these gains had little immediate impact 
Workers were united in resenting the industrial system and their loss of status  but they were divided by ethnic and racial antagonisms  gender  conflicting religious perspectives  occupational differences  political party loyalties  and disagreements over tactics  For them  the factory and industrialism were not agents of opportunity but reminders of their loss of independence and a measure of control over their lives  As United States society became more specialized and differentiated  greater extremes of wealth began to appear  And as the new markets created fortunes for the few  the factory system lowered the wages of workers by dividing labor into smaller  less skilled tasks
