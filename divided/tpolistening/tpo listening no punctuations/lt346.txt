Lecture4 Business Management  The Life Cycle of Innovation
Narrator
Listen to part of a discussion in a business management class

Professor
Last week we were talking about innovation in business  Remember the graph I showed you
Student
The curve that looked sort of like the letter S
Professor
Right  Cathy  Let s take another look  Do you recall  Cathy  How this S curve represents the life cycle of innovation
Student
Sure  Starting on the left  the new innovation  let s say it s a new product  Almost nobody s heard of it or at least nobody takes it seriously  Then its popularity increases  uh  slowly at first till sales really start accelerating quickly  They are where the line goes up steeply in the middle as more and more get excited about the product and they go out and buy it  But eventually  moving over to the right side there  interest begins to fade and the growth and sales levels off
Professor
At which point the market has matured for that product  We can still sell it and even marginally improve it  but it s not new anymore  It no longer offers exciting growth opportunities  So a business leader might face a choice  either stick with this old  safe  proven idea or move on to the next big idea  a fresh innovation  But innovations are risky  They may succeed or they may not
OK  A case study
George  I have heard your Thursday night program on the campus radio station  You like Jazz  right
Student
Huh   Uh…yeah…sure  But…what
Professor
OK  Stay with me here  On your program last week  I heard an old Miles Davis album  Tell us about that
Student
Uh…Miles Davis  Trumpet  I played a CD of a Jazz classic he recorded in the 1950s called Kind of Blue  It s my all time favorite Jazz recording
Professor
Mine too  Would you call that recording innovative for its time
Student
Absolutely  Nothing at all like what he had recorded up till then  I mean  before that Miles Davis played things so complex that…well…nobody could touch him  But this was something totally new  Suddenly his playing sounded so amazingly simple
Professor
And how did people react to this new sound of Miles Davis
Student
Well…some were disappointed  even angry that he d abandon his old style  But soon most of his fans came around and this new style appealed to a whole new group of jazz listeners
Professor
I guess so  Kind of Blue became the most commercially successful album in the history of jazz  So is there a lesson here anyone  Think of that S curve I showed you
Student
Oh  So his old style of jazz was actually a kind of product  one that had been developed pretty thoroughly  And he d taken it about as far as he could  So he decided to take a big risk and try something totally new
Professor
Exactly  Something completely fresh and cool  And people couldn t get enough of it  It was a brand new beginning that left lots of room for further development artistically  And as a market analyst  you could say that with Kind of Blue  he was jumping to the beginning of a brand new S curve  With all that potential for profitable development still ahead of him
But let me ask you something else  This isn t just the music of a single performer  is it  George
Student
Hardly  More like a group of all stars   Along with Miles Davis on trumpet  there is Bill Evans on piano  John Coltrane on tenor saxophone…
Professor
Individually perhaps the best in the business  But thinking of Miles Davis as the leader of this group  how did he organize and manage all these incredible talent
Student
Well  he d lay out the general outline  the theme and then give each of these star performers  one by one  the creative freedom to really show what they could do with it on their own instrument  to improvise and add something new  but always within the same general theme
Professor
So Miles Davis gets credit for recruiting the best jazz talent anywhere and getting them to collaborate on a fantastic musical product
Everyone see the business parallels here
And give each of these musicians credit for seizing this opportunity and creating great individual performances
But good jazz is more than just individual performance  isn t it
Student
Definitely  Jazz musicians need to listen to each other and go with the flow  Like  one time somebody goofed and came in a little early  but everyone else adjusted and went right along with it  as if nothing were wrong  And this mistake came out like just another unexpected creative interpretation
Professor
Thanks  George  Great insights  ones that would certainly apply to what we are studying here
