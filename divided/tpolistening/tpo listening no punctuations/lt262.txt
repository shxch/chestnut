Last class someone asked about green marketing  Green marketing refers to companies promoting the products as environmentally friendly  Companies often turn to advertising experts to help them do this

Green marketing seems recent  but advertising professionals grew interest in it several decades ago  The seeds for green marketing were probably planted in 1970  when the first Earth Day took place  Rallies all over the United States were organized to protest environmental degradation  Some 20 million demonstrators participated in that first Earth Day  And it helped spark dozens of environmental laws  The biggest was the Endangered Species Act of 1973  which protects imperiled animal species from extinction  There was also passage of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act was strengthened

Earth Day  Environmental Laws  Environmental Issues in the news  Being Green was entering the mainstream  And business started saying  hey  we can get involved in this  So in 1975  a major advertising trade group held its first workshop on ecological marketing  A few years later  we began seeing ads tapping into people s environmental concerns

But some green marketers learned the hard way  green marketing must still involve all the same principles of a traditional marketing campaign  You ad must attract attention  stimulate consumers  interest  create a desire for your product  and motivate people to take action to buy your product

So let me tell you about one green marketing campaign that failed at first and explain why  It was a compact fluorescent light bulb  We ll call it the eco light  It was first introduced  I believe  in the late 90s  It cost far more than a regular incandescent bulb  The advertising message was  basically   use this eco light and save the planet   But that message wasn t effective  Research shows that consumers don t want to let go off any traditional product attributes  like convenience  price and quality  Even though surveys indicate that almost everybody cares about the environment

So the company reintroduced the eco light with a new message  one that emphasized cost savings  which the eco light lowers electric bills and lasts for years  So it s good for earth  cost effective and convenient because it doesn t have to be changed every few months  This ad campaign worked like a charm

Something else  uh  the company that makes the co light  researchers would consider it an  extreme green company   not only because its product are energy efficient  but because the company tries to reduce its environmental impact in other ways too．Like in addition to selling Earth  friendly products  its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and use all sorts of recycled materials．A company that only recycles office paper  researchers would classify as a   lean green company ．And there are other degrees of greenness in between．

So if your green marketing strategy s gonna work  your message should be valid on all dimensions．When a company as a whole is credited for reducing its environmental impact  this can lead to brand loyalty．People will come back and buy your product more and more．However  let s say you re fine for violating the Clean Water Act while manufacturing products from recycled materials  The public would eventually find out．You can t just make the claim that a product is environmentally friendly and not follow through on．
