Annuals and Perennials

The majority of plants are annuals or perennials. Annuals live for a single season and then die. Perennials live for more than two seasons. Parts of them die, but their main parts survive. Some perennials can live for centuries. Biennials are another kind of plant. They live for just two seasons. But they are the least common type of plant.

Many flowers, such as daisies and petunias, are annuals. So are wheat, corn, barley, and other crops. An annual sprouts from the ground, blooms, and then dies all in the space of one growing season. The entire plant—its roots, stems, and leaves—dies. But annuals leave behind seeds that remain dormant in the ground. The next year, new plants grow from these seeds. There are both summer annuals and winter annuals. Summer annuals sprout in spring and live for either weeks or months in summer. Winter annuals may start growing in fall or winter. Then, they bloom in spring and die in summer. Most winter annuals live in climates that lack cold winters.

All trees are perennials. So are potatoes, mint, garlic, strawberries, and many other plants. Perennials with flowers and leaves usually bloom in spring and become dormant in fall. Some only have flowers or bear fruit in their first year. After that, the flowers and fruit never reappear even though the plant continues to live. Other perennials have flowers and fruit every year. Some perennials have adapted to live in harsh environments. They can survive in cold weather and dry conditions. They do this thanks to special structures in them. Deciduous trees, for example, shed their leaves each fall in cold climates. This helps the trees save energy and live during winter. So they are able to survive year after year.
