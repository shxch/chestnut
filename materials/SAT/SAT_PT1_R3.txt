Questions 22-31 are based on the following
passage and supplementary material.
This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.
The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.
The table shows, for various organisms, the percentage of
each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in that
organism’s DNA.

The authors use the word “backbone” in lines 3
and 39 to indicate that
A) only very long chains of DNA can be taken from
an organism with a spinal column.
B) the main structure of a chain in a DNA molecule
is composed of repeating units.
C) a chain in a DNA molecule consists entirely of
phosphate groups or of sugars.
D) nitrogenous bases form the main structural unit
of DNA.
23
A student claims that nitrogenous bases pair
randomly with one another. Which of the following
statements in the passage contradicts the student’s
claim?
A) Lines 5-6 (“To each... types”)
B) Lines 9-10 (“So far... irregular”)
C) Lines 23-25 (“The bases... other”)
D) Lines 27-29 (“One member... chains”)
24
In the second paragraph (lines 12-19), what do the
authors claim to be a feature of biological interest?
A) The chemical formula of DNA
B) The common fiber axis
C) The X-ray evidence
D) DNA consisting of two chains
25
The authors’ main purpose of including the
information about X-ray evidence and density is to
A) establish that DNA is the molecule that carries
the genetic information.
B) present an alternate hypothesis about the
composition of a nucleotide.
C) provide support for the authors’ claim about the
number of chains in a molecule of DNA.
D) confirm the relationship between the density of
DNA and the known chemical formula of DNA.
26
Based on the passage, the authors’ statement “If a
pair consisted of two purines, for example, there
would not be room for it” (lines 29-30) implies that a
pair
A) of purines would be larger than the space
between a sugar and a phosphate group.
B) of purines would be larger than a pair consisting
of a purine and a pyrimidine.
C) of pyrimidines would be larger than a pair of
purines.
D) consisting of a purine and a pyrimidine would be
larger than a pair of pyrimidines.
27
The authors’ use of the words “exact,” “specific,” and
“complement” in lines 47-49 in the final paragraph
functions mainly to
A) confirm that the nucleotide sequences are known
for most molecules of DNA.
B) counter the claim that the sequences of bases
along a chain can occur in any order.
C) support the claim that the phosphate-sugar
backbone of the authors’ model is completely
regular.
D) emphasize how one chain of DNA may serve as a
template to be copied during DNA replication.
