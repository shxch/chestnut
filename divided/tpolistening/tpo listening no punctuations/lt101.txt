Listen to a conversation between a student and her Photography Professor

Student
Professor Johnson  there is something that s been on my mind

Professor
OK
Student
Remember last week  you told us that it s really important to get our photography into a show  basically as soon as we can
Professor
Yup  it s a big step  no question

Student
Thing is  I am sitting here and I am just not sure how I d get there  I mean I ve got some work I like  but is it really what a gallery is looking for  How would I know  how do I make the right contacts to get it into a show  I just really don t
Professor
OK  hold on  slow down  Um…these are questions that  well  just about every young artist has to struggle with  OK  the first thing you should do is you absolutely have to stay true to your artistic vision  take the pictures you want to take
Don t start trying to catch the flavor the month and be trendy because you think you ll get into a show    that never works  because you wind up creating something you don t really believe in  It s uninspired  and won t make any shows  I ve seen it happen so many times  This doesn t mean that you should go into a cave  Keep up with trends  even think about how your work might fit in with them  but don t mindlessly follow them

Student
Well  yeah  I can see that  I think though I have always been able to stay pretty true to what I want to create  not what others want me to create  I think that comes through in my work

Professor
OK  just remember that is one thing to create work that you really want to create when it s in the classroom  The only thing at stake is your grade  But work created outside the classroom  That can be in different story  I m not talking about technique or things like that  It s just that there is so much more at stake when you are out there making art for a living  There s a lot of pressure to become something you are not  and people often surrender to that pressure

Student
But to get stuff exhibited…

Professor
Well  you need to be a bit of an opportunist  You know  common sense things like always having a sample of your work on hand to give to people  You won t believe the kind of contacts and opportunities you can get in this way  And try to get your work seen in the places like restaurants  bookstores  you d be surprised how word gets around about photography in places like that
Student
OK it s just so hard to think about all of those practical things and make good work  you know
