Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class  The professor has been discussing music of the twentieth century

Professor
And what instrument comes to mind when you think of rock  n  roll

Student
The electric Guitar

Professor
Exactly  I think it s fair to say that the sound of the electric guitar typifies the rock  n  roll genre  which became popular in the 1950s  But really the instrument we know today was the result of a continuing development that started for our practical purposes in the 1920s

But long before that even  people were experimenting with ways to modify traditional acoustic guitars  The first guitars were wooden  This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products  Then came steel strings  And that led to the lap guitar  which is also called the steel guitar because the player slides a steel rod up and down the neck  And those are all acoustic guitars  OK

But then eventually we have electric guitars  Over the years  many inventors and musicians contributed to the design of these instruments  And each design was intended to alter the sound in some way  at first at least with the electric guitar  to make it louder

So let s get back to when the steel guitar was first introduced in the United States  It was right after the Spanish American war in the late 1890s  US sailors who were stationed in Hawaii then a US territory were very enamored with the music they heard there  Uh  Hawaiian music was based on the steel guitar I just described  Some sailors learned how to play the steel guitar and brought it home to the States  Before long  Hawaiian steel guitar music was all the rage in the mainland US  It actually had a strong influence on the development of several musical genres  rock  n  roll most notably  but also jazz and blues

Anyway  by the 1920s  with the advent of the public dance movement  people were gathering in large groups to listen to steel guitar music  But they had trouble hearing it  especially in large public settings  As I mentioned  the instrument was played horizontally  on the lap  Since the strings faced upward  the sound was projected toward the ceiling rather than outward toward the audience  Something had to be done  because the music venues and the audience kept getting larger and larger  So what would you do

Student
Find a way to amplify the sound

Professor
Yes  And to do that  inventors started attaching electronic devices  electrical coils to the acoustic guitars  And the electronics worked  But attaching electronics didn t just affect how loudly you could play  It also changed the quality of the sound  These early electric guitars were hollow and these early amplifiers caused vibrations in the bodies of the instruments  So as the sound got louder  it became more distorted  fuzzy sounding  And what musicians at the time wanted was a pure  clean sound

Student
So where does Les Paul fit in  Wasn t he the first to electrify acoustic guitars

Professor
Uhâ€¦no  Electrified guitars already existed by the time Les Paul came into the picture around 1940  What Paul did was experiment with ways of removing the distortions and he succeeded  He designed a guitar with a solid body that relied solely on electronics  Paul s solid body eliminated the vibrations  and thus the distortions

Student
Excuse me  But when I think of electric guitar music  I think of Jimi Hendrix

Professor
Jimi Hendrix  one of my favorites

Student
But Hendrix s style really was all about distortion  that s what s so great about his music  all those special effects  I think a lot of rock  n  roll fans prefer that to a pure sound

Professor
Yeah  You are getting ahead of me here  But good  because the point I was going to make is that the sound of rock  n  roll changed over the years  And the designs and technology of electric guitars made those changes possible

So whereas Les Paul s goal was to remove the distortion  later musicians wanted to produce it  And by the time Jimi Hendrix came around  Well  essentially  Hendrix reinvented the electric guitar  in the sense that he created amazing effects and vibrations that changed the sound of rock  n  roll completely  So eventually  people tried to improve on Les Paul s model  well  to modify it I should say
