Planets in Our Solar System
The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets  their satellites  and numerous small bodies  including asteroids  comets  and meteoroids  An estimated 99 85 percent of the mass of our solar system is contained within the Sun  while the planets collectively make up most of the remaining 0 15 percent  The planets  in order of their distance from the Sun  are Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and Pluto  Under the control of the Sun s gravitational force  each planet maintains an elliptical orbit and all of them travel in the same direction

The planets in our solar system fall into two groups  the terrestrial  Earth like  planets  Mercury  Venus  Earth  and Mars  and the Jovian  Jupiter like  planets  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  and Neptune   Pluto is not included in either category  because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this planet s true nature a mystery

The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size  The largest terrestrial planet  Earth has a diameter only one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet  Neptune  and its mass is only one seventeenth as great  Hence  the Jovian planets are often called giants  Also  because of their relative locations  the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets  while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets  There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes

Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition  The densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5 times the density of water  whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1 5 times the density of water  One of the outer planets  Saturn  has a density of only 0 7 that of water  which means that Saturn would float in water  Variations in the composition of the planets are largely responsible for the density differences  The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups gases  rocks  and ices based on their melting points  The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks  dense rocky and metallic material  with minor amounts of gases  The Jovian planets  on the other hand  contain a large percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium  with varying amounts of ices  mostly water  ammonia  and methane ices

The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen  helium  methane  and ammonia  By comparison  the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best  A planet s ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass  Simply stated  a gas molecule can  evaporate  from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity  For Earth  this velocity is 11 kilometers per second  Any material  including a rocket  must reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go into space  The Jovian planets  because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities  have higher escape velocities  21 60 kilometers per second  than the terrestrial planets  Consequently  it is more difficult for gases to  evaporate  from them  Also  because the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature  at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape  On the other hand  a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity  like Earth s moon  is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere  The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth  Venus  and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide  but even their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small portion of their total mass

The orderly nature of our solar system leads most astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at essentially the same time and from the same material as the Sun  It is hypothesized that the primordial cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter  However  unlike Jupiter  the terrestrial planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices  The explanation may be that the   terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies  relative closeness to the Sun  which meant that their temperatures were relatively high


1  According to the passage  each of the following statements comparing terrestrial planets with Jovian planets is true EXCEPT
 Terrestrial planets are closer to the Sun than Jovian planets
 Terrestrial planets have smaller diameters than Jovian planets
 Terrestrial planets have smaller masses than Jovian planets
 Terrestrial planets travel in a different direction than Jovian planets do





2  The word markedly in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Essentially
 Typically
 Consistently
 noticeably


3  Paragraph 4 mentions which of the following as a reason why terrestrial planets are dense
 They are made up of three groups of substances
 They are composed mainly of rocky and metallic materials
 They contain more ice than Jovian planets
 They contain relatively small amounts of water


4  Paragraph 4 supports each of the following statements about Saturn EXCEPT
 It is less dense than any of the terrestrial planets
 It contains no rocky material
 It contains ices
 It contains a large percentage of gases



5  The word meager in the passage is closest in meaning to
 rich
 thin
 unique
 complex

6  According to paragraph 5  which of the following statements is true of both Jovian and terrestrial planets
  The thicker the atmosphere  the smaller the planet s mass
  The more varied the gases in the atmosphere  the higher the temperature
  The higher the surface gravity  the higher the escape velocity
  The less the atmosphere contributes to the total mass  the lower the temperature

7  According to paragraph 5  what is a major reason that Jovian planets have much thicker atmospheres than terrestrial planets do
  Jovian planets have lower surface gravities
 Jovian planets have lower temperatures
 Jovian planets have lower escape velocities
 Jovian planets  gas molecules have higher average speeds

8  Paragraph 5 supports which of the following statements about the ability of planets to retain gases
 More massive planets are less able to retain gases than less massive ones
 Planets are more likely to retain heavy gases than light gases
 Jovian planets are unlikely to retain the lightest gases
 Only terrestrial planets have been able to retain carbon dioxide











9  In calling the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun and all the planets are thought to have condensed  primordial   the author means that the cloud was
 immense in size
 composed of similar particles
 present at the very beginning of our solar system s formation
 created from a great variety of different materials

10  The word eventually in the passage is closest in meaning to
 over time
 long ago
 simply
 certainly

11  According to paragraph 6  what is a possible explanation for the lack of light gases and ices on terrestrial planets
 The location of terrestrial planets caused them to lose some of the materials they once contained
 Terrestrial planets were formed much later than Jovian planets
 The composition of terrestrial planets was different from that of Jupiter
 Terrestrial planets were formed out of different material than the Sun was
