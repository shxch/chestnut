A  Hi   I hope you can help me   I just transferred from Northeastern State University near Chicago
B  Well welcome to Central University  But Chicago is such a great city  Why did you leave
A  Everyone asks that  It s my hometown  And it was sure convenient to go to a school nearby  But Northeastern is still fairly small  And it doesn t have the program I m interested in  I want to major in international studies  And the only program int the State is here
A  We do have a great program  Well how did you get interested in international studies
B  My family hosted a few foreign exchange students while I was growing up  Then I took part in an international summer program after I graduated from high school  I thought I really I like meeting people from all over  getting to know them
A  OH  Ok  And that led you to our program  Right now though I think you are looking for a job
B  Yeah  a part time job on campus  I thought I d save money  being away from the big city  But it doesn t seem to be working that way  Anyway I m not having much luck
A  I m not surprised  Most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester  What work experience have you had
B  Well  I worked in the university library last year  But I already checked at the library here  They said their remaining positions were for work study students getting financial aid  I ve never run into that before
A  Well  I guess each school has its own policies  Uh  we really don t have much right now  You might be better  If you really want something  how are your computer skills
B  About average I d say  I helped teach some of the basic computer classes  Northeastern offers for new users  if that helps any
A  OK  The technology support department needs people to work its helpdesk  It s basically a customer service job  answering questions  helping people solve their computer problems  give you a chance to develop your people skills
B  Something every diplomat needs  But is there some problem  I mean why is the job still open
A  Well  they have extended hours  from 6am to 2am every day  So they need a large staff  But right now they only need people early mornings  late nights  and weekends  You d probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot  On the bright side you ll probably be able to get some studying done between calls  At least it could be a start and then you can try for better hours next semester
B  Um  I see why the hours might be a problem  But I guess I can t afford to be too picky if I want a job  Still maybe we can work something out
