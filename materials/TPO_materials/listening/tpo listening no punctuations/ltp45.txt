Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a journalism class  The professor has been discussing newspapers

Professor
About 40 years ago  half of all Americans felt they d be lost without a daily newspaper  But today  only one in ten Americans say they d be lost without a paper  In fact  today  half of all Americans say they don t need a newspaper at all  And so people in the newspaper industry are trying to figure out how they can get more people reading the newspaper more often  They re trying to crack journalism s riddle for the ages  what makes people read newspapers  OK  well  let me ask you as a journalism student  what do you think is the answer to this question  Elizabeth

Female student
U m  I would probably try to improve the content of the newspaper
Professor
Better content  Hmm  You mean like well written editorials and articles
Female student
Well  I mean provide more interesting content  like  I would first try to find out what readers really want to read       and then put that into the paper
Professor
Yes  in fact  not too long ago  there was an extensive study conducted to investigate what draws people to newspapers  Uh  they found out that there s a clear  strong link between satisfaction with content and overall readership  Those newspapers that contained what the readers wanted most brought in the most readers  No big surprise there  right  So  what kind of content brings in readers  The study found that people centered local news ranks at the top of the list       stories about ordinary people  For example  you could write about the experiences of those who were involved in a news story  and their friends and relatives       The vantage points would be those of ordinary people  not of police or other officials       OK  Now the study also showed that people want more stories about movies  TV  and weather  and fewer stories and photos about natural disasters and accidents       So  to get reader satisfaction  you need to select the right topics  and within those topics  the right news events or stories to cover  Yes  James

Male student
It seems to me that a lot of what you just mentioned doesn t line up with the principles of good journalism  Catering to readers  tastes may improve overall readership  but what about the social responsibilities that newspapers have  I mean  there are some topics that newspapers need to write about in order to serve the public interest  Those topics may not always be fun and interesting for the average reader  but it s still the newspaper s responsibility to make that information available to the public
Professor
That s a good point  You need a good mix of content  You can t just rush towards an attractive topic and forget about the reporting role of newspapers  There s a danger of going soft newspapers do have to perform their obligations to citizens  So what newspapers sometimes do is to combine serious journalism with a reader friendly presentation  Um  let me give you an example  When the justice department opened an investigation on the local police some pretty serious stuff that could be boring to some readers well  one local newspaper ran a lead story on their front page  but they also simplified the format by including small breakout boxes that presented in a nutshell the highlights of the story  That way  they could report the serious stories they needed to report  and  and still hold their readers  attention  OK  U h  going back to the research on readership growth we were talking about       Uh  the most vital step of all  the study shows  may be making the paper easier to use  How can we make the paper  easier to use   Well  it means stories need to include information  such as phone numbers  times  dates  addresses  Web sites and the like  so that readers can  go and do  things based on what they ve read
Female student
Professor Ellington  Um  when you said we need to make the paper  easier to user  I thought you were gonna say something about use of graphics  colors  and stuff like that
Professor
Well  I guess those things do help in a way  but it turned out that those contemporary touches  uh  such as more attractive designs  extensive use of color  and informational graphics matter much less than you d expect  Surprising  isn t it
Female student
Yeah  it is       Um  how about service  Does the study say anything about improving service  I don t think people are gonna subscribe if the paper doesn t arrive  or shows up late
Professor
Or shows up wet  which by the way  happened to me this morning  Oh  absolutely  Service affects readership  In fact  improving your service is much more likely to increase your readership than making changes in your editorial content       Not only on time delivery in good condition  but also things like efficient billing  affordability  um      Yes
Female student
They could also  like  increase the number of sites where they sell single copies
Professor
Certainly that s one way to improve service
