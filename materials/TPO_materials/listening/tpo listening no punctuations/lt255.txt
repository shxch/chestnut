Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the ancient Egyptian writings found in ancient Egypt on walls  monuments and on the inside and outside of temples  Hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 1600 years ago  And it mystified the most brilliant minds in the study of Egyptian artifacts and archaeology for many many centuries  Finally  the possibility of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery  in 1799  of the Rosetta Stone
The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous archaeological artifact ever discovered  It contains the same exact text written in three different alphabets  Greek  demotic  hieroglyphic
But we didn t even know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone contain the same information  And two of the three alphabets are ancient Egyptian scripts that stop being used  the hieroglyphic and the demotic the demotic script found on the Rosetta Stone  well  demotic was not as elaborate as hieroglyphic writing  It was used for more mundane matters  oh  like administrative documents  These ancient Egyptian scripts were replaced by Coptic scripts  But eventually  the Arabic language replaced Coptic and this cut off the linguistic link between ancient and modern Egypt
Now  the Rosetta Stone was remarkable because as I said  on it  was the same text in three different alphabets  Greek  demotic and hieroglyphic  The Stone was essentially the dictionary that scholars needed to interpret the meaning of the hieroglyphs  And it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally decipher and understand what was written on the stone
Thomas young  an English scholar  was the first to seriously attempt to decipher the symbols on the Rosetta Stone  He suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols  that they represented its sounds rather than pictures  Until then  all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs  that they symbolize objects or concepts  Thomas Young focused his attention on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word  the name of a King or Queen  He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler Ptolemy  since Ptolemy was also written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name  And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words  Strangely though  he gave into the dominant thesis of the day that hieroglyphs were pictographs  He actually dismissed his own findings as an anomaly because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek  not Egyptian  In other words  he figured it was an exception to the rule  It was phonetic because it was Greek  not Egyptian  How else could an Egyptian depict a Greek name other than spell it out  And that brings us to the hero of our story  Jean Francois Champollion
Champollion built on Young s work  showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of Kings and Queens like Alexander or Cleopatra  But his critics noted that this was still not traditional Egyptian names  He hadn t done any more than Young had been able to do  so he couldn t disprove the dominant theory
Then in 1822  Champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that contain traditional Egyptian names  The first two of these symbols were unknown  but Champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an  S  sound  He then drew on his linguistic knowledge to arrive at the solution to the problem  You see  unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to crack the code  Champollion happened to be fluent in Coptic  He wondered  and this was the real breakthrough  if Coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta stone  And if so  then perhaps that first disc shape symbol might represent the Sun  And the Coptic word for Sun is  ra   See where this is headed  So if the symbol were Coptic  the first symbol would be  ra   And then an unknown symbol followed by a double  S  sound  Was this  Champollion wondered  the name Rameses1  He was eventually able to confirm that it was  So  he had figured it out  Hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic  they represented sounds  not pictures  and the underlying language was Coptic  A lot of work remained  but Champollion had cracked the code
