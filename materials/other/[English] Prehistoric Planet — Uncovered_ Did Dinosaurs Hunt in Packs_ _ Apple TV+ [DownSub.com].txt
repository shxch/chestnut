When we talk of dinosaur
fossils, we tend to think of
their bones.

But they also left behind other
evidence of their existence.

Their footprints.

Like this one.

Sometimes these prints occur
not singly but in groups,

David Attenborough:
suggesting that they lived in
groups.

And if they lived in groups,
maybe they hunted in groups.

(Growling)

David Attenborough:
The idea that dinosaurs had
the intelligence 

David Attenborough:
to cooperate and to hunt
together may seem surprising.

David Attenborough:
But like all the behavior in
Prehistoric Planet,

David Attenborough:
there is scientific evidence for
deadly dinosaurs joining forces.

(Wind blowing)

Dr. Susannah Maidment:
In the fossil record, we
sometimes find accumulations 

Dr. Susannah Maidment:
called monospecific bone beds.

And these are accumulations of a
single species of dinosaur.

♪♪

Dr. Susannah Maidment:
These can lead us to conclude
that these animals

Dr. Susannah Maidment:
were actually living alongside
each other.

♪♪

David Attenborough:
And at one site, multiple
footprints were discovered.

♪♪

In 2014, scientists in British
Columbia discovered trackways

Dr. Darren Naish:
made by 3 Tyrannosaurs that
had all been walking side by side.

Dr. Darren Naish:
These animals had all been
moving together in the same direction

Dr. Darren Naish:
all within just a few meters of each
other.

As well as fossil evidence of
group hunting,

further evidence comes from the
behavior of living hunters,

who often have to form teams in
order to take on large
herbivores.

♪♪

David Attenborough:
Today this behavior is seen in
large intelligent mammals.

David Attenborough:
Lions, wolves...and orca.

David Attenborough:
All working together.

David Attenborough:
But there are examples of group
hunting

David Attenborough:
in dinosaurs closest living
relatives too.

In birds, the modern cousins of
Tyrannosaurs, group hunting
behavior is fairly common.

It's seen in various sea
birds, in some crows and also in
various falcons, hawks and eagles.

Dr. Darren Naish:
In some species, like the
American Harris Hawk,

Dr. Darren Naish:
groups of related individuals
work together to capture prey.

David Attenborough:
Once more, studies have shown
that when times are hard 

David Attenborough:
and very large prey becomes
available 

David Attenborough:
predators are much more likely
to cooperate

David Attenborough:
and they then form packs.

(Wind blowing)

(Growling)

David Attenborough:
These are just the conditions
in the harsh arctic winter

David Attenborough:
of the late Cretaceous, that you
might expect to see group hunting Tyrannosaurs

David Attenborough:
tackling the ice world's
largest, most formidable prey.
