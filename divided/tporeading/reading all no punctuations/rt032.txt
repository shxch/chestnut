Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer

The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s  This region has a semiarid climate  and for 50 years after its settlement  it supported a low intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming  In the early twentieth century  however  it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge aquifer  a rock layer containing large quantities of groundwater   This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians  who once inhabited the region
The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583 000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota  Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30 000 years  Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron  but unfortunately  under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region  rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal  amounting to about half a centimeter a year
The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930s  The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture  especially from the 1950s onward  transformed the economy of the region  More than 100 000 wells now tap the Ogallala  Modern irrigation devices  each capable of spraying 4 5 million liters of water a day  have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops  Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton  sorghum  wheat  and corn grown in the United States  In addition  40 percent of American grain fed beef cattle are fattened here
This unprecedented development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate that is  virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically  In the 1930s  wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters  currently  they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more  In places  the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year  necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever more powerful pumps  It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates  much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years  The situation is most critical in Texas  where the climate is driest  the greatest amount of water is being pumped  and the aquifer contains the least water  It is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will  by the year 2030  support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated acreage in Texas that is supported in 1980
The reaction of farmers to the inevitable depletion of the Ogallala varies  Many have been attempting to conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that require less water  Others  however  have adopted the philosophy that it is best to use the water while it is still economically profitable to do so and to concentrate on high value crops such as cotton  The incentive of the farmers who wish to conserve water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water  and in the process are drawing down the entire region s water supplies
In the face of the upcoming water supply crisis  a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to transport vast quantities of water by canal or pipeline from the Mississippi  the Missouri  or the Arkansas rivers  Unfortunately  the cost of water obtained through any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at least tenfold  making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets  Somewhat more promising have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water  water in the soil  above the water table by injecting compressed air into the ground  Even if this process proves successful  however  it would almost triple water costs  Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution  as new strains of drought resistant crops continue to be developed  Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be  it is evident that within the High Plains  irrigation water will never again be the abundant  inexpensive resource it was during the agricultural boom years of the mid twentieth century

 Despite the current impressive size of the Ogallala aquifer  the region s climate keeps the rates of water addition very small

The Ogallala aquifer is a large underground source of water in the High Plains region of the United States




Answer choices

 The use of the Ogallala for irrigation has allowed the High Plains to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States
 Given the aquifer s low recharge rate  its use for irrigation is causing water tables to drop and will eventually lead to its depletion
 Releasing capillary water and introducing drought resistant crops are less promising solutions to the water supply crisis than bringing in river water
 The periodic deepening of wells and the use of more powerful pumps would help increase the natural recharge rate of the Ogallala
 In Texas  a great deal of attention is being paid to genetic engineering because it is there that the most critical situation exists
 Several solutions to the upcoming water supply crisis have been proposed  but none of them promises to keep the costs of irrigation low
