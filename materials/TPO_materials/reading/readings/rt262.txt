Survival of Plants and Animals in Desert Conditions
The harsh conditions in deserts are intolerable for most plants and animals  Despite these conditions  however  many varieties of plants and animals have adapted to deserts in a number of ways  Most plant tissues die if their water content falls too low  the nutrients that feed plants are transmitted by water  water is a raw material in the vital process of photosynthesis  and water regulates the temperature of a plant by its ability to absorb heat and because water vapor lost to the atmosphere through the leaves helps to lower plant temperatures  Water controls the volume of plant matter produced  The distribution of plants within different areas of desert is also controlled by water  Some areas  because of their soil texture  topographical position  or distance from rivers or groundwater  have virtually no water available to plants  whereas others do

The nature of plant life in deserts is also highly dependent on the fact that they have to adapt to the prevailing aridity  There are two general classes of vegetation  long lived perennials  which may be succulent  water storing  and are often dwarfed and woody  and annuals or ephemerals  which have a short life cycle and may form a fairly dense stand immediately after rain

The ephemeral plants evade drought  Given a year of favorable precipitation  such plants will develop vigorously and produce large numbers of flowers and fruit  This replenishes the seed content of the desert soil  The seeds then lie dormant until the next wet year  when the desert blooms again

The perennial vegetation adjusts to the aridity by means of various avoidance mechanisms  Most desert plants are probably best classified as xerophytes  They possess drought resisting adaptations  loss of water through the leaves is reduced by means of dense hairs covering waxy leaf surfaces  by the closure of pores during the hottest times to reduce water loss  and by the rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of the dry season  Some xerophytes  the succulents  including cacti   store water in their structures  Another way of countering drought is to have a limited amount of mass above ground and to have extensive root networks below ground  It is not unusual for the roots of some desert perennials to extend downward more than ten meters  Some plants are woody in type  an adaptation designed to prevent collapse of the plant tissue when water stress produces wilting  Another class of desert plant is the phreatophyte  These have adapted to the environment by the development of long taproots that penetrate downward until they approach the assured water supply provided by groundwater  Among these plants are the date palm  tamarisk  and mesquite  They commonly grow near stream channels  springs  or on the margins of lakes

Animals also have to adapt to desert conditions  and they may do it through two forms of behavioral adaptation  they either escape or retreat  Escape involves such actions as aestivation  a condition of prolonged dormancy  or torpor  during which animals reduce their metabolic rate and body temperature during the hot season or during very dry spells

Seasonal migration is another form of escape  especially for large mammals or birds  The term retreat is applied to the short term escape behavior of desert animals  and it usually assumes the pattern of a daily rhythm  Birds shelter in nests  rock overhangs  trees  and dense shrubs to avoid the hottest hours of the day  while mammals like the kangaroo rat burrow underground
Some animals have behavioral  physiological  and morphological  structural  adaptations that enable them to withstand extreme conditions  For example  the ostrich has plumage that is so constructed that the feathers are long but not too dense  When conditions are hot  the ostrich erects them on its back  thus increasing the thickness of the barrier between solar radiation and the skin  The sparse distribution of the feathers  however  also allows considerable lateral air movement over the skin surface  thereby permitting further heat loss by convection  Furthermore  the birds orient themselves carefully with regard to the Sun and gently flap their wings to increase convection cooling

1  According to paragraph 1  water provides all of the following essential functions for plants EXCEPT
  improving plants  ability to absorb sunlight
  preventing plants from becoming overheated
  transporting nutrients
  serving as a raw material for photosynthesis



2  Paragraph 3 suggests that during a dry year ephemerals
  produce even more seeds than in a wet year
  do not sprout from their seeds
  bloom much later than in a wet year
  are more plentiful than perennials

3  How is paragraph 2 related to paragraph 3
  Paragraph 2 provides a general description of desert plants  and paragraph 3 provides a scientific explanation for these observations
  Paragraph 2 divides desert plants into two categories  and paragraph 3 provides further information about one of these categories
  Paragraph 2 proposes one way of dividing desert plants into categories  and paragraph 3 explains one problem with this method of classification
  Paragraph 2 discusses two categories of desert plants  and paragraph 3 introduces a third category of plants

4  In saying that ephemerals will develop  vigorously  when there is favorable precipitation  the author means that their development will be
  sudden
  early
  gradual
  strong and healthy

5  The word  countering  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  eliminating
  making use of
  acting against
  experiencing

6  According to paragraph 4  some desert plants with root systems that are extraordinarily well developed have
  relatively little growth aboveground
  very leafy aboveground structures
  non woody plant tissue resistant to wilting
  water stored within their roots

7  The word  assured  in the passage is closest in meaning to
  pure
  diminished
  guaranteed
  deep

    8  What do  the date palm  tamarisk  and mesquite  have in common
  They are always found together
  They depend on surface water provided by streams  springs  and lakes
  They are phreatophytes
  Their roots are capable of breaking through hard soils




9  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
  One way animals escape is by entering a state of extended dormancy  known as aestivation  during the hottest and driest times of year
  Animals can escape without using direct action  or aestivation  simply by reducing their metabolic rate and body temperature
  The actions that an animal uses to escape are known as aestivation  which sometimes involves a reduction in metabolic rate or body temperature
  When the weather is especially hot and dry  an animal may suffer from a condition known as aestivation  at which point the animal needs to escape




   10  It can be inferred from paragraph 6 that all of the places desert animals retreat to
  provide shade from the sun
  sometimes become crowded
  are places where supplies of food are plentiful
  leave the animals vulnerable to predators


11  According to paragraph 7  what special adaptation helps the ostrich cope with hot desert conditions
  Each of its feathers is very short and dense
  Its wings produce only lateral air movement when flapping
 Its feathers are very thickly set on both its back and its wings
  It can make its feathers stand up on its back



12  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
The increase in reward still did not attract young people to this hard life  and convicted criminals and slaves were pressed into services
Where would the sentence best fit
