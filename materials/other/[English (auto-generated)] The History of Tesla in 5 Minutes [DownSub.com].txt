in the late 90s a groundbreaking

electric car called the ev1 quickly drew

a loyal and hardcore following but the

spark behind GM's first Eevee ended

abruptly in 2003 electric car

enthusiasts gathered in California and a

mock funeral for the car which was

discontinued and cancelled by GM the

automaker claimed there was not enough

market demand to keep the Eevee dream

alive

so they rounded up the cars shipped them

off to the desert and crush them under

the scorching Sun the death the ev1 was

a defining moment for electric vehicles

not because it was an early setback for

the green movement but because it was

also a catalyst for rebirth the

destruction of the ev1 inspired the

creation of Tesla Motors in 2003 to

Silicon Valley engineers Martin Eberhard

and Mark tarpon and sold their ebook

business for 187 million dollars and

started Tesla to build a greener car

Elon Musk joined as an early investor

leading the series a financing and

taking on several other roles as well

Tesla's plan was simple but potentially

genius one focus on lithium-ion

batteries which they expected to get

cheaper and more powerful for many years

to start with a high margin a

high-performance sports car the aim was

to shed existing stigma around EVs and

used the revenue to fund a more

affordable car and three achieve

economies of scale so that Tesla could

target other segments like semi trucks

Tesla also planned to integrate energy

generation and storage in the home and

develop other emerging technologies like

autonomous vehicles with the plan set

the company was ready to build its

high-performance low volume sports car

the Roadster Tesla wanted to reduce

complex manufacturing by plugging the

Tesla develop battery and powertrain

into the existing chassis of the Lotus

Elise however the company began

customizing more and more parts which

made costs spiral out of control by the

end the Roadster and the Elise had

little in

common just 7% of parts by count Tesla

was on the verge of bankruptcy and

several CEOs came and went

eventually Elon Musk took the job in

October 2008 musk made drastic changes

to save the company

he cut 25% of the workforce recalled 75%

the roadsters raised 40 million dollars

of debt financing formed a strategic

partnership with Daimler and borrowed

465 million dollars from the US

government a total of two thousand four

hundred and fifty roadsters were made

and the iconic car became the

springboard for the evie revolution each

roadster had a 992 pound lithium cobalt

oxide battery giving the car an

impressive 244 mile range this reduced

range anxiety and made v's more

appealing to the masses in 2010 Tesla

IPO Don the Nasdaq raising 226 million

dollars it was the first American car

company to go public since Ford in 1956

the car maker then aimed for a wider

market by focusing on two new cars Model

S and Model X the two models were poised

for success but Tesla's ultimate

potential still seemed limited by the

high cost of lithium-ion batteries after

all if batteries were too expensive

EVs could never compete with gas on

price and they would never be mainstream

to combat this in 2013

Elon Musk revealed ambitious plans for

the Tesla gigafactory a massive

operation to reach economies of scale in

lithium ion battery production and

ultimately make v's cheaper than

gas-powered vehicles as Tesla built its

Giga factory it hit many other

milestones the company released

autopilot giving the Model S

semi-autonomous capabilities the

powerwall was revealed a lithium ion

battery for the home finally it

announced the model 3 the car for the

masses in 2016 by the end of 2017

Tesla passed Ford and market value just

seven years after its IPO to understand

Tesla's ambitions for the future you

need to know two things their mission

which is to accelerate the world's

transit

into sustainable energy and their

strategy which is to productize the

factory so that vehicle assembly can be

automated at a revolutionary pace Tesla

knows that building a few electric cars

won't make a dent in the global energy

picture which is why it's using its

factory tech to go bigger and better

the Tesla semi will go from zero to 60

with an 80,000 pound payload in just 20

seconds musk also says he wants to build

a pickup truck an Eevee is designed for

a high passenger density urban transport

the model y will be a crossover built on

the model 3 platform and there will be

an ultra low cost model built as the

company achieved scale to do this it

will also need bigger and better Giga

factories Tesla also wants to change the

entire energy paradigm by popularizing

an eco system that allows homeowners to

run their appliances and cars off green

energy and even sell it back to the grid

Tesla's goals are ambitious and the

company's strategy is even considered

naive by some but if Elon Musk and Tesla

can perfect the building of the machine

that builds the machine all bets will be

off the question is will Tesla achieve
