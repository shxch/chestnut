The Geologic History of the Mediterranean

In 1970 geologists Kenneth J  Hsu and William B F  Ryan were collecting research data while aboard the oceanographic research vessel Glomar Challenger  An objective of this particular cruise was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean and to resolve questions about its geologic history  One question was related to evidence that the invertebrate fauna  animals without spines  of the Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6 million years ago  Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out  although a few hardy species survived  A few managed to migrate into the Atlantic  Somewhat later  the migrants returned  bringing new species with them  Why did the near extinction and migrations occur

Another task for the Glomar Challenger s scientists was to try to determine the origin of the domelike masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean seafloor  These structures had been detected years earlier by echo sounding instruments  but they had never been penetrated in the course of drilling  Were they salt domes such as are common along the United States Gulf Coast  and if so  why should there have been so much solid crystalline salt beneath the floor of the Mediterranean

With question such as these clearly before them  the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the Mediterranean to search for the answers  On August 23  1970  they recovered a sample  The sample consisted of pebbles of hardened sediment that had once been soft  deep sea mud  as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock  Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent  In the days following  samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor  Furthermore  the gypsum was found to possess peculiarities of composition and structure that suggested it had formed on desert flats  Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils  indicating open ocean conditions  As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin  the scientists took solid  shiny  crystalline salt from the core barrel  Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt

The time had come to formulate a hypothesis  The investigators theorized that about 20 million years ago  the Mediterranean was a broad seaway linked to the Atlantic by two narrow straits  Crustal movements closed the straits  and the landlocked Mediterranean began to evaporate  Increasing salinity caused by the evaporation resulted in the extermination of scores of invertebrate species  Only a few organisms especially tolerant of very salty conditions remained  As evaporation continued  the remaining brine  salt water  became so dense that the calcium sulfate of the hard layer was precipitated  In the central deeper part of the basin  the last of the brine evaporated to precipitate more soluble sodium chloride  salt   Later  under the weight of overlying sediments  this salt flowed plastically upward to form salt domes  Before this happened  however  the Mediterranean was a vast desert 3 000 meters deep  Then  about 5 5 million years ago came the deluge  As a result of crustal adjustments and faulting  the Strait of Gibraltar  where the Mediterranean now connects to the Atlantic  opened  and water cascaded spectacularly back into the Mediterranean  Turbulent waters tore into the hardened salt flats  broke them up  and ground them into the pebbles observed in the first sample taken by the Challenger  As the basin was refilled  normal marine organisms returned  Soon layer of oceanic ooze began to accumulate above the old hard layer
The salt and gypsum  the faunal changes  and the unusual gravel provided abundant evidence that the Mediterranean was once a desert

Gypsum  a mineral made of calcium sulfate and water

 achievement
 requirement
 purpose
 feature


2  Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a change that occurred in the fauna of the Mediterranean
 Most invertebrate species disappeared during a wave of extinctions
 A few hardy species wiped out many of the Mediterranean s invertebrates
 Some invertebrates migrated to Atlantic Ocean
 New species of fauna populated the Mediterranean when the old migrants returned














      3  What does the author imply by saying  Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent
 The most obvious explanation for the origin of the pebbles was not supported by the evidence
 The geologists did not find as many pebbles as they expected
 The geologists were looking for a particular kind of pebble
 The different pebbles could not have come from only one source

4ï¼ŽWhich of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the solid gypsum layer
 It did not contain any marine fossil
 It had formed in open ocean conditions
 It had once been soft  deep sea mud
 It contained sediment from nearby deserts

5  Select the TWO answer choice from paragraph 3 that identify materials discovered in the deepest part of the Mediterranean basin  To receive credit you must select TWO answers
 Volcanic rock fragments
 Thin silt layers
 Soft  deep sea mud
 Crystalline salt

6  What is the main purpose of paragraph 3
 To describe the physical evidence collected by Hsu and Ryan
 To explain why some of the questions posed earlier in the passage could not be answered by the findings of the Glomar Challenger
 To evaluate techniques used by Hsu and Ryan to explore the sea floor
 To describe the most difficult problems faced by the Glomar Challenger expedition






7  According to paragraph 4  which of the following was responsible for the evaporation of the Mediterranean s waters
 The movements of Earth s crust
 The accumulation of sediment layers
 Changes in the water level of the Atlantic Ocean
 Changes in Earth s temperature
8  The word  scores  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 members
 large numbers
 populations
 different types
9  According to paragraph 4  what caused most invertebrate species in the Mediterranean to become extinct
 The evaporation of chemicals necessary for their survival
 Crustal movements that connected the Mediterranean to the saltier Atlantic
 The migration of new species through the narrow straits
 Their inability to tolerate the increasing salt content of the Mediterranean
10  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 The strait of Gibraltar reopened when the Mediterranean and the Atlantic became connected and the cascades of water from one sea to the other caused crustal adjustments and faulting
 The Mediterranean was dramatically refilled by water from the Atlantic when crustal adjustments and faulting opened the Strait of Gibraltar  the place where the two seas are joined
 The cascades of water from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean were not as spectacular as the crustal adjustments and faulting that occurred when the Strait of Gibraltar was connected to those seas
 As a result of crustal adjustments and faulting and the creation of the Strait of Gibraltar  the Atlantic and Mediterranean were connected and became a single sea with spectacular cascades of water between them
    11  The word  Turbulent  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 Fresh
 Deep
 Violent
 Temperate


12  Look at the four squares    that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
Thus  scientists had information about the shape of the domes but not about their chemical composition and origin
Where would the sentence best fit

13   Direction An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

An expedition to the Mediterranean answered some long standing questions about the ocean s history




Answer choices

 The Glomar Challenger expedition investigated changes in invertebrate fauna and some unusual geologic features
 Researchers collected fossils to determine which new species migrated from the Atlantic with older species
 Scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger were the first to discover the existence of domelike masses underneath the seafloor
 Samples recovered from the expedition revealed important differences in chemical composition and fossil distribution among the sediment layers
 Evidence collected by the Glomar Challenger supports geologists  beliefs that the Mediterranean had evaporated and become a desert  before it refilled with water
 Mediterranean salt domes formed after crustal movements opened the straits between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic  and the Mediterranean refilled with water
