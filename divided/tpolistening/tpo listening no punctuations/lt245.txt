TPO 24 Lecture3 Archaeology  Megafauna in North America
Narrator  Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class
Professor  Between 11 000 and 10 000 B C E   North America was populated by a wide variety of great beasts  like mammoth and mastodons  both elephant like creatures with big tusks  and camels  giant sloths  the list goes on  By about 10 000 B C E   all those giant creatures  the Metgauna of North America were gone  We don t know exactly what happened to them  but there are some theories
One theory is that they were hunted to extinction by humans  The humans who coexisted with these giant species in North America at that time were what we today called the Clovis People  And there is a Clovis site in a valley in southern California where the remains of thirteen mammoths were found  And spear points  tools for processing meat  and fire places
That would appear to be some pretty compelling evidences  Mammoth bones have also been found at some other Clovis sites
But then at other Clovis sites  there s also a lot of evidence that the Clovis people mostly gather plants and hunted small game  like rabbits and wild turkeys  Also there are several places in North America where you have natural accumulations of mammoth bones that look very similar to the accumulations at the Clovis site  except there s no human debris  where the mammoth almost certainly died as a result of some kind of natural disaster  So I think it is quite likely that those thirteen mammoths in southern California also died of natural causes  and that the Clovis people simply took advantage of the situation  Um   OK  That s the hunting theory
Now let s look at another theory  uh  an alternative to the hunting theory  the climate change theory  At around 11 500 B C E ï¼Œthe world was coming out of an Ice Age  And with that came increased seasonality  that is  the summers became warmer  and the winters actually became colder  These extreme shifts would have put a lot of stress on the bodies of animals that were used to a more moderate range of temperatures
But the most important impact of this increased seasonality may very well have been its effect on the distribution of plants
Today we take for granted that there horizontal bands of plant communities  In the far north  it is tundra  which gives way to forest as you move southward  And even farther south  grasslands take over  But during the Ice Age  these plant communities actually grew together  mixed with one another  So Ice Age animals had access to many different types of plants  different types of food  But when the seasons became more distinct  the plant communities were pulled apart  that meant  in any given area  there was less plant diversity  And as a result  uh  so the theory goes  the Ice Age animals that depended on plant diversity couldn t survive  And the great beasts were the ones that needed the most diversity in their diet  Again  we have what at first seems like a pretty attractive theory  but then  how do you explain the fact that this has happened before  You know  global cooling followed by global warming  and there was no extinction then
Uh  you know  I recently read an interesting article about an archaeologist who tried to solve this puzzle with the help of his computer  What he did was  he wrote a computer program to simulate what would happen to mammoth under certain conditions  Say  for example  there is a drought for a couple of decades  or hunters are killing or five percent of the population  and so on
One thing he found was that humans didn t necessarily have to kill these animals in great numbers in order to nudge them toward extinction  That s because very large animals have a slow rate of reproduction  so all you have to do is remove a few young females from the herd  and you can  fairly quickly  significantly reduce the population  And then he came up with a scenario that combined some hunting by humans with some environmental stress  and   Bang  The simulated mammoths were extinct within decades
So it seems the mixture of hunting and climate change is a likely scenario  Uh  of course  computer simulations are not a substitute for hard evidence
