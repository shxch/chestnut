TPO 24 Conversation 2ä¸€Student & Geography Professor
Narrator  Listen to a conversation between a student and his geography professor
Student  Hi  Professor Brown
Professor  Hi  Paul  What can I do for you
Student  I have a question about the final exam  I mean  will it cover everything we ve done all term  Or just what we ve been doing since the mid term exam
Professor  Everything we ve done all term
Student  Oh  boy  You know  I am still not too clear about the hydrologic cycle  um  the transfer of water back and forth between the earth and the atmosphere  I really blew the question about it on the mid term exam  I want to do better on the final exam  But I am still having trouble with it
Professor  Well  uh  have you been to the tutoring center
Student  No  not for geography anyway  Isn t that just for when you need help with writing  like an essay or a research paper
Professor  Oh  no  you can get tutoring in a lot of subjects  Some graduate students from this department tutor there
Student  That s good to know  But I hardly go there because I have a part time job  I never seem to be free when they are open
Professor  Well  they will be extending their hours when final exams begin  You might try then  But um    Well  since you are here now  can I help you with something
Student  Well  the hydrologic cycle  I remember we went over a diagram in class  And from what I remember  water changes back and forth from water in lakes and oceans to vapor  and then back to water again when it falls as rain or snow  as precipitation  It s constantly being recycled through evaporation and condensation
Professor  That s it  Basically  Um    so exactly what is it you don t understand
Student  OK  I guess what I am really confused about is how the topography of the land  the mountains and valleys and stuff  affects precipitation
Professor  OK  Good question  Precipitation is influenced by topography among other things  Um  why don t we talk about lake effect snow  It s a phenomenon that occurs anywhere you have a large lake that doesn t freeze and have cold air flowing over it  mostly in the Northern Hemisphere
Student  Like the great lakes in the United States
Professor  Yeah  What happens is that the cold arctic air blows across the lake from the north in winter  And as the air crosses the lake  the lower layer is warmed by the lake water  which is much warmer than the arctic air  And as this air is warmed and picks up moisture  it becomes lighter than the air above it
Student  So it starts to rise  right
Professor  Yes  And clouds begin to form  When the air gets closer to the shore  it s slowed down by the land and starts to pile up  So it rises even faster because it has nowhere else to go  that s where topography comes into the picture
Student  And then it snows because as the air rises  it cools off and loses its capacity to hold water vapor
Professor  That s right
Student  OK  Thanks  Any chance you ll have this question on the final
Professor  I don t know yet  But you seem to have a handle on it
