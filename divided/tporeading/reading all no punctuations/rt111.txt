Ancient Egyptian Sculpture
In order to understand ancient Egyptian art  it is vital to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians  view of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them  Without this knowledge we can appreciate only the formal content of Egyptian art  and we will fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts that shaped it and caused it to adopt its distinctive forms  In fact  a lack of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures  Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in which the body turned and twisted through space like classical Greek statuary  Why do the artists seem to get left and right confused  And why did they not discover the geometric perspective as European artists did in the Renaissance  The answer to such questions has nothing to do with a lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists and everything to do with the purposes for which they were producing their art
The majority of three dimensional representations  whether standing  seated  or kneeling  exhibit what is called frontality  they face straight ahead  neither twisting nor turning  When such statues are viewed in isolation  out of their original context and without knowledge of their function  it is easy to criticize them for their rigid attitudes that remained unchanged for three thousand years  Frontality is  however  directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up  Statues were created not for their decorative effect but to play a primary role in the cults of the gods  the king  and the dead  They were designed to be put in places where these beings could manifest themselves in order to be the recipients of ritual actions  Thus it made sense to show the statue looking ahead at what was happening in front of it  so that the living performer of the ritual could interact with the divine or deceased recipient  Very often such statues were enclosed in rectangular shrines or wall niches whose only opening was at the front  making it natural for the statue to display frontality  Other statues were designed to be placed within an architectural setting  for instance  in front of the monumental entrance gateways to temples known as pylons  or in pillared courts  where they would be placed against or between pillars  their frontality worked perfectly within the architectural context
Statues were normally made of stone  wood  or metal  Stone statues were worked from single rectangular blocks of material and retained the compactness of the original shape  The stone between the arms and the body and between the legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in seated ones was not normally cut away  From a practical aspect this protected the figures against breakage and psychologically gives the images a sense of strength and power  usually enhanced by a supporting back pillar  By contrast  wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished work  and metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden core or cast by the lost wax process  The arms could be held away from the body and carry separate items in their hands  there is no back pillar  The effect is altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in stone  but because both perform the same function  formal wooden and metal statues still display frontality
Apart from statues representing deities  kings  and named members of the elite that can be called formal  there is another group of three dimensional representations that depicts generic figures  frequently servants  from the nonelite population  The function of these is quite different  Many are made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to serve the tomb owners in the afterlife  Unlike formal statues that are limited to static poses of standing  sitting  and kneeling  these figures depict a wide range of actions  such as grinding grain  baking bread  producing pots  and making music  and they are shown in appropriate poses  bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks
