When the Hawaiian Islands emerged from the sea as volcanoes  starting about five million years ago  they were far removed from other landmasses  Then  as blazing sunshine alternated with drenching rains  the harsh  barren surfaces of the black rocks slowly began to soften  Winds brought a variety of life forms

Spores light enough to float on the breezes were carried thousands of miles from more ancient lands and deposited at random across the bare mountain flanks  A few of these spores found a toehold on the dark  forbidding rocks and grew and began to work their transformation upon the land  Lichens were probably the first successful flora  These are not single individual plants  each one is a symbiotic combination of an alga and a fungus  The algae capture the sun s energy by photosynthesis and store it in organic molecules  The fungi absorb moisture and mineral salts from the rocks  passing these on in waste products that nourish algae  It is significant that the earliest living things that built communities on these islands are examples of symbiosis  a phenomenon that depends upon the close cooperation of two or more forms of life and a principle that is very important in island communities

Lichens helped to speed the decomposition of the hard rock surfaces  preparing a soft bed of soil that was abundantly supplied with minerals that had been carried in the molten rock from the bowels of Earth  Now  other forms of life could take hold  ferns and mosses  two of the most ancient types of land plants  that flourish even in rock crevices  These plants propagate by producing spores–tiny fertilized cells that contain all the instructions for making a new plant–but the spore are unprotected by any outer coating and carry no supply of nutrient  Vast numbers of them fall on the ground beneath the mother plants  Sometimes they are carried farther afield by water or by wind  But only those few spores that settle down in very favorable locations can start new life  the vast majority fall on barren ground  By force of sheer numbers  however  the mosses and ferns reached Hawaii  survived  and multiplied  Some species developed great size  becoming tree ferns that even now grow in the Hawaiian forests

Many millions of years after ferns evolved  but long before the Hawaiian Islands were born from the sea   another kind of flora evolved on Earth  the seed bearing plants  This was a wonderful biological invention  The seed has an outer coating that surrounds the genetic material of the new plant  and inside this covering is a concentrated supply of nutrients  Thus the seed s chances of survival are greatly enhanced over those of the naked spore  One type of seed bearing plant  the angiosperm  includes all forms of blooming vegetation  In the angiosperm the seeds are wrapped in an additional layer of covering  Some of these coats are hard–like the shell of a nut–for extra protection  Some are soft and tempting  like a peach or a cherry  In some angiosperms the seeds are equipped with gossamer wings  like the dandelion and milkweed seeds  These new characteristics offered better ways for the seed to move to new habitats  They could travel through the air  float in water  and lie dormant for many months

Plants with large  buoyant seeds like coconuts drift on ocean currents and are washed up on the shores  Remarkably resistant to the vicissitudes of ocean travel  they can survive prolonged immersion in saltwater when they come to rest on warm beaches and the conditions are favorable  the seed coats soften  Nourished by their imported supply of nutrients  the young plants push out their roots and establish their place in the sun

By means of these seeds  plants spread more widely to new locations  even to isolated islands like the Hawaiian archipelago  which lies more than 2 000 miles west of California and 3 500 miles east of Japan  The seeds of grasses  flowers  and blooming trees made the long trips to these islands   Grasses are simple forms of angiosperms that bear their encapsulated seeds on long stalks   In a surprisingly short time  angiosperms filled many of the land areas on Hawaii that had been bare



1  The phrase  at random  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 finally
 over a long period of time
 successfully
 without a definite pattern

2  It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the fungi in lichens benefit from their symbiotic relationship with algae in what way
 The algae help the fungi meet some of their energy needs
 The algae protect the fungi from the Sun s radiation
 The algae provide the fungi with greater space for absorbing water
 The fungi produce less waste in the presence of algae

3  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage  Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information
 Some of the earliest important examples of symbiosis the close cooperation of two or more living things occur in island communities
 Symbiosis the close cooperation of pairs or small groups of living organisms is especially important in these island environments
 The first organisms on these islands worked together closely in a relationship known as symbiosis  which is particularly important on islands
 It is significant to note that organisms in the beginning stages of the development of island life cannot survive without close cooperation












4  The word  abundantly  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 occasionally
 plentifully
 usefully
 fortunately


5  The word  propagate  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 multiply
 emerge
 live
 evolve


6  According to paragraph 3  what was the relationship between lichens and ferns in the development of plant life on Hawaii
 Ferns were able to grow because lichens created suitable soil
 The decomposition of ferns produced minerals that were used by lichens
 Lichens and ferns competed to grow in the same rocky environments
 Lichens and ferns were typically found together in volcanic areas















7  The word  This  in the passage refers to
 the spread of ferns and mosses in Hawaii
 the creation of the Hawaiian Islands
 the evolution of ferns
 the development of plants that produce seeds
  8  According to paragraph 4  why do seeds have a greater chance of survival than spores do  To receive credit  you must select TWO answer choices
 Seeds need less water to grow into a mature plant than spores do
 Seeds do not need to rely on outside sources of nutrients
 Seeds are better protected from environmental dangers than spores are
 Seeds are heavier than spores and are therefore more likely to take root and grow
9  Why does the author mention  a nut    a peach   and  a cherry
 To indicate that some seeds are less likely to survive than others
 To point out that many angiosperms can be eaten
 To provide examples of blooming plants
 To illustrate the variety of coverings among angiosperm seeds
 10  The word  dormant  in the passage is closest in meaning to
 hidden
 inactive
 underground
 preserved

11  According to paragraph 5  a major reason that coconuts can establish themselves in distant locations is that their seeds can
 survive long exposure to heat on island beaches
 float and survive for long periods in ocean water
 use saltwater for maintenance and growth
 maintain hard  protective coats even after growing roots
12  According to the passage  which of the following characteristics do spores and seeds have in common
 They may be surrounded by several layers of covering
 They are produced by flowering plants
 They may be spread by wind
 They are able to grow in barren soils


13  Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage
So since the chances of survival for any individual spore are small  the plants have to produce many spores in order to propagate
Where could the sentence best fit


14  Directions An introductory sentence for a brief summary of the passage is provided below  Complete the summary by selecting the THREE answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage  Some answer choices do not belong in the summary because they express ideas that are not presented in the passage or are minor ideas in the passage  This question is worth 2 points

After the formation of the Hawaiian Islands  much time passed before conditions were suitable for plant life











Answers Choices

 Algae are classified as symbiotic because they produce energy through the process of photosynthesis
 The first successful plants on Hawaii were probably lichens  which consist of algae and fungi living in a symbiotic relationship
 Lichens helped create favorable conditions for the growth of spore producing plants such as ferns and mosses
 Seed bearing plants evolved much later than spore producing plants  but both types of plants had evolved well before the formation of the Hawaiian Islands
 Unlike spores  seeds must move to new habitats in order to have a strong chance of survival and growth
 Seed bearing plants arrived and spread quickly in Hawaii  thanks to characteristics that increased their seeds  ability to survive and to move to different areas
